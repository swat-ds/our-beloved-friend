This was the day I first gave up to say a few words in a public First Day meeting. In great diffidence, dread and fear a strong persuasion attended my mind that if I did give up to speak all and even <persName key="w6wx87x7">my wife</persName> would detest and abhor me (which I believe was the works of the enemy) for I found it quite otherwise for <persName key="w6wx87x7">my wife</persName> spoke comfortably and encouragingly and indeed I believe I needed it, for I was almost ready to sink so that some said they pitied me. But an healing peace followed of was such a reward of confirmation that I have thought since it never would be erased come on me what will or may, and this letter from my dear cousin I received when I came out of meeting which was an healing cordial to me.<note resp="transcr">The published version of Hunt's Journal, 221-222, provides a slightly altered wording of this passage: This day, at our meeting, I first gave up to say a few words, I think, in great diffidence, dread and fear: a strong persuasion having attended my mind (which I since believe was the enemy's work) that if I did give up thus to expose myself in a public meeting, all would despise and abhor me, - even my bosom friend, and nearest connections: but I found it quite otherwise, for many of them, and especially , my wife, owned me in it, and spoke very comforting and encouragingly to me. The few words I had to communicate in that meeting were as follows: I believe it is needful, and would be profitable, when we are thus met together, diligently to watch against all such thoughts as we know ought not to have place in our minds. After I sat down, I felt such quietude, peace and composure, and a love that seemed to me to be new, that for some days I felt as if I had got into a new world. I loved not only my nearest connections, but all mankind, and even brutile creation, with a new love. This was such a confirmation of my being right, that I though it would never be erased, come on me what might. I felt as if I could turn my back on the world, and, if required, live like a hermit in the wilderness. Notwithstanding this confirmation of having been in my place at that time, I began to think that if ever it should be required of me again to say any thing in a public meeting, I should have a still more clear evidence of duty. Under this conclusion, I put off, and deferred speaking again for nearly a year; until I was in great danger of being quite bewildered on that hand. But as this kind of reasoning and false conclusion produced unsettlement, disquietude, and confusion of mind, so I found it safest to yield obedience to the clear manifestations of duty, without making a standard of my own.</note></p></div>
