<div type="entry"><p>Sitting by my fire this evening I was brought into a state of reflection about a small visit I performed in the neighborhood of North Wales in the State of Pennsylvania and thinking some of my kind young friends in that place would like to know how I come to do it and advantage I thought to receive by it and not knowing but an account of it writing would be of use to them I thought I would just sit down and relate the as near as my recollection would serve all the occurrences that was pleasing and those that were not. I left home on Second Day in the morning went I Rowland's in order to get some necessary things that should want while I was on the visit but being detained there three or four hours longer than I expected did not get to Josiah Roberts house till they had just done dinner Josiah's wife Mary informed me that Jos[indecipherable] had gone in his chair to</p>

<p>After taking dinner at Josiah I walked to uncle Joseph Matlack's enquiring if Josiah had come. My cousin informed me that Henry Warrington Jr. had taken the pains to assist them in getting to the river and making no stay walked on till I met Henry returning back in the chair who seemed a little surprised at seeing me come so late. I told him the reason, asking him if he thought I might cross the river handy and after a little more conversation with him</p>
<pb n="04" facs="sc203920"/>
<p>I told him I had come to this conclusion: if when I come to the river and there was so much ice or it was so much I could not get across I would just turn about and go home and be content, he told me I must not be discouraged to but if it so happened that I did not cross come back to his house and he would take me early next morning in time to the river that I might get to Byberry Meeting. I signified to him I would go to the river and wait for and opportunity to cross and if should fall out that I got over safe then I would look upon it as a good sign for me to think I was going [last word indecipherable]so biding him farewell</p>
<p>When I got to the river the ferryman said I was a lucky man to come just in the right time for good crossing.</p>
<p>I asked if he thought there was any such thing as luck. Getting into the boat we had a long discourse on what luck was when I reached Pennsylvania shore I gave him 25 cents for my ferriage bidding him farewell.</p>
<p>From here I walk up to Byberry and staid all night at my father-in-law's, not going to bed until I had inform them how I had crossed the river</p>
