                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical
                    Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce
                    E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021,
                    encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals
                    mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his
                    punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily
                    consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the
                    modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added
                    punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of
                    surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any
                    other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic
                    forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains
                    as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” And Hunt frequently used the
                    abbreviation “Do.” for ditto; this has not been changed. The word “sic” means
                    that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in
                    the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from
                    the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself
                    identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the
                    text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the
                    months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance,
                    is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the
                    texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again
                    for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was
                    at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or
                    travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety
                    of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.
