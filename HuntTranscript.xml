John Hunt: 
Dearly beloved cousin whom I often remember in the pure seed with secret strong desires thou with thy dear wife may be kept under the humbling hand and refining power of truth till the glory of his great work is finished and you know an enlargement of heart and opening of understanding in the heavenly mystery of his kingdom. With affectionate regard I salute you[r] little children,

[Right marginal note’s U T S A F W
Liverpool 1 Month 10, 1772.
John and Esther Hunt – My right dear and well beloved little cousins it is with feeling nearness and uniting regard I now salute you, desiring above all things you study obedience to the truth as it is manifested by the witness thereof not in any exalted notions of high imaginations but in the low valleys of deep humility where the secret mysteries is unsealed and the counsel and purpose of true wisdom respecting us open in a very intelligible manner, which as attended to with integrity and firmness strength is received a adequate for every trust reposed so as to come up in a faithful discharge of the same the reward whereof is peace and the running of rivers of joy by the fertile banks of Shiloh’s fountain where the soul drinks deep draughts and is refreshed grows strong being brought to the shepherds tents it feeds on heavenly bread and becomes well disciplined in its warfare as a good soldier is able to endure hardness and trials for truth’s cause. That this may be your happy experience dear children amidst all the crowding cares and cumbering concerns of a perishing world which fades as a flower and is seen no more it is with sweetness and satisfaction I often remember you and the pleasant moments we had together which length of time nor a distant land have not in the least diminished but rather increase the cordial notes of celestial converse in a language not easy to write with pen and ink but you I trust will be instructed in a school where you can read the characters of true friendship in other lines. I am with my dear companion well who joins in love which concludes me your very affectionate friend and cousin William Hunt
I give our very dear love to cousin Bobbe and wife. I should be glad to know if he went to Carolina also how he likes it. Salute Aaron Wills and his wife, cousin Samme Stokes and his wife, and others who ask for us. Farewell.
[Written sideways under this date]
This was the day I first gave up to say a few words in a public First Day meeting. In great diffidence, dread and fear a strong persuasion attended my mind that if I did give up to speak all and even my wife would detest and abhor me (which I believe was the works of the enemy) for I found it quite otherwise for my wife spoke comfortably and encouragingly and indeed I believe I needed it, for I was almost ready to sink so that some said they pitied me. But an healing peace followed of was such a reward of confirmation that I have thought since it never would be erased come on me what will or may, and this letter from my dear cousin I received when I came out of meeting which was an healing cordial to me. <note resp="transcr">The published version of Hunt’s Journal, 221-222, provides a slightly altered wording of this passage: This day, at our meeting, I first gave up to say a few words, I think, in great diffidence, dread and fear: a strong persuasion having attended my mind (which I since believe was the enemy's work) that if I did give up thus to expose myself in a public meeting, all would despise and abhor me, - even my bosom friend, and nearest connections: but I found it quite otherwise, for many of them, and especially , my wife, owned me in it, and spoke very comforting and encouragingly to me. The few words I had to communicate in that meeting were as follows: I believe it is needful, and would be profitable, when we are thus met together, diligently to watch against all such thoughts as we know ought not to have place in our minds. After I sat down, I felt such quietude, peace and composure, and a love that seemed to me to be new, that for some days I felt as if I had got into a new world. I loved not only my nearest connections, but all mankind, and even brutile creation, with a new love. This was such a confirmation of my being right, that I though it would never be erased, come on me what might. I felt as if I could turn my back on the world, and, if required, live like a hermit in the wilderness. Notwithstanding this confirmation of having been in my place at that time, I began to think that if ever it should be required of me again to say any thing in a public meeting, I should have a still more clear evidence of duty. Under this conclusion, I put off, and deferred speaking again for nearly a year; until I was in great danger of being quite bewildered on that hand. But as this kind of reasoning and false conclusion produced unsettlement, disquietude, and confusion of mind, so I found it safest to yield obedience to the clear manifestations of duty, without making a standard of my own.</note> </div>

She said she thought she could not be easy without mentioning a sympathy with some present who were under great exercise about laboring in the church. Said their labor though small might be of more service than they were aware of. Coming from such or such a one it might be like bread cast upon the waters that might be gathered after many days <note resp="transcr"> Ecclesiastes 11:1</note> , and mentioned something what a pity it would be if the Lord should be disappointed of his servants. It seemed to strike me having great reason to think it was for me.
After this meeting was over a committee appointed from our Monthly Meeting stayed to gather to consider the case of those children amongst us whose parents one had a right and the other none, who unanimously agreed that we ought to observe the words of the minute of the Yearly Meeting made in the year 1772.

<div type="entry" date="1774-07-17">17th of the Seventh Month, 1774. Went to our meeting a very P[oor] D[ull] H[eavy] T[ime] W[ith] Me. I found an account in the life of Thomas Story, page 221 and part in 224 as follows:
In the year 1699 many being taken away at Philadelphia by a pestilential fever then greatly prevalent ten being buried in one day and four died on the same several of them being good Friends. In page 224, he says my companion and I both remained in the town till the 23 of the month visiting the sick Friends from time to time as we found necessary or expedient, and great was the presence of the love of God with his people in the midst of this trying visitation which gave us occasion to say, good is the Lord and greatly to be feared, loved and obeyed for though he suffer afflictions to come upon his own chosen people in common with other men yet that which otherwise would be intolerable is made as nothing by how much sense the[re]of is swallowed up and immersed in his divine love, O the melting love! O the immortal sweetness I enjoyed with several as they lay under the exercise of the devouring evil, though unspeakably comforted in the Lord. Let my soul remember it and wit low before the Lord to the end of my days!
Great was the majesty and hound of the Lord! Great was the fear that fell upon all flesh! I saw no lofty or airy countenance; nor heard any vain jesting to move men to laughter; nor witty repartee, to raise mirth, nor extravagant feasting to excite the lusts and the desires of the flesh above measure: but every face gathered pal[e]ness and many hearts were humbled and countenances fallen and sunk as such that waited every moment to be summoned to the bar and numbered to the grave.
But the just appeared with open face and walked upright in the street and rejoiced in secret that perfect love that casteth out all fear and sang praises to him who liveth and reigneth and is worthy forever being resigned unto his holy will in all things, saying let it lie as thou will in time and in eternity now and forever. Nor love of the world nor fear of death could hinder their resignation, abridge their confidence or cloud their enjoyments in the Lord.
This companion of his died in Philadelphia with the fever.</div>

And it came so tight I was almost ready to wish I had never made any pretences to religion and I was somewhat disconsolate for several days but taking up a Bible one evening I opened on this verse: Let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil that shall not break my head, for yet my prayer also shall been in their calamities. Psalms the CXLI. 5th verse <note resp="transcr">Psalms 141:5</note> . I remembered the wounds of a friend are said to be faithful <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:6</note>  and that them that are loved ones are chastened. After this I thought I was favored to see that this testimony was a favor if rightly minded and my mind was settled under it, and I clearly saw that we stood in great need of it. Her testimony was very close against a worldly spirit. concerning many, nay she said all, was more or less deeply fettered and in the miry stiff clay and that our garments was spotted but that there was some that was endeavoring to have those spots washed out, but some she said was bound down to the world as with iron chains. I was favored to see there was need of getting deeper.</div>

He told us of the many favors and warnings we had had and that, whether we would choose or refuse, the Lord would have a people; that he would call others in if we refused; and that the day was dawned that would never be totally eclipsed and that the indignation and wrath of the Almighty would be poured out on this land in a great degree if the people did not return; and that God would be clear and his servants would be clear and our blood would be on our own heads and was very close and plain with the foremost ranks and in particular respecting carrying Monthly Meeting business on in their own strength and own wills and I think he hinted that it was too much the cases in general in our land and spoke of many that were wounded and some that were quite dead and reminded us of the many warning that we have had and threatenings of wars and times of trouble and trials times past and of the Indian wars and of the cruel oppression of the Negroes in the southern provinces and that their cries were as ascended to heaven and said an overflowing scourge would come if it did come. </div>

It was but a week before this time [12 of 12th month</note> that the people of Moorestown were, by reports, in full expectation of seeing the English army come in at the other end of the town; and I did expect it before meeting broke up.

<div type="entry" date="1777-01-19">19. We went to our meeting on First Day and there had a company of most distressed creatures. Lodged in our meeting house the night before and they were so distempered that the house smelt so bad (see Amos 4 and 10) wars stink of your camp etc. <note resp="transcr">Amos 4:10 "I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord</note> 
We could not bear it. It was littered and dirtied so that it was almost like a stable and the neighboring people told us that they [were] exceeding lowly and the people of Moorestown was very much distressed with these sort of people. At this time they told us that they were soldiers that were taken prisoners last spring amongst the English however they were taking them in wagons to Philadelphia and we were informed that they died so fast at Philadelphia that they dug great caves and buried a number together.
We kept a little meeting at Jacob Hollinshead’s and some friends went to Jacob Stokes’s and kept a little meeting. This day we heard of four burials at Mount Holly, viz. Elizabeth Burr daughter of Hannah Foster and died at William Foster’s, went there to her mother’s burial and was there taken sick and died; the other Samuel Swain’s wife; the other Samuel Burr; the other a soldier. 
Abundance of poor distressed soldiers wounded and prisoners were taken to Philadelphia about this time. I was lately [with] a man that said it was his business to dress the wounded at Burlington [and] that they had turned about sixty through there to a place ordered farther in Pennsylvania.</div>
<pb id="A0011518_053"/>
<div type="entry" date="1777-01-20">20th of the First Month, 1777. I went to Haddonfield to the burial of Edward Gibbs is wife. Joshua Evans spoke very well and several others. This day Nigah Peacock was buried, a very ingenious man in Evesham. He had since the wars began erected a powder mill and carried in on to considerable perfection till one day he was at work amongst his powder and by some means it catched fire and killed him and hurt several of his family. Besides it was said that the roof of the house was blown off and very much shattered to pieces with the blast of the powder; however the report of the powder was heard very heavy like a great cannon ten miles round. I really thought that it had been a cannon and I was about ten miles from the place. His powder catched fire once before and he narrowly escaped.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1777-01-22">22 First Month, 1777. I went with my friend Joshua Evans to see the poor Indians at Edgepelick and we found them in a very low circumstance as to food and raiment. Joshua took them a considerable parcel of old clothes with which the poor naked children seemed exceedingly pleased. Joshua had been under some concern for these poor creatures and proposed to them that if they could get some money he would try to get some blankets for them and so mentioned the case amongst his friends and collected a parcel of blankets for them (gratis) and so made them for pay for them at a moderate price and when he had got their money he laid it out in corn for them, not letting them know what he intended to do with their money till after he delivered the blankets, this he did because these poor things are too apt to lay out their money in strong drink. This visit to these poor creatures was an instructing lesson to me though they were so poor there seemed to be innocency unity quietude and peace amongst them at a time when it was much otherwise with the white people not only great rumors and confusions of wars but there was abundance of difference about roads at this time.
This visit was very satisfactory to me. We went to a run to drink and Joshua lay down on his belly to drink and I asked him if he had rather drink so than be served in a silver cup he answered much rather. We returned home with the increase of true satisfaction and peace, enlargement of hearth and fortitude of mind and tenderness, and it was much more agreeable to me to be with them than with the haughty and great. Amongst the elderly women there was countenances that bespoke gravity humility innocency and tranquility. There was one Indian woman that had a child just three weeks old that morning and she was so well that it seemed as if nothing had ailed her at all. This I could but remark because her cabin was so open- not so tight and warm as our stables are in common which, under consideration of the weakly ness of our women at such times, caused me to conclude that the more tenderly we kept and nursed ourselves and children the more tender and weakly we were.
[Right marginal note] And the weather very cold and no bed but a little straw and a few blankets and yet she seemed pretty cheerful though but a bushel of Indian Corn in the cabin and husband gone] 
Their children were all very healthy. This visit made me think how lavish we feed and pamper our bodies with corn whilst there are so needy, yet they on the whole as much if not more happy and content than we and as likely to answer the end of their creation as far as I know.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1777-01-23">23rd of the First Month, 1777. I went to Haddonfield meeting which was not so dull as some.

[Left marginal note] I have heard saying If the Lord [is] for us no [ma]tter who is against us <note resp="transcr">Romans 8:31</note> .
I have thought that if our minds were turned this way in true humility and resignation our innocent conduct and deportment would be our best advocate in the most trying season. Though our tongues were quite silent there would be a powerful language in our innocent conduct and deportment and this I believe would do more for us than the best prepared arguments of men’s invention.</div>

Memorandum 24th of the Twelfth Month, 1776.
[Left marginal note] See Jeremiah chapter 48 and 16 verse. Moab’s calamity is near and affliction hasteth fast
About this time things did work together in a strange manner. About the 15th of this Twelfth Month great fear fell on our neighborhood we being in full expectation of the English army down upon us so that there was great to do moving of goods and talk of hiding of earthly treasure and I suppose a great deal of that was done in many places, but things seemed to turn very strange and unexpected. About the 22 of the Twelfth Month the two armies met at Mount Holly and had a skirmish. The Americans were drove out of the town and came back to the Moorestown and by reports the Hessians or * the English party did strip many very much at that time in Mount Holly. See Jeremiah 15: 12 and 13: verse 14, See Jeremiah 11: 17: 19 and Genesis VI [or VII] and 11 and Isaiah 24:5, Jeremiah 11:34 verse. Maybe twenty years before this Mount Holly was a remarkably highly favored place. But there was an admirable strange turn, for as was reported about the 26 of the month a very stormy day some hundreds of the Hessians or of the English party were taken prisoners at Trenton and brought to Philadelphia and the rest drove back towards Brunswick.
[Left marginal note] * Read Deuteronomy 28 Chapter and 49:50:51 verses
And at this time there was a mournful work taking up several of the leading or active men some of one side and some of the other, too tedious to mention in particular. I was told that one Isaac Piercal was shot about this time who had been a justice of peace. Lives above Burlington. Some put in prison on suspicion of being party takers on one side and some on the other. See John Woolman’s book, page 174 and 175 and 176 and see Zephaniah 1: 17 and 18.
[Left marginal note] *See Jeremiah 51 and 46, Ruler against ruler etc
One thing at this time was very remarkable and pretty much noticed by the people. About the middle of the Second Month John Hay near Haddonfield got several men to join him and went to a Negro man's house with clubs and laid claim to and attempted to take away one of the Negro man’s sons, where upon a very great quarrel ensued and some very heavy blows passed between them. The Negro man got very much bruised. The Negro boy hid and they were forced to go away without him, a neighbor being called in the fray and stopped them, or it was thought that there was a danger of being murder done amongst them. The Negro man applied to authority to get satisfaction but the affair drop without a great deal to do.
But now about the middle of the Twelfth Month this [John] Hay was at Haddonfield at a tavern amongst the soldiers. A quarrel began and he in the fray got very much wounded being stabbed with bayonets in his belly so that at this time he is under the doctor’s hands, and no way expected to recover. He was favored to get up again after great illness.
See Zephaniah 11:3 Seek ye the Lord all ye meek of the Earth which have wrought his judgments. Such righteousness seek meekness it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.</div>

{1777-01}
<div type="entry" date="1777-01-22">About the 22nd of the First Month 1777 there was a very great commotion and troubles amongst us. People were afraid of traveling the great roads because of the soldiers. Six of our neighbors being taken up pressed and put in Burlington goal because they would not sign or associate with them. Some others did sign and so were sent home on conditions to return to them when called on. This was a very sore trying time with many in Evesham who had lived carelessly. Remember the inhabitants of Laish: see Jeremiah 15: 19: Let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them: 20 And I will make unto this people a fenced brazen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for I am with them to save thee and to deliver thee saith the Lord. About this time Mark Miller and Thomas Redman were put in Gloucester prison for reading an epistle from the Meeting for Sufferings held at Philadelphia dated the 20th of the Twelfth Month 1776. There was such reports and noise about pressing men that we seemed to expect to meet with the trial every day and every hour.
[Hunt returns to the events of January 22, 1777 in an entry following February 4, 1777.]</div>
<div type="entry" date="1777-01-26">26th of the First Month 1777. We went to our meeting and were told as we were going that the soldiers intended to be there to press men. The meeting was quiet. After meeting broke up we found them at the door and pressed that is two men in the road. One had a gun and bayonet fixed. They stopped some and Ordered and pressed them to meet them the next Fourth Day but let many pass without Interruption.
[Left marginal note] It is strange to this how hardened we seemed to get to these trials; great stupidity and lukewarmness yet prevailed
Yet this proved a very close trial to some of our neighboring women on account of their sons and husbands, there being much expectation of them being taken to prison or before some of the greatest Rulers.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1777-01-29">29. Many of our Friends of Chester met the captain who seemed very moderate. They not coming to any result adjourned to meet the next Seventh Day. Accordingly on Seventh Day of the 1 of the Second Month Friends that were pressed meet again, and one of them, J Lippincott, said he believed if they had not got together quietly in the meeting house it seemed to him they would have marched them off. Some that were obliged to go strove hard for it and used many hard words, however it did not seem to me the trial would be very hard that time though the noise and commotion was very great. The captain was very moderate to our friends. He and some of them went down to Haddonsfield to the governor and so our friends go released. Joseph Roberts his wagon was pressed and taken from the meeting house this day. See Amos 4 and 10.</div>
{1777-02}
<div type="entry" date="1777-02-02">2nd of the Second Month. We were favored with a good quiet meeting and people seemed a little Mixed up to Duty.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1777-02-04">4. I went with William Matlack and John Lippincott on some business enjoined us by the Monthly Meeting concerning manumitting Negroes. At some places we had tight work of it though not rough this day. We were favored and come of with great encouragement beyond expectation.

<div type="entry" date="1777-02-22">22nd of the First Month above mention.

This by account was a very close sifting time with them. Some were cleared on examination by pleading infirmity which they had been subject to. I was told they look as if they had had a fit of sickness. [<italic>Notes and Observations</italic> inserts here on page 105: "I was told some of them when they came back looked as if they had had a fit of sickness.] Inquire of some of them when they came back I was told that J.

[Right marginal note] though wild youth
About that time the press company went about there was several very comical occurrences. To relate in full would seem more jocose than serious. People being in great fear took frights when there was no occasion and so false alarms were raised which flew so fast they could not be stopped till they spread several miles in a neighborhood, and some things a little remarkable happened to some young men that fled to get out of this trouble met with losses and returned home.
[Left marginal note] This was a very trying season to many that was forced to leave their families in a very sorrowful manner. I was told of one that quite sweat with fear.

Joshua I thought had very acceptable service amongst them and there was something very tendering amongst us. At last we parted with our Friends in near unity and true love, and some of them seemed not willing to part with us so we lodged at Joseph Buzby’s and dine at Aaron Willis’s. We called to see Joseph Hackney concerning manumitting his Negroes, at first or prospect of doing any good was very discouraging, yet things worked together encouragingly after a while, we had a very full opportunity with them first and then had the Negroes called into the room and had a good deal to say to them all which seemed to end well and we parted in a much more unity love and nearness than we met.

Abel was very notable he said it was often his lot to go down to Jordan that he might be made sensible of his own weakness and ignorance in divine things. Peace be with you was some of his first words and he did speak very extraordinary on the subject. He said the peace of God is like a white stone which John saw and in it a new name was written which none knew but him that had it and like the goodly pearl that the wise merchantman sought which when he found sold all to purchase it <note resp="transcr">Matthew 13:46</note> . So ought we to do sell (or) that is part with all for it, that there is none of this peace for the wicked. That his servants was not to have this peace if they disobeyed the secret reproofs of instruction: which is the way to life. I perceived Abel had much advanced in the ministry I having made some memorandum of his being at our meeting several years (maybe six) ago. The meeting to me was very dark and dull his companion also spoke very notably.</div>

In the forepart of his illness he seemed very desirous to live longer but about this time he was in great distress and brought very low he seemed to give up and said he was willing to die and told his mother not be troubled about him and said maybe it was best for him to suffer and said his must be done and that he was willing either to die or to live. His younger brother stood by when he expressed these words, and he spoke to him and told him he should be a good boy. Maybe thee will be sick again said he one evening. He asked his mother if she thought he would get well again She told him she hoped he would be better of than any of us if he did not get well again he answered thee don’t know that and said he thought he should be a better boy as he did he well. He said further if he did get well again he should love to go to meeting and that he always did love to go to meeting. He said one day when he was in great distress he wished he had a had *Michael * Shion

to go to a school to always when he came to give up and said he was willing to die he said I never could give up to be willing to die till now and now I am willing either to die or to live. Maybe I shall get better and so he did begin to mend from that time or nearly then abouts. He was I believe much favored that evening both inwardly and outwardly for after having been in very distressed restless condition near week after the fever left him pretty much he was raised up in his bed but being weak he throwed his face down on his knees like and there lay doubled up and said he was quite easy. That was the night he spoke to us and from that time I think he began to grow better slowly.</div>

Keeping a poor neighbor move about this time there came a very smart frost which seemed to cut off the prospect of our having any fruit this year and some that the rye is much hurt where it was forward. There was a vast great prospect of a fruit yield from the blossoms of every kind till now, but now the trees looked as if the had been scorched with the fire they were so niped with the frost. I thought it might be a lesson to us and compared it a little thus a deal of talk of religion and high profession like drawing nigh with the mouth and the lips whilst the heart was far from what it should be, so but little fruit by reason of coldness and lukewarmness.</div>

He was a poor lad of but little account when he moved from us and about six or seven years ago. I heard but a poor account of his conduct but now he is become an able minister. At Evesham he spoke very notably. Mark Reeve was there and several others and it seemed to me it might be a pretty good meeting to some though it was not very lively to me.

<div type="entry" date="1777-05-09">9th of the Fifth Month. Thomas Saint was at our meeting. Mark Reeve, George Dillwyn (and Robert Willis dropped in but was silent). As I went to this meeting I seemed almost wearied out with the besetments of the Enemy, but almost as soon as I sat down there was a breathing desire begotten for help and a broken heart and a better spirit prevailed and I believe George Dillwyn had a near sympathy with me for he presently got up and spoke exactly to my condition which was as much as I could well bear. He spoke in so sweet and so sympathizing a manner and so encouraging. G[eorge] D[illwyn’s]:W[ords]: Teach me O thou whom my soul loveth where thou leads thy flock <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 1:7</note> .
Thomas Saint spoke next and very notably concerning that master self and other subjects then Mark Reeve spoke and George Dillwyn concluded the meeting with a very extraordinary prayer and a most glorious meeting it was I believe to many. I thought I had not seen the power of Truth so much in dominion amongst the people a long time as for me I seemed almost as if I was transported into another country.</div>

He drew his discourse from the words of the prophet where it is mentioned that though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither fruit be in the vine, the flocks should be cut off from the fold and there should be no herd in the stable and the field should yield no meat, yet would he rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of his salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3: 17-18</note>  and that the rod that was lifted up over this land would not be withdrawn till the inhabitants were made to bow under it: that he had seen in the vision that the had that it had been with him to threaten with famine with blasting and with mildew.</div>

Some of the foremost rank spoke very discouraging* but at length a small number of friends was appointed to attend the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting and they went down to the ferry but could not get over the boats being all sent away to prevent any passing and dreadful work at this time there was pressing of wagons and horses many Friends having their wagon and horses pressed and taken from them to carry off stores etc. Such doing as this made many afraid to travel the great roads and so private roads were sought for and some traveled by night for fear of being pressed.

After meeting a soldier or officer came amongst the people to press wagons. Several pleaded with him and got off safe with their wagons that time but at Haddonfield Friends’ wagons and horses were pressed almost every meeting day about this time yet did indifferency and lukewarmness too much prevail. See Amos 4:10 verse: I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword and I have taken away your horses and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils yet have ye not returned unto me saith the Lord.

Just as we were ready to set off to meeting there came a man and asked if we would take in or entertain a family that was afraid of being taken by the Hessian army which were at Haddonfield and it was said were going to Moorestown. I thought best to leave them at their liberty. The man went back and immediately the family came, that is a man and his wife and two children the woman and one of the children were crying and surprised. The woman persuaded us not to go to meeting but I felt most easy to go.
[Left marginal note] The Hessians were at Haddonfield and stripped some very much of their provision at this time
When we came to Moorestown there was a great uproar. The people expected the Hessians every hour. When the meeting had been gathered a little while there was a great uproar and noise in the street and outcry that they were coming. A man came to the meeting house door and called out a Friend and said they would be here in five minutes time: whereupon some Friends went out and went home but the most part were favored to sit still. There was a constant roaring of cannon all this while every one of which guard the house but at last came one that even shook ** the walls very much and very much surprised the people. Women turned pale and began to cry but sat still and seemed to get over the shock these cannon seemed so hard I thought it was likely they were in the lower end of the town which was the more dreadful when we came out of meeting all seemed still and quiet and we found it was a false alarm there was no Hessians nearer than Haddonfield.

The Committee appointed to reconsider the method of Dealing with those that go out in their Marriage, having mostly met on the occasion with several other members both men and women  and having Duly considered the rules of our Discipline respecting that Transcription and the Sentiments of friends being freely Expressed, it is our sense and judgment, that our Discipline clearly points out, that such offenders should be treated with before they are fully set aside unless they have been precautioned before, and that where the Labor of love Extended to such, has the Desired Effect to convince them of the weight of their Transgression and is manifested by due Circumspection of Life and Conversation, and that meetings are sensible of the sincerity of the offenders, acknowledgments from such may be Excepted. But where there does not appear those torid[?] marks of Contrition, after such Labor as above said, that meetings speedily proceed to Disown them. which nevertheless is submitted to the meeting, signed this 20th of the 4th Month 1778. By Edmund Hollinshead, Joshua Roberts, John Lippincott, John Hunt, William Matlack, Enoch Roberts, Samuel Shute, William Foster, Thomas.

<div type="entry" date="1778-05-14">14. I went to our weekday meeting. John Simpson was there from Pennsylvania, a man I had some knowledge of some years though much a stranger amongst us he spoke very extraordinary I thought to the state of our meeting. Some of his words was concerning Herod who had slain the children. This he compared to a worldly spirit and said, O how glad would I have been to have heard Rachel’s voice amongst you, this he compared to the true church that was mourning for the slain of the daughters of her people. Leah was tender eyed; this he compared to the winking and too lightly looking over faults in our children, but beautiful Rachel was more beloved by her husband and she mourned [?] because her children are not coming and growing up in the right way. <note resp="transcr">Matthew 2:18?</note>  This man I did think at the right end of the work he mentioned something of keeping up the morning and evening Sacrifices. I was now confined pretty much at home.

<div type="entry" date="1778-05-24">24. Was First Day. I went to our meeting. After this meeting I was under some uneasiness of mind but in a few days it was clear off and I believed it was only the suggestions and buffeting of Satan.</div>

Mark Reeve and his wife and Phillip Dennis and Ebenezer Miller and James Cooper was there, these Friends was appointed to attend our Monthly Meeting from the Quarterly according to the direction of the Yearly Meeting. These Friends had a great deal to say and a very searching striping time it was. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, June 1778. "Most of the said Quarter Committee appointed in the work of reformation attended this meeting and signified that they had freedom to propose having a meeting of conference on that occasion at this place tomorrow and at Chester on seventh Day next which was fully approved of, and the friends present are desired to give notice to those members that are absent."</note>

They were at our First Day meeting and I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting when I had got about a mile from home I met some friends a coming back who told several of us that the English army was about a mile on the road and coming this way, which seemed something surprising to all of us and a pretty close trial to us to leave our families at such a time. After some discourse we seemed to take courage and fear went of and all set off together, the report being so straight and from such a one,* 
[Left marginal note]* W. F.
that we could not expect any other but that we should go immediately amongst them. However, we had not gone far before we met some soldiers, but they were not English. They behaved very civil and let us pass peaceably and we passed several other companies of soldiers but had not interruption but had a quiet good meeting.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1778-06-11">11. I went to our meeting. Enoch Roberts and Agnes Hewlings was married. Thomas Evans was there and spoke very much to my state which seemed very strange. His word was concerning raggedness and nakedness and robes of righteousness. About this time I was taken very poorly with inward fever. I continued very poorly about ten days and then got a little better my wife was very bad about this time.

<div type="entry" date="1778-06-18:19:20">About the 18:19 and 20 the British army marched up from Philadelphia through the Jerseys. Some part went up through Evesham and past through Moorestown and a most dismal time of trial and stripping it was, they plundering the houses and stripping away horses and creatures of every sort in a most dismal manner. Some families were most exceedingly stripped and some fared much better than they could expect. To be particular in this relation would be too extensive a work for me, yet this much I remark that in this dismal storm or shower there was but very few lives lost down this way. Only one that we were certain of and two houses burned down in Evesham. In this dreadful time we were favored for they came not to our house though they were all round amongst our neighbors, except a very few of our neighbors escaped their company. 
The 20 they were at Moorestown and we expected they would come every hour and at last there came three, and then we expected to be stripped and plundered as many of our near neighbors were but they were three deserters and behaved very well.
I put a new piece in A. Ashead’s pump and mended several others.</div>

The storm, however dreadful whilst it was over our heads, seemed to not have any good effect on the people. Now the armies of all sorts being gone away to the eastward, market opened again and people fell on to trading and struggling after the treasures of the earth.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1778-07-26">26. We having been getting in harvest and hay etc. nothing very neetesh unless it was this it was a very poor low discouraging time with me as to the state of my mind the heavens seemed as brass and the earth as iron.

This 26 of the Seventh Month, 1778, I went to our meeting. Robert Willis and John Parrish was there. Robert at last had a very lively testimony and John spoke too and the meeting seemed to end well. After meeting I went with these Friends to Joseph Stokes to dine and so to John Lippincott’s, he being very unwell and some of the children with the flux we had a little sitting and John and Robert both spoke very extraordinary. In the evening they came home with me to lodge and I was very glad of their company.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1778-07-27">The 27 before they went away we had a little time of silence and John spoke very well to the poor state of my mind and to our children and servants—this week we were about hay.</div>

Abraham Griffe and his companion from Pennsylvania was there and William Jones but were almost silent in the first meeting but the last seemed to end well and afforded some satisfaction to my mind. The 7th was our youth’s meeting at Moorestown which was very large. Abraham Griffe, William Jones, and Robert Willis, Samuel Hopkins, and John Reeve and several others was there. Abraham spoke first in a very affecting manner but at length Robert appeared [marginal note: Several small testimonies before him.] and had I think the most lively testimony that I ever had heard [from] him and a blessed highly favored meeting it was to me and I believe pretty generally so to others. In his speaking he mentioned the many troubles. And trials that were to be met with in this world and that a great part fell to the righteous, but yet at times they were greatly favored supported and carried through and said we must take the rough with the smooth, the winter with the summer, but he would have us set our faces like a flint to cut through the ice, the frost, and the snow, and told us the zeal of some friends in Old England that came three hundred miles on foot to a yearly meeting and some upwards and of some in New England that traveled on foot thirty miles to a meeting and carried their children and victuals in a wallet and about halfway there in spring between Pebrook and Sadsbury where they used to stop and drink which goes by the name of the Quaker’s Spring to this day for ought I know, says he, this was a fine opportunity.

Second day 28th I set off to Philadelphia to the Yearly Meeting with my brother Robert from Maryland. I went to the Bank meeting house where there was many solid good Friends and several testimonies was delivered. One Friend said he had (or thought he had) distinctly heard the sound of the want of bread as he walked the streets, in the next meeting at Market Street there was some very able ministers appeared. One ancient woman had something by way of a prophecy a little. She said, as near as I remember, there would be turnings and great overturnings yet in the land many houses would be left desolate great and fair without inhabitants* 
[Left marginal note] It did prove so. Many famous houses were burnt down by soldiers.
I attend the several sittings of this Yearly Meeting meeting till the last about one on Seventh Day in which the general active part of Friends expressed that it was a highly favored meeting. One day the forepart of the week three women came into the men’s meeting and sat some time and seemed to be under a very great and exceeding deep concern and at last one stood up and I think delivered As lively a testimony as I ever heard. It seemed to be chiefly against a forward spirit that would be willing to be seen in carry on the affairs of the church could it head knowledge worldly wisdom and said though the words might seem well their spirits was against the truth,* Reminded us of the man that went to stretch forth his hand to steady the ark and was struck dead. The next day but one, there came one woman and so odd an one that there was much talk of here and many went to see her at her chamber which she but seldom left. She came into the men’s meeting and appeared in a very solid deep exercise as she stood a considerable time on the steps between the gallares. At last begun to speak very loud and zealous. Expressed the sense she had of the great favors with which Friends were favored at that time and was of the mind if there was a general turning to the Lord in faithfulness that Friends would get to be favored: but if they were not steady in faithfulness what we had seen was but the beginning of a sorrows: though it was a time of great poverty with me as to the inwards state of my mind, yet I believed it would be a time of very great instruction to me and many sentences be as bread cast on the waters.
[Left marginal note]* This seemed to be for some of the form of R[indecipherable] and I thought it seemed to appear who they were before the week was out: this was Mary Husbands with whom I had further acquaintance now in 1789 at Baltimore</div>

<div type="entry" date="1778-10-13">The 13 I went to the ferry to take my brother and his wife and children, who were setting off homewards to Maryland and I parted with them in tenderness and sympathy. And I came back a poor man asked if he might ride with me. I bid him jump in. He informed me he was a cooper and was soon to making casks at Mount Holly to hold cider and whisky, which led us into a discourse concerning the excessive use of strong drink. He related a case which was very entertaining, which was nearly thus: 
He said he lived with a rich man that was very much given to strong drink and very passionate and he had an old Negro that was so bad for drink that he could not manage him and so sold him to one Parson Stirgin. He still continuing very bad for drink and very troublesome, Stirgin sold him to a captain of a vessel who took him to sea where he suffered very hard usage by the drunken sailors. After some time he was brought into Philadelphia again and went to his old master and walked about the yard very sorrowful they asked him what was the matter with him and he told them he wanted his old master to buy him again and take him away from the bad sailors. They told him he would get drunk again and be troublesome. He said no he would never drink no more that cursed stuff. So his old master bought him again and he remained faithful to his promise 17 or 18 years, refusing to eat meat or touch one drop of strong drink and when they asked his reason why he would not eat meat and take a little strong drink he put his hand on his breast and said it was the Spirit told him. So one day his master fell into a rage and threw large stones at him. He said to his master, Ay you no kile me you nok au my brains out. You no kile me. I live for all dat after I Dad. You never make au a good Spirit, you never live after you dad. 
One day some rude boys thought they would have some fun with him and so got and put some rum in his can amongst his water unbeknown to him, but he threw it out with abhorrence and came and sat it down and told them to chop it to pieces for it stunk and said he would never use it anymore and so went and threw it in the fire and burnt it up. He also took the stone home with him and showed it to a Methodist minister who used his master house frequently, and told him how his master threw such as that at him which his master threw at him. This seemed to be done to show him how inconsistent it was to what they so highly professed. His master being a cooper by trade, poor women used to come to the shop for chips and when the journeymen and apprentices would drive them away and say they should not have any without they would bring them some rums this old Negro would say, “How can you drive au dat poor woman away?” and so would go and give them some. When he left off drinking he grew saving and when he died he left between 60 and 70 pounds in his chest.
[Left marginal note] When he reformed he became so noted that people used to stop him the the streets to talk with him.</div>

			Humility the Spring of Virtue is
			Humbling thy Self Virtue thou cannot Miss,
			Delight in Virtue, Vice be sure to Shun
			He’s happy, that a Virtuous Course doth run.
Also in the same book I found some lines of one Samuel Hunt of Nottingham. Before his departure he dictated the following: To live in the love and fear of God and if thou meet with any disappointment, thou mayst apply thyself to him, the more freely for assistance, it being thy father’s daily practice, in what exercise he hath met in this world and be truly honest, both towards God and man; always laboring in thy own mind to contradict anything that may be otherwise. I recommend this practice: privately to go into thy chamber twice a day to wait upon the Lord for council and instruction in all things and it is thy father’s desire that thou mayst be loving and dutiful unto thy mother, and loving and kind to thy wife.

Then Benjamin Reeve spoke. George Dillwyn appeared in prayer in a very lively manner and then stood up and spoke to a state very particular that had gone so far as to know what it was to have a good meeting, but was sat down at ease. Samuel Emlen concluded the meeting at last and his testimony was much to the same state some of his words was thus: Gallio* careth not for these things.

Now as to the wars and commotion here away we have enjoyed much quiet a considerable time, But there was an alarm of another kind as much if not more awful to some and that was an uncommon kind of a worm which bred in the grain of the wheat, which eat out and turned to a fly and they were so far multiplied about Salem that their bread was generally very much hurt with it and we heard it was a great deal worse in many places back in Virginia and Pennsylvania and Maryland and to the Southward and by reports in some parts where it was very bad. People that handled the wheat broke out with very bad sores and it was said people that handled such as millers where it very bad died with it so that it seemed as if it was an infectious and carried something of the appearance of a famine and a kind of a pestilence.</div>

Our little son Bille was very ill at this time with a stoppage of the stomach and shortness of breath with which he was exceedingly distressed and the 15 about one o’clock at night he departed this life crying out in his distress, Daddy O what I shall do. What I shall do?, this was often his cry, “Daddy, what I shall do?”, which was very affecting and indeed something very solemn and awful attended this language from such a child. He was always a very healthy fine child till this spell of sickness, which I believe was what is called the hives. He was born the 11 of the First month 1776 and departed this life the 15th of the Twelfth Month 1778. He remained sensible till less than an hour before he died, calling “Daddy” as long as he had strength and was buried the 17th. Joshua Evans was at the burial and at the meeting, It being our weekday meeting. Rebekah Roberts spoke. Her words was something concerning going to the house of mourning, that it was better than to go to the house of feasting and expressed a sympathy with some that was and had been willing to Dwell as it were in the house of mourning and encouraged them to be patient until it should pleased the Lord to arise for their help and bring them forward.

<div type="entry" date="1778-12-27">27 of the Twelfth Month, 1778. I went to Haddonfield meeting a very cold day it was and a great snow on the ground. Mary Sweet and Sarah Hopkins spoke but the meeting was poor and things looked cold as to religion after meeting I went home with Benjamin Swett and Joshua Evans was with us: Joshua Evans having had a concern to pay the Indians at Edgepelick and some white people at Goshen a religious visit had asked me to go with him and Benjamin Swett expressing a freedom to join in the visit. Now after having the approbation of our Friends of our Monthly Meetings we now conclude to proceed and went as far as our kind friend Isaac Borton’s this evening.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1778-12-28">28. This morning after breakfast Benjamin and Joshua had some kind and tender advice to drop and then we proceeded to Goshen mill and had a meeting with some not of our profession: with which they seemed well pleased and asked us to come and see them again when the weather should be more moderate. Here we lodged and had good quarters and very kind entertainment. Next morning at parting we had a pretty deal to say but it was chiefly to two young women that was there towards whom all our minds seemed sympathisingly drawn.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1778-12-29">29. Then we went forward to see the Indians and endeavored to have them collected together which seemed rather difficult by reason of the severity of the weather and great snow, however I believe the greater part did get together at one of their Indian houses and had a meeting with them which seemed very open and I believe ended well, yet as there was some elderly people and some lame and some not very well in health and some children that could not get there, we seemed not clear without visiting them in their private families. This night we lodged at an Indian house but a Dutchman had got live in it. Here we met with haridsh fare to what we had been used to, yet were far from complaining and bore it cheerfully having each one a blanket with us we lay by the fire and did very well.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1778-12-30">Next Day 30. we proceeded to visit the families and very extraordinary open sitting we had in which I believe that we were truly owned. The last held till after dark and was I believe to general satisfaction. Some of the Indians were very tender and all seemed very attentive. Now we seemed to be released and parted with the Indians seemingly with great respect and rode down to our friend Isaac Borton’s which was about eleven or twelve miles. In some part of this visit at times I was stripped very much and left very poor, yet in the end I found an increase of true peace and stability and fortitude of mind. In this visit we seemed most easy not to take any provision with us and* so partook with the Indians of their bread.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1778-12-31">31. I parted with my friends Joshua and Benjamin very glad and set after them. A heart tendering time it was to me.</div>

I believed there was room for a more extensive care in them particulars but some of our elders seemed as if they could not bear to hear it and it passed it did not end quite pleasant. This night I had a dream which was thus: I thought I was at or near our meeting house with some of our younger Friends that seemed to be coming forward: John Collins was one in particular and I thought we were looking in our Bibles and I thought John spoke pretty lively and zealous but could not remember what he said, but my book I thought had a blot in it and I thought I got pretty much displeased and walked a little away from the others but we seemed to get together again and when we parted I thought John Collins said: (and it seemed as if it was to rectify a little misunderstanding amongst us) read the seventh of Micah. I being awoke by my wife getting up to go to market and had a mind to see if there was such a chapter for I question if there was so many in that book but found there was and I thought the contents of it remarkable at that times.

This evening I went with these Friends some to William Rogers’s and some to Edward Darling’s etc.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-03-22">22. According to appointment Friends generally met at Evesham Meeting for worship was but indifferent but in the conference I think truth was over all that it met with opposition and there was something very close and tight amongst the foremost rank. Warner Mifflin bore a very full plain clear and lively testimony against Friends taking Congress money, which some could hardly bear with, yet I believe the meeting was very edifying to many. This evening, Benjamin Haugh and William Lambert and Joshua Evans came home with me, which was a satisfaction to have their company.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-03-23">23. We went to Haddonfield meeting which was quite silent in the time of Worship but the last meeting was very extraordinary and very edifying to many I believe.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-03-24">24. These Friends went forward as meetings were laid out to Woodbury and a most violent storm of snow there was at this time though we have had fine warm weather several weeks together before, so that it was brought the fruit trees uncommonly forward.

John Reeve spoke very excellent concerning the power of God to as many as believed he gave power to become the sons of God etc. His was a very good meeting. Upon the whole I think though there was something close amongst the foremost rank concerning omitting that part of our queries concerning defrauding the king of his duty, which some were for omitting but Pennsylvania friends were united in it that it should not be dropped without the consent of the Yearly Meeting and there was very close work with them about it but Truth I think gained ground this day.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1779-04-09">9. I was about home at sundry small matters sowing some flax and at work at a lye tub for my wife etc. Several things remarkable one was this: a young woman being newly married was persuaded by her husband to be inoculated for the small pox and gave way to it and had it very bad in her illness. She much reflecting upon herself for bringing that disorder on her but after some time she told them about her that she fond hopes for forgiveness but said her life would be taken for her transgression and died accordingly. This he had from Isaac Evans a very notable Friend. The other was concerning the use of buckles. Some Friends in Carolina shewed some scruples concerning buckles coming a fashion amongst them but one very notable public Friend rather spoke for them and rather bore against them that shewed some doubts. Some little time afterwards as he, Zacharias Dicks, was sitting in a meeting quite still one of his buckles broke to pieces and flew about the floor and after that he took to wearing strings.

[Journal Ninth Month (September) 1779
This memorandum was loose and did not appear to have been ever bound in this section]</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-09-25">25th of the 9th month 1779. I went down to Philadelphia, the Yearly Meetings Committee and Quarterly Meetings Committee and the Monthly Meetings Committee had appointed to meet at 4 o’clock to consider of the work to which they were appointed concerning the Reformation. Divers Friends gave in their account that they had visited most parts and that they believed there was some stirrings of life in most places but that things were at a very low ebb in many places. Anthony Benezet expressed a concern that he had concerning some customs that had prevailed amongst the youth and the neglect of the foremost rank. This was close and smartly handled. Friends seemed to conclude that we had but got to the door of this work all which was very confirming to me. Then Committee adjourned to meet 3rd day evening at 6:o clock.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-09-26">Fourth day 26 We went to the Market Street Meeting in the morning. James Thornton, George Dillwyn and divers others spoke very noteable. At half after 2 Meeting begun at the same place. A Friend from New England spoke with many others. Met again at 6th hour this evening. A woman Friend seemed rather more than common concerned that the foremost rank might keep among their watch. James T[hornton] and G[eorge] Dilw[yn]’s subject was somewhat on love and unity and being tender of one another in these times in which so much envy and division prevailed in our land. The stranger from N[ew] E[ngland] words was something concerning keeping our garments clean from the spots of blood. It seemed to be the mind of divers Friends that the Lord would raise up Judges as at the first and Counselors as in the beginning.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-09-27">27. I went to Market Street Meeting and there was something pretty lively. I remarks G[eorge] D[illwyn] w[o]rds Remember Rock from which you were hewn and hole of the pit from whence you were diged. Began business ths afternoon. A Stranger opened the Meeting very extraordinary his words was the Center shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from Israel until Shiloh come. At the close of the Meeting a New England Friend spoke very extraordinary concerning children of Israel how they were brought out bondage and brought it along Down to our Friends in the beging they had purchased our liberty by their sufferings and something of the deviations in many reports but that in most places where he had been there was something fresh and lovely, but this was the grief and sorrow of the heart and he mentioned it as a caution that the elderly sort stood in the way of the rising generation . This was very confirming in my mind. This to see so large a number of lively Friends and to see the advantages of the Truthful raised in me strong desires that I and my house might be preserved in the land of the living. </div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-09-28">28 at 8th hour. Met again and minutes of the Meeting for Sufferings was read which gave account of many instances of Friends suffering and their faithfulness therein which had been very great in many places also the epistles from many different quarters of the world came to this our Yearly Meeting notwithstanding the great commotion and confusion that prevailed in the earth which contained much very seasonable advice and council. There was Friends [last two lines indecipherable].</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-09-28">28. Friends assembled at half past 2 and a very lively setting it was. Friends went into divers appointment of committees for different services and adjourned to next day. This evening the Committee on the Reformation met again at 6 and a very instructing edifying time it was to me worthy of remembering Thomas Ross his words in particular; concerning enlarging the house mentioned the passage when the man went to fall a beam and his axe came off and fell in the water. This I never heard so explained before and many more very excellent remarks was made worthy to be remembered and improved upon.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-09-29">29. Met again at the 10th hour. Several Friends from New England and that way introduced minutes form their several meetings showing their desire to attend this Yearly Meeting with their Friends approbation therewith which was an example of a lively zeal. William Brown mentioned an account of an English Friend that said he had attended their Yearly Meeting 42 years and missed but twice and said that if he had never met with satisfaction til then he had then enough to satisfy for all his trouble a full reward. And Robert Willis said he knew some Friends in England come three hundred miles to the Yearly Meeting on foot a half a dozen together. After reading the minutes of last year and appointing several committees in services and divers very lively and suitable remarks being made and George Dillwyn had appeared in prayer the meeting adjourned til the 3 hour this afternoon. At this setting the Yearly Meeting Committee gave in their report of their service concerning the Reformation which was that the thing very low in many places yet there was on the whole some considerable progress and comfortable prospects. The case of schools was included in this.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-09-03">3rd hour. Friends met again the request from several Quarterly Meetings were now read and that from Chester Quarter entered upon concerning our testimony against war. This appeared to be a weighty matter and some of the tightest work I have ever seen. There was a number of Friends that appeared exceeding zealous for to stand clear and for the exaltation of our testimony and a number that was afraid of going too fast and a very long clost conference was held at length the matter was committed to a committee, then adjudged to meet next day: 30 at 2 clock. Met again but there was a meeting for worship this morning. Samuel Wilson John Sanders and George Dillwyn all spoke very pertinent to the times and very large and lively and this was the most solid and lively meeting as yet this afternoon. Met at on business the case of such who mary too near of kin was before this setting and many very suitable remarks were made much to my satisfaction. This was a fine day with us and there was something very uniting amongst us, edifying strengthening and comforting. Adjourned.</div>
{1779-10}
<div type="entry" date="1779-10-01">1st 10 month. At 11. Went to Anthony Benezet’s this evening and there was a number of choice Friends. The love and sweetness that appeared amongst them was very inviting. Anthony gave me some books to distribute. </div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-10-02">2: Assembled again at 11th hour. The case of a Negro’s affair was before the Meeting and closely handled the with great consideration. Many very extraordinary sentences was dropped. Adjourned to the 3rd hour this afternoon then accordingly met the case of Reformation to consider what was further was before the Meeting. A lively solid time it was and I am satisfied it was very edifying and strengthening to many. Many very pertinent remarks was made. Adjourned [page missing] day.
Met again 10th hour 2nd 10 month. Again assembled the case concerning attending Meeting was before the Meeting and concerning drowsiness was exceeding deeply spoke to. A case from New England concerning a meetinghouse cellar [or seller] and a case concerning taxes etc. in this setting. I that Light seemed to break forth and clouds began to move this was a setting in which I that there was great instructio to be gathered in some matters in F H B M D. Met again at 3 o'clock. The state of the Society as it came represented in the Queries was before the Meeting and such a day as this I had never yet seen. The many exceeding deep pertinent and wise remarks was I believe wonderful and greatly encouraging to many the trumpet was sounded, the people lifting, and an army rising up to battle which afforded great encouragement to list. </div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-10-03">On 1st day the 3rd of the month I went to the Bank meeting house. Jacob Lindley spoke very lively. And Thomas Woodward and Joseph Brown and a fine lively meeting it was. I went to dine at Thomas Hough’s Rem. This time in the afternoon I went to the Hill Meeting. Nicholas Wall appeared and divers others. In the evening I was at Market Street Meeting. Samuel Wilson spoke very large. A Friend from New England and Samuel Emlen all spoke. These were very lively meetings. Samuel Emlen’s words was remarkable as it fell out he signified that there was some there that were great and high in the World that were near their latter end that Death was nearly approaching toward them very closely.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1779-10-04">On 2nd day the 4th of 10 month the 8th hour Friends again assembled their epistles from the divers Yearly Meetings on our com[indecipherable] to wit: New England Long Island Maryland Virginia North and South Carolina and London were again read and answers to them. To each particular Yearly Meeting were produced and agreed to be sent. Likewise a request from Western Quarter to consider of the consequence of circulating of the Continental money. This was very clost work but I believe the conference and the conclusion was in wisdom’s line. Many very excellent hints were dropped which I believe will be useful. Friends were above all things advised to be careful how they got over the tender scruples in their own minds in these respects and to be very careful how censored one another but to dwell in a spirit of charity and sympathy which would unite. After the minutes were read there was a solid pause and the New England Friends took their leave of us in a very sweet and commendable manner dropping short testimonies against pride and superfluity in dress and household furniture and a very particularly to be careful on all hands not to trample on one another’s tender scruples. This was closely fixed on the elderly sort and these who seemed to have tender scruples were closely cautioned of too much zeal and to wait n the patience be wisely to suffer and at last be careful that we fall not out by the way. There was a solemn setting ended in a very solid frame and I believe Friends were greatly united and comforted to gather as many did expressed and as by their conduct and deportment appeared then the Meeting adjourned till next year. And although we had been favored with such a fine opportunity every way. About two hours after Meeting broke up there was a very smart firing of guns and a dreadful uproar in the Town and the cry was they are killing one another which proved to be true and a very great uproar there was in the Town and [page missing] said that a mob had laid hands on divers Friends.

<div type="entry" date="1779-11-07">7th. [sic.] [9th] Brother Aaron Wills and his wife was here and a satisfactory opportunity it was in conversation two things was remarkable, one concerning a man given to strong drink which was related by a New England Friend who was at our last Yearly Meeting which was thus:
A man in their parts of a considerable extensive capacity and so very capable and serviceable amongst Friends, but giving way to strong drink Friends were necessitated to disown him after which he reformed from it entirely and was reinstated amongst his friends again and restored to his former service amongst them. After some time, he loving cider very well thought he might eat it as spoon victuals. So beginning to make use of it by little and little, he gave way to use it to excess again till Friends were under a necessity to testify against him again, after some time he fell into a heavy fit of sickness in which he had a remarkable dream which was thus. He thought there came a pretty little dog to him and fondled on him and he was standing on the head of a pair of stairs that led into a cellar and the little dog took hold of the shirt of his coat and pulled him down one of them steps. He said he could have went up again and have drove away the little dog but still delight in him and let him pull him by the coat. And he pulled him down one of them steps after another till he got him to the last and even then he thought he could have Drove away the dog and went up again but he still delighting in and indulging the dog and went up till he pulled him off the last step to a place where there was no bottom and he died in that sickness.

The 10th of the Twelfth Month last, at our Monthly Meeting the time it held two days and a large number of strangers was there and a lively opportunity; it was proposed by B. Hough to alter our custom of having the couples pass in the forepart of the meeting. I having unity with the proposal urged for the alteration and it was then agreed to by the said meeting without anything being said against it, only one Friend spoke for having it referred till another month. I was sensible it was not agreeable to many Friends at that time and so it appeared more fully at this time. At the time the alteration it was a meeting favored I believe with a degree of the covering of truth and the creaturely part bound down, but at this time the greater part was strong for having the couples pass in the forepart of the meeting, and so it was agreed to alter the rule back to that way again. So they proceed and a poor distressed confused time it was. James Cooper was there and spoke very largely, but I thought death and disorder reigned and great was the weakness that prevailed amongst us that day, I think more than I had ever seen.</div>

One quite killed by a fall on the ice above Burlington- his name Arn Skiler: so that although it seemed a pretty health time in general, yet by one means or another we heard of sudden deaths and burials almost every few days which to relate in particular would be too much for me yet I think the powerful language of mortality should be remembered and serve as admonitions.

The frost continuing very severe and the roads exceeding slippery we heard of divers up and down that were froze to death and one being killed at Sand Town by a fall from his horse.</div>

A heavy dull time it was though some instruction to me this Monthly Meeting at Haddonfield and a pretty calm solid time I thought it was in their last meeting, but the first meeting was but indifferent.
This evening our ancient, four-score, Friend Thomas Evans came home with me. When he came into the house he said, I love to be among the living. I don’t love to be among the dead. I feel as if I was at home or had got home, and a pleasant time we had, and I thought his company was lively and edifying in divers things and he seemed well pleased with the opportunity we had together.</div>

This [2] month 16th Solomon Gaskill came to see me. In conversation he related something strange. I thought he said when he lived at Egg Harbor a few years ago there was a vast quantity of fish drove a shore on the beach, or some such place, supposed to be drove on shore by fishes of prey called horn fish. He said they lay like a windrow on shore and he thought there was certainly by a thousand cart load at least and that he and others of the inhabitants of the shore went with boats and fetched them away as many as they could get casks and salt to procure them in, and that many of them were bit in two and some of their tails bit off and so on, which gave room for such a superstition and that the water was covered with them in many places. Some called the fish Ben haden [?].

This day she was the worst attend with a kind of a cramp and stagnation of blood which threw her into great distress and affliction, in which she desired me to stay be her and not leave her. I perceived she had something on her mind and when the children were gone out she said to me in great tenderness and brokenness of spirit, I have been greatly favored in this affliction beyond what I have deserve my pain has been great but my mind has been preserved above it all. I have many times thought such afflictions are not sent for nothing.* If I live I hope I shall be better and if it should be so ordered that I should leave this world I hope I shall be happy and go to rest and divers times prayed to the Lord for mercy and that there might nothing be sent upon but what she might be enabled to bear. I wish I could be resigned, come what will come. If I am favored then I value it not and divers times said she remembered what the prospect or thoughts of death had been terrifying to her but it had not been so of late.
[sideways in margin] *Oh! How these pains tend to stain the glory of this world, I said. I thought the glory of this world was much stained. In my view I believe it is not so much as it should be in mine  or I need not suffer so much.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1780-03-09">9th of the Third Month 1780. I went to our Monthly Meeting. Our Friend John Simpson was there and William Jones. John had good service in the first meeting and dealt close and plain with us concerning a state of lukewarmness and ease and William had a close turn in the last meeting against mixing with the spirit of the world. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1780: "The Friends appointed produced a Minute of Disownment against William Higbee and Wife, which was read approved and signed by the Clerk: and Jonas Cattell and John Hunt are appointed to give them a Copy thereof and acquaint them of their privilege  of an appeal and report to next Meeting."</note> 
The way opened at this time for a testimony against some wrong customs in accomplishing marriages and passing of the young couples and truth I thought was little raised in dominion and gained some ground at this time amongst us. Our Friend John Simpson proposed to our consideration having solid meetings of conference according to the advice in the extracts concerning the present trials, with which our Monthly Meeting unanimously united and accordingly appointed one to be held at Chester next day the 10 and one the 11 at Evesham, to which time our Monthly Meeting adjourned. Which meetings were accordingly held to good satisfaction and I believe to edification strength and instruction. [Note: Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1780: "The Committee appointed on the request from Chester made Report in Writing: which being several times read was unitedly approved, being as follows.
To the Monthly Meeting at Evesham. We the Committee appointed to consider what satisfaction, is necessary to remove the reproach brought on the society, by those that have taken the Test to the present unsettled Government having all met on the occasion, of deliberately considered the Rules of our Discipline thereon and it is our sense and Judgment that offenders in that respect, that are convinced of the Inconsistency of their Conduct and manifest it by Circumspect Lives, and Conversations: Acknowledgments from such may be accepted of: and we Earnestly desire that friends may be weighty in their spirits that they may be enabled to distinguish the sincerity of such offerings: and if any of the offenders might be favoured with strength to return their Certificates of such Tests to Justices of Courts from whence they came, it would be a Noble Testimony of the sincerity of their Convincement, which is submitted to the Meeting. Signed by order and on behalf of said Committee by Isaac Evans.” ]

<div type="entry" date="1780-03-12">12. We went to Upper Evesham Meeting and John had a pretty deal to say but it was a painful meeting to me. We went to dine at Caleb Evans' and stopped at Enoch’s and had a sitting and John had some service in most private families where we went and came this evening down home with me.
[Left marginal note] a great storm and flood of rain </div>
<div type="entry" date="1780-03-13">13. We went down to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting which was shut up and hard. John made the like proposal there of having meeting of conference, but Friends not uniting with it at that that. John came home with me and I went this evening with him to William Rogers’s. Had a sitting in the family next morning, 14, with some Indians to good satisfaction. I came home and John and William R. went to Moorestown.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1780-03-15">15. Joshua Evans came along here and I went to Mount Holly weekday meeting with him. Here we met with John Simpson again and William Jones and Josiah White had close searching work with them and I thought the spirit of lightness was somewhat balanced down in the conclusion of the meeting. I came home this evening. Remember the account of the grand wedding a few weeks before in that town, a rich man having married and was said and concluded to keep open house three weeks and great entertainments. In a few days after the marriage, their cook fell into the well and hurt herself very badly, and the bride died in about three weeks after they were married. </div>

There having been a very hard winter and a cold backward spring there was the greatest complaint for want of fodder here a way that I had ever heard of. By accounts a great deal worse in some places, in so much that by accounts some hundreds of cattle and other creatures have perished this spring for want of food and the winter grain very much destroyed with the hardness of the winter, the wheat in particular. Many fields looks as if there would not be more than the seed gathered, the prospect of scarcity of cleanness of teeth and want of bread more and more appeared and the cries of the poor began to be heard in our once plentiful and peaceful land. The winter has been so hard that it has killed many trees of the wood and fruit trees and a greatest part of the poke and I think the summer birds* are scarcer this spring. The pewee has not been heard this spring with us; she has not come to build under the eaves of the house as usual.
[Left marginal note] See Jeremiah chapter 4 and 25: all the birds were fled, to Jeremiah the 8 chapter 7 verse
These are melancholy mournful prospects of which the signs of the times in divers particulars have foretold. This several years past, there had been many uncommon things of late years in our land which seemed to threaten desolation, the downfall of the nation or the bringing down or humbling the people, things that bespoke the displeasure of the Almighty.
[Left marginal note] See Chronicles 7:14 verse
Some years ago the hedges died generally all over the Jerseys in one summer. The locusts* and caterpillars were very thick a few years past. The rosbugs were so thick in many places some few years ago that they eat up the young apples in the spring and were so thick on the rye in places that it seemed as if they would destroy it.
[Left marginal note] *Caterpillars kills the timber in many places: Joel 2:25 verse.
There was a last frost one spring a few years ago that cut off some fields of rye, but it grew up beyond expectation.
[Left marginal note] The peach trees died very much
There has been, some seasons since, blasting and mildew amongst the rye and wheat so that it was less than half a crop in many places and great wasting and destruction has been made amongst the wheat and other grain and amongst the hay a few years amongst the soldiery and martial parties. Burning of barns and barrack of wheat in places and stacks of hay and dreadful work in places toting such like thing about to hide them etc.
[Left marginal note] The dry summers some years ago. See Amos 4 chapter and 7 verses
And now there is a good deal of white oak timber and other timber, thousands of cords, killed with the hardness of the frost in the winter and many of the shade trees before our doors are killed.
[Left marginal note] A great part of the most valuable oak timber killed with the hard winter and a very dry summer. The fire broke out in the barren lands and destroyed a great part of the Cedar Swamp.
These things I thought seemed to have something of a language in them like that of Jonah at Nineveh when he proclaimed yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown. <note resp="transcr">Jonah 3:4 </note>  </div>

John Simpson and others those Friends met with the Committee on Reformation but this work went on heavy amongst us and it was concluded to dissolve the old committee. The meeting for Discipline was a favored opportunity and our testimony was raised and gained ground in several respects in regard to the use of strong drink and against wars or any way contributing thereto by payment of taxes or otherwise.

Began business this afternoon about 3 clock. The queries were read and answers likewise at a future sitting. </div>
<div type="entry" date="1780-09-26">26. The epistles were read from the five yearly meetings on this continent and likewise one from London came to this our Yearly Meeting, which seemed a remarkable favor considering the great commotion that were in the earth. This afternoon the minutes of the Meeting for Sufferings were read to general satisfaction and edification. </div>
<div type="entry" date="1780-09-27">Met again on Fourth Day 27, at 10th hour. The state of the Society as it came represented in the queries was laid before this sitting and the general complaint of drowsiness was entered upon and a solid conference was held concerning that of drowsiness. Many very pertinent sentences was dropped concerning that prevailing weakness and concerning them who neglect the attendance of weekday meeting. Friend was closely advised not to put such on business in meetings of discipline but much pressed to a discharge of private labor with them in love. 
Met again at 3rd hour. The meeting proceeded to consider the state of the church as it came represented in the queries, that of the appearance of youth was entered upon and the establishment of schools for their appearance. After a considerable conference thereon and many edifying hints were dropped, Friends concluded with pressing it close home on lesser meetings to keep in view and put in practice the former advices given forth to that meeting on that occasion and seemed to conclude the work was going forward though slowly. It was particularly urged and elderly Friends to labor to forward this good work and be good examples therein. 
Then proceeded to next query concerning our testimony against strong drink, the keeping of public houses, and the distilling of grain and spirits otherwise. This was very closely and zealously spoken to and many lively testimonies were delivered against keeping public houses and the immoderate use of strong drink, stilling of it, or any way retailing it.
<pb id="A0011519_058"/>
Many Friends appeared zealous to step forward to make a rule of Discipline to disown such that would not take Friends advice with respect to tavern keeping, but considering how few years ago many Friend were in the practice of selling much strong drink and that there was an amendment in that respect it was left with strongly advising to a faithful labor against that prevailing evil of the immoderate use of strong drink.
Then proceeded to consider next query concerning oaths or priests wages and war etc. This way considerably spoken to, but left and adjourned to 10th hour next day</div>
<div type="entry" date="1780-09-28">28. Fifth of the week and meeting again assembled according to appointment. The case above mentioned was again resumed concerning the contents of the 6th query and likewise the request from the Western Quarter which was to propose to the Yearly Meeting and consider what might further be done to strengthen Friends in their tender scruples with respect to paying taxes or anyways joining or leaning or swerving from our testimony in any ways contributing to the support of war according to the former advices of our last Yearly Meeting. After a close conference, there being different sentiments amongst Friends concerning paying the taxes now demanded so that it seemed not suitable the case should be fully debated in the meeting, therefore a committee of six Friends out of every quarter with the Committee on the Epistles already appointed was nominated and sent out to consider that case. Friends from the neighboring yearly meetings now present were desired to attend with this committee. Then adjourned to 3rd hour next day.

"The Clerk produced a Minute from our last Quarterly Meeting together with the report of the Committee, relative to the Method of Monthly Meetings proceeding with such of our Members, as have taken the Tests of Allegiance and: which was several times read being as follows (Viz.)</p>
<p>We of the Committee appointed by the Quarterly Meeting agreeable to the request of Evesham Monthly Meeting to consider the Rule of the Yearly Meeting, respecting the Tests of Allegiance &c: having met and solidly considered the same, do give it as our sense and Judgment that although the said Minute is not altogether explicit, it may be safe for Monthly Meetings to require written acknowledgments under Hand, from all who deviate in that matter, to be entered on the Minutes of the Monthly Meeting: and also may proceed to disown all who refuse, or neglect, to make such Acknowledgments to the satisfaction of such Meetings by a Testimony to be entered on their Minutes in like manner.
And we are of the Judgment that while any appear desirous to Avail themselves, of any advantage that may arise from the Certificates given them, on taking such Tests, that they are not brought to a suitable disposition of mind to make an Acknowledgment for such their deviation.</p>
<p>And that where any from true Conviction in their own minds, of the necessity thereof, are made willing to return such their Certificates, friends might encourage and strengthen such therein. Which is submitted to the Meeting by, Edwards Darnel, John Hunt, John Collins, Enoch Evans, Samuel Brown, John Tatum, Aaron Howes, Thomas Redman, Joshua Tompson, Ebenezer Miller, Samuel Lippincott...11th  Month 10th day 1780.”</p></note> </div>

She said I think they are best of that are prepared to die and can go quietly away. At another time she said these pains and affliction, how they stain the glory and beauty of all things in this world. I answered, some have prayed for that.* After some time we had further conversation on it and I said I thought the glory and beauty of the things of this world was much stained in my view. She answered, I believe we most of us have a will of our own however. I believe I have or I need or should not suffer so much. Remarkably relieved of pain all at once. quite easy.

We both agreed that he grew more lively in his ministry in his old age and that i<pb id="A0011519_071"/>
t was generally thought so. He said he was laughed at when he was younger and once thirty years ago in particular a remarkable instance. He said Thomas Evans stood up to speak at Evesham and there was a divers wicked noted profligate fellows began to laugh and whisper together and Thomas took notice of their behavior and spoke to them in particular and said woe to them that laugh now for they shall weep and that the Lord would laugh at their calamity and mock when their fear cometh and if I remember right that they would some of them soon be removed. However so it fell out that divers of that wicked club were soon after taken away by death and one in particular in a most lamentable noted manner. I knew some of them and have often heard of their club, noted for their wickedness and drinking and swearing in particular and by account some of them being asleep in sin did see their passage verified.

<div type="entry" date="1781-09-23">23 This afternoon my wife’s sister and her daughter and I went to Philadelphia to the Yearly Meeting and was at the Bank meeting house, which I thought was but poorish though some lively sentences dropped.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1781-09-23">23. I went to the Big meeting house. Jacob Lindley spoke with great power and authority and was large in testimony. Began business this afternoon. I was on a committee on a case from Warrington and Fairfax Quarter, which was difficult but ended satisfactory. The meeting continued by adjournments till Seventh Day Evening. The most weighty matters that came before this meeting was concerning our testimony against wars, paying taxes etc and against the excess and unnecessary use of strong drink, tavern keeping and the West India trade and the oppression of the poor Blacks. Matters concerning these things was closely lively and powerfully spoke to and truths testimony was raised into dominion over all against these things in great eminence. This meeting, I thought, was not quite so much favored and open as some I have seen, yet I believed it was a time great Instruction, strengthening and edifying to many.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1781-09-01781">1781. At Yearly Meeting. I went to see some acquaintance; Moses Coates and others. One evening related several things. One was concerning the testimony of the Mennonists [Mennonites] against superfluity and against slave keeping as follows: A Friend a hatter some years ago took a parcel of women’s hats to Lancaster to sell and the young Mennonist women were pleased with them and bought them but their elders were not easy with any new fashions coming amongst them and held a conference amongst the Friends. The next time he came with hats to sell, not to be instrument in introducing new fashion or superfluity amongst them but in particular if he brought any more that way to let them be plain and no* ribbons about them.
[Right marginal note] *See our own book of discipline against ribbon about men or women’s hats.
And that one of the Mennonists had agreed for to buy a Negro and next night before he got him home he dreamed he saw a ladder that reached to heaven and he thought he attempted to go up it and there came a Negro man and thrust him off and he attempted the second and third time and the Negro pushed him off each time. And he awoke and concluded he would go back and having no more to do with the Negro and accordingly went back next morning and threw up his bargain. And the Friend said the Mennonists allow none bought in amongst them, that they disown their members for it, and there is no remedy for them that buy them till they make the Negro’s restitution.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1781-09-30">30. I went to Haddonfield meeting. Mary Stevenson, Joshua Gibbs, William Jones all spoke considerably but I thought death and poverty covered the meeting. I had some satisfaction.</div>

Thomas Evans and Deborah Basit spoke but great was the lukewarmess that prevailed amongst the people. A very small number excepted, they are almost become a desolation. As to discipline, I thought they seemed like a bowing wall or a tapering fence, Psalm 62:3 which if one go to rectify (as is common to say) its much but we have it all down about our ears. This was the case at this time. They were settled into normality and could not bear to be moved or searched. We lodged at Annanias Ga[u]nts and had the Rubers but remained unshaken.</div>

One day last week I went to French’s mill and in conversation two things was remarkable and I had not the least room to scruple the truth of them. We were conversing about the scarcity of hay. Joseph Lewis said there was so much destroyed with the worms in the tide meadows he thought it would be scarce. He said he had bought some grass of Benjamin Morgan and had a pretty prospect of a fine crop of grass and in the space of four or five days it was all destroyed with the worms etc. French Jr. said Joseph Reeve (down the river) told him that the worms came in their tide meadows so thick and so sudden that in the space of 48 hours, less he thought, one hundred men with scythes would not have destroyed the grass faster than these worms did. 
The other matter was concerning a great number of small frogs thousands and thousands in the big road.*

As people were coming from market the ruts were full of them, so that people turned out their wagons to omit mashing them with the wheels. They seemed to assign natural causes for these things but it made me think of Pharaoh’s plagues. Read Amos the 7 Chapter and 1st and 2 verses.</div>

My wife and her sister and I met the committee at Moorestown to consider of the advice in the extracts and endeavor to discharge the trust reposed in us by the Monthly Meeting on that accounts. After Friends had given in accounts of considerable labor in visiting of many families to their satisfaction and encouragement, we then had a very close searching time amongst ourselves which I had long thought was much wanting and had long believed was the place of beginning. It was my lot to urge and say many things very closely amongst us with respect to our conformity to the spirit and customs of the world. This made very heavy work with us a while. At length some cautions were dropped about going too fast and it seemed as if I should been over sat for a while, but at length things took a lively turn and the meeting concluded to advantage and satisfaction. We came off with whole bones and flying colors. <note resp="transcr">It may be of interest to note that in the Friends Miscellany published version of the Journal, the suggestion that John Hunt was pushing harder for reform than was acceptable to others at the time has been hidden. In place of "It was my Lot to urge & Say many things very closely amongst us with Respect to our Conformity..." the editors have "and many things were closely urged amongst us, in respect to our conformity with the spirit and customs of the world.

{1782-08}
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-08">I was confined at home, very weak and poorly till the 8th of the Eighth Month. I went to our Monthly Meeting. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, August 1782: "Samuel Allinson, John Hunt, William Rogers and Lawrence Webster are apponted to prepare Essays of Memorials, or Minutes, for our deceased Friends Isaac Evans and Rachel Engle, and produce them to next Meeting."</note>  James Simpson, Isaac Zane and John Reeve was there. The first meeting middling, the last like to end well till a subject concerning taxes and tests was started and then there was scuffling work with us but I hope it will tend to good in the end.
[Left marginal note] James Simpson made mention of the drought. Without me ye can do nothing <note resp="transcr">John 15:5</note>  temporal or spiritual, but if clouds are detained we must wither as the grass for want of rain and a lively pertinent sentence it was.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-09">9. Was youth’s meeting at Moorestown. I thought there was too much preaching quite but yet I thought it might be a profitable meeting to many.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1782-08-012:13 and 14">12:13 and 14. I was at John Inskeep’s showing my boys how to go on with some pump work. Put a new top piece to one 12 feet long and made a new one 31 feet, 6 [inches] long. Now although I had been about to those meetings and with my boys about the pumps I was exceeding poorly, hardly able to crawl about and stirring about and being very weak the fever returned more strong upon me.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-15">15. Was weekday meeting. I was at home very poorly. Now for some time past there was a vast plenty of the necessaries of life, bread, corn in particular and especially wheat which was sold at town for 13 s[hillings] per hundred, which was much lower that it had been for many years and hundreds of barrels spoiled and turned sour for want of salt. Some bought the damaged flour to feed their hogs. Now this was very contrary to the prospect of a few years ago* which was a prospect of cleanness of teeth and want of bread. 
[Left marginal note] *Bread corn very scarce a few years ago and hard to come at.
<pb id="A0011519_089"/>
But now there is the most piercing extensive drought that has been known this many years so that this fall crop is likely to be much cut off, wells and watercourses fail so that people so far as we can hear from east to west are much straightened for water in their families and for watering their flocks and herds and at the grist mills etc. There is a greater pinch on these account than there has been many years but nothing yet in comparison to what hath been in former years. See Jeremiah 14 chapter, Amos, Chapter 4: 7 verse, Zechariah, Chapter 14 and 17 verse.
See Isaiah 5th : 6 verse, Job 38 Chapter, 28 verse 
Job 12: 15th verse: He withholdeth the waters and they dry up. 
Isaiah 42:15. I will dry up herbs. I will dry up the pools, which is now the case with us. See the 44 chapter 27 verse of Isaiah, Jeremiah 51 chapter 36 verse, Zechariah 10:12 verse. The deeps of the river shall dry up. The clouds have frequently gathered and many times great tokens of a wet dripping time and yet go off in an uncommon manner with very little rain.

<div type="entry" date="1782-08-22">22. I went to Lower Evesham Meeting which was to me the best meeting I have had a long time. A satisfactory time to divers of us.
After meeting Samuel Allinson, William Rogers, Lawrence Webster and myself met to fulfill our appointment from the Monthly Meeting in preparing memorials for Isaac Evans and Rachel Ingle elders deceased. I thought we parted after business was over in a satisfactory pleasant manner. <note resp="transcr">Hunt and others were appointed by Evesham Monthly meeting "to prepare Essays of Memorials, or Minutes, for our dec'd Friends Isaac Evans and Rachel Engle, & produce them to next meeting" from the Minutes of Evesham Monthly meeting, August 1782.</note> </div>

<div type="entry" date="1782-08-26">26th of the Eighth Month 1782. I went to the Quarterly Meeting at Burlington. George Churchman was there, an elder. Ministers: Thomas Ross, John Simpson, Daniel Offley and Samuel Emlen and others, Robert Willis. They preached stoutly, but if life was raised into dominion over all, it was hid from me. But in the Meeting for Business there was something lively at times. I had satisfaction. I went to lodge with Aaron Wills.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-27">27. We went to Burlington. Was a committee meeting in the morning on suffering cases. A number of Friends from Hardwick having been fined for refusing to take the test from 5 pounds to £300. Some several were fined £300 and some less down to £5. Their cases were laid open to this committee, in which I had some satisfaction.
[Left marginal note] *27 I was at Yearly Meeting at Burlington which was pretty well.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-28">28. I went with my boys to make a pump for David Davis, 20 long. Paid. A bottom piece. </div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-29">29. At work at Davis’s pump in the morning and afternoon, but this was our preparative meeting day. Joshua Evans came along and I went with him up to Evesham meeting. The first meeting was pretty well. With the consent of Friends (both men and women), we were permitted to sit with the women whilst they were answering their queries and a very open lively time it was to the satisfaction of ourselves and a number of the women Friends, as they expressed after the meeting was over.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-30">30. This morning we finished Davis’s pump and then set off to Samuel Thomlinson’s to make him a pump.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-08-31">31. We finished Thomlinson’s pump, 22 [feet] long, and came home. Was First Day morning. See Rutty’s Diary, page 120. He says, “On a review of my spiritual registry- Amidst all weaknesses and sins an invisible power was underneath and preserved from destruction. What dangers of drinking, whoring, seeking practices for money, and anger have beset me! I adore the Divine mercy for my preservation to this day.” Went to our meeting. A very poor time it was indeed.

<div type="entry" date="1782-09-02">Second Day of the week. Went to our large committee meeting on reformation. Joshua Evans was there and his wife. The forepart of this meeting was dull, but it grew better after a while and a lively favored time I thought it was in the end. The tea table and fine tea tackling and fine ceilinged houses and fine rooms <note resp="transcr"> Journal gives "ornamented rooms," 233.</note>  was closely kicked about. Likewise the use and abuse of strong drink and distilling of cider etc was closely testified against. Some could hardly bear it. The testimony of truth gained ground over a wrong spirit.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1782-09-03">3 of the Ninth Month, 1782. I went to Henry Wood’s to work at his pump.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1782-09-05">5. I went with wife and children to Monthly Meeting, which was a pretty lively time with me for the most part, but the meeting was hurt in the conclusion by straining the point on distillery tighter than some could bear.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-06">6. At work at a pump for George Gatkins, 14 [feet] long.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-07">7. Finished Gitkin’s pump.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-08">8. First Day. See Rutty’s <italic>Diary</italic>, page 76. He says, “At meeting -- I will not estimate myself by the opinion of men but by thy judgments, Lord, and despise myself,” and a little after expresses how hard it is to get out of the briars, and then expresses how poor he is in the Lord’s presence. Went to our meeting. But middling.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-09">9. I went down to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. I had a pretty lively times and satisfaction but there is too much formality in answering queries and some other things. Boy were about Hugh Cowperthwait’s pumps. I went to see Enoch Roberts.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-11">11. At work at pumps. Then at home.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-12">12. Went to our meeting, which was silent and that not right perhaps. We put in Hugh Cowperthwaite’s pump, 30 feet long.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-13">13. Went to the burial of Enoch Roberts. Robert Willis was there. Thomas Evans and Robert both spoke. A poor time to me, but its likely a favored time to a many who seldom attended meetings.
We put in a pump this evening for Richard Glovyer at Moorestown, 23 feet 2 inches long, which we made here at home this week.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-09-14">14. We went to Henry Woods to work at his trouble from [his] pump again. Made it go well at last and left it in good order. His pump 44 [feet] 6 [inches] long at 1 s[hillings] 6 per foot and a dollar for the boxes.

As I came home I overtook a poor woman with a child on her back and another at her heels traveling.

Aaron Mills, cousin William Hunt’s relation by marriage and his companion, informed me the drought was much there as it is here and that their country was so infested with robbers that the people were frequently surprised in the night robbed and stripped of their money, goods and horses and cattle.

Now read John Griffith Journal page 369. I find my cousin William Hunt’s journal <note resp="transcr">William Hunt’s journal was not published until 1858.</note>  in manuscript this account page 200. To wit, on the 18 of the Second Month 1770 at a meeting at Center in North Carolina:
William Hunt in his testimony which was very extensive at that time; after earnestly exhorting us individually to examine our foundation whereon we had built or were building and in urging the necessity of such an examination, had the following predictive expressions. For, saith he, the Lord will visit this land with his judgments and then it will be known who hath built upon the sure foundation and who hath not. For in that time of deep trials the hypocrites, formalists, and nominal Quakers will not only suffer, but many will perish and come to naught, whilst those who have built upon the sure rock of ages will be preserved by him in the midst of those trials as it were in the hollow of his hands. And there are many grown, and now within the audience of my voice that shall see those times come to pass. 
Wrote by Robert Brattin the day and year above written.
[Left marginal note] Great wars in them parts and great trials and strippings and disolations.
[Left marginal note] About the year 1778:9 this came to pass.
Second Month 1768. At a Monthly Meeting held at Flushing some expressions of William Hunt towards the last of his testimony when he was about to take his leave of us. He appeared to be zealously concerned for his Friends and brethren that kept men and women in bondage and signified that his mind travailed for their redemption and in the following words expressed his mind, I verily believe the jubilee year is near at hand, and I desire those that have them may not put it of for their children to let them at liberty, for we know not what our children will prove to be. Therefore I earnestly desire that none may put it beyond the appointed time. For if they do, I am firmly of the mind they will be plagued, as sure as ever Egypt was for retaining Israel. This is the substance, if not the very words that dropped from his mouth, remembered by me Hendy Post.
[Left marginal note] See John Griffin page 379,380 he says he is satisfied truth will never prosper amongst people that keep mankind in bondage
<pb id="A0011519_094"/>
See my account in 1771 31st Third Month. Was at Evesham Meeting with my cousin William Hunt. In his testimony he signified he was sensible of a very great and dark cloud that covered the people. He that loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him was part of his subject. He spoke exceeding notably a considerable time. He appeared the second time. Signified the time drew near in which he believed the Truth would spread and shine more glorious, though there might be a time of probation and trial first. Signified he thought the man was grown that would live to see it.
I was at Upper Springfield meeting with my cousin William Hunt. In his public testimony, he charged us to note it down and said he had but little hopes of this present generation but it was his belief that the next generation would make a better progress in the truth. He said he believed there was some little lads there that would live to see it. One sat by me, a little boy much tendered at that time.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1782-11-05">5 of the Eleventh Month, 1774. I went in to Evesham Meeting appointed for Robert Walker from Old England, whose testimony was very searching in many respects. He told us of the many favors we have had, and the warning and that whither we would choose or refuse the Lord would have a people. That he would call others if we refused, and that the day was dawned that would never be totally eclipsed. And that the indignation and wrath of the Almightily would be poured out on this land in a great degree if the people did not return. And that God would be clear and his servants would be clear and our blood would be upon our own heads. And reminded us of the many warnings we have had and of the Negroes in the Southern provinces. I think he intimated that he thought there would be a heavy settlement in them provinces on that account. A neighbor of mine remarked that he mentioned something of an overflowing scourge that would pass over the land* which has been the case since, and now reaches to the utmost corners of our continent in 1782 and has for years past.
[Left marginal note]*now in 1782*
I remember soon after we were settled I was building a house or kitchen for Isaac Lippincott and went to our meeting appointed for Thomas Gawthrop from England and he said he had not come the third time into this wilderness country to sew pillows to the arms of the people. No, says he, I am not come to cry peace but a sword. There is a bright polished, quickening sword prepared for this nation. I said once at Philadelphia that the people Smoaked and that there would be an opening of graves, which has all since remarkably come to pass. <note resp="transcr">See also Friends Miscellany 1 (1831): 96, where this incident is dated 1766.</note> </div>

At the close of the first meeting he testified nobly against distillery. He termed it the stumbling block of their iniquity and desired us to have recourse to the chapter and verses See Jeremiah 6 Chapter and 17:18:19:20:21 verses.

<div type="entry" date="1783-05-19">19. Second of the week. We were at Quarterly Meeting at Salem. A poor time. Nothing so lively handled at the testimony against strong drink and custom of gathering of harvest.

<div type="entry" date="1783-05-20">20. Was Yearly Meeting. Thomas Ross and Peter Yarnall was very much favored with a lively searching ministry both in select meeting and others.
There was a most dreadful spirit of darkness and heaviness beset the assemblies. Many well concerned growing Friend complained much of this and great poverty, trying hard meetings. There must be a hidden cause for it. We came up the road to Piles Grove with the strangers who complained very heavily – “I can’t live so I must ran home”: this was the language. A state of ease And formality too much prevails. The people are rich, fullness of bread and abundance of spiritual idleness prevails that way. But notwithstanding all this, I believe it was a time of great instruction to me and I believe to many more.
Joshua Lippincott and I came up to Samuel Lippincott’s to lodge. Here we had a close time in conversation about the appearance of children and we had something of this sort in most places where we happened and in most places it answered right well.

Sometimes very heavy, trying, hard, discouraging, proving seasons to that degree that I thought at times we must sink and give out, but I believe he whose service we were desirous to be found In was mindful of us and helped us with a little help in the most pinching needful time. And on the whole I believe there was a clear demonstration and evidence that the great Master owned the service which was strengthening and confirming and satisfactory and was reward enough.

<div type="entry" date="1783-08-05">5. We were at Chesterfield Monthly Meeting. Joshua Evans and I went in amongst the women whilst they were answering their queries and had an open satisfactory time with them. The women’s meeting there is in a far better state than the men’s. According to my sense, their state, the men’s meeting, as a meeting of discipline at that time appeared in a very declining condition. (The whole head is sick. See Isaiah 1st chapter and 5 verse) I left the meeting in distress of mind. We went to Clayton Newbold’s to lodge. I thought we did not mind our business here so well as we should.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1783-08-07">7 and fifth of the week. I met with the above mentioned Friends at Mount Holly Monthly Meeting. Here we had a poor distressing time of it. The earth is got uppermost. Business neglected and in confusion, the Leaders cause them to err. Nothing could be done. They seemed to me something like what we read in Isaiah 30 and 13 verse: Swelling out in a high wall etc, or as we read in Psalms See 62:3 verse As a bowing wall shall ye be, as a tottering fence. It seemed to me the groundwork wanted laying new from the bottom.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1783-08-08">8. We came down to our Monthly Meeting.

Meditations on the earthquake 1763

Heaven often before the fatal bolt is hurled, 
Gives timely notice to an erring world,
Some lesser woes are harbingers of great,
O! sinner, fear and dread approaching fate,
Whilst harmless thunder and whilst gentle shocks,
Still at thy door for reformation knocks,
Rouse from thy stupid lethargy of sin,
Turn penitent and own thy God within,
Or be assured that the increased power
Will overtake thee in an evil hour.</div>

I said I did not know whither such accounts in the news could be depended on. George said he made not doubt of it. Such things had been [illegible].

<div type="entry" date="1784-01-30">30:[31]. Vincent Leeds and Samuel Leed and William Rogers come to see me. Vincent proposed to me to accompany him, he being young in the ministry and about to visit some meetings in the compass of Burlington Quarter, but it was so low and poor times with me that I could hardly tell what to do for I thought I was good for nothing at home or abroad. However on the 31st First Month and Seventh [Day] of the week I went to Vincent Town meeting appointed for Vincent Leeds it being the first he ever appointed. Came off pretty well but I was still poor though I had something to do where we dined. After dinner I was for returning home but Friends stuck to me and tugged me along and we went to Aaron Wills’s to lodge.</div>
{1784-02}
<div type="entry" date="1784-02-01">1 of the Second Month. We went to Ancocas meeting. Vincent Leeds had a good deal to say and Elizabeth Collins was there, and here I had good satisfaction at the conclusion of the meeting. All seemed well and pleasant when meeting broke up.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1784-02-06">6. Went to our Monthly Meeting. Benjamin Jones and Benjamin Linton was there and John Reeves. John had a great deal to say. This was the second time the extract was consider and that part concerning visiting of families came most closely before the meeting. At this meeting as at the last there was a number for having a committee appointed to have the care of that matter and consider it with women Friends but others opposed it and a poor shattered miserable time it was. I do believe a wrong light chaffy spirit was in dominion and opposed the truth. Or so it seemed to me. And I am satisfied the more weighty part of our members that were for journeying forward out of the wilderness or world’s spirit were crushed down. So the case was referred. Many seemed stiff and could get up and speak in this meeting which in some of our most favored solid meetings were not heard to open their mouths. And to speak of the work of the reformation now as in times past won’t do. Many can’t bear to come under a close search and seem determined to go not further so that it seems as if we should loose sight of this concern for reformation.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1784-02-11">11th of the Second Month, 1784. I set off into Pennsylvania. Very cold weather. Crossed the river on the ice. I lodged at Benjamin Maul’s. There is an innocent hopeful young couple.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1784-02-12">12. I went to Moses Coats to lodge.
[Sideways marginal note] I had thoughts of putting my son Joseph apprentice to Moses Coats to learn the smith’s trade and I went on that account.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1784-02-13">13. I went to Bradford Monthly Meeting which was very much disturbed by a man in a kind of frenzy or in a ranting spirit. Friends stood at the doors and kept him out but he preached as loud as he could scream great part of the time of both meetings. But a poor time, though I thought there was a considerable number of substantial Friends both men and women belonging to that meeting. <note resp="transcr">Bradford Monthly Meeting minutes, February 1784: "Chester Monthly Meeting by two of their Members returned the Certificate granted by this Meeting in the fourth month last, for John Iddings, Informing he Removed from them before the Certificate came to hand, the Circumstance being considered this meeting accepts thereof and Refers his case to the care of Caln preparative Meeting." </note>  I went to Richard Barnard's to lodge. An old man with a large family of children and all very much in the moderation and plainness. He had one room put in order for a school and the oldest learned <note resp="transcr">Journal gives "instructed," 236.</note>  the younger.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1784-02-14">14. I went to the select meeting at London Grove. Jacob Lindley spoke very smartly and lively but it was but poor times (the weather exceeding cold) though I did believe there was a considerable number of very wise deep discerning Friends. Though I believe it was a winter season inwardly as well and outwardly. One thing I remarked-- this Select Quarterly Meeting had a committee appointed to visit their select members which I have had a prospect of and much approved of. I went to Jacob Lindley’s to lodge.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1784-02-15">15. We went to New Garden meeting. Jacob Lindley preached and prayed very powerfully but it was a poor time with me. The people here are very plain and many very wise solid Friends and though there was a large door of utterance opened and it may be as bread cast upon the waters and found after many days yet. I went to dine with Benjamin Mason. An elder and a quick sighted one too, accounted to be a wise man amongst wise men. But it seemed like a winter season each way.
I went to William Dixon’s (in 1783 William Dixon’s son killed [in the] war<italic>) </italic>to lodge this family, both parents and children, I think stand the fairest in religion and especially in the work of the reformation that I have yet met with; that is to take them all together. I had some satisfaction in this family. Read at bottom.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1784-02-16">16*
[From bottom of the page] 16 was Quarterly Meeting at London Grove. The men and women sit down in their different apartments and hold the first meeting but short. This is allowed to be the largest Quarterly Meeting and a very solid wise number of Friends and much united in their testimony against taxpaying and superfluity. A very plain people.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1784-02-17">17. We went to Yearly Meeting at London Grove and in the forepart there was a prospect of a very fine opportunity, but the man above mentioned, whom Friends there thought was got into a spirit of ranterism. (And I did believe there was a very large number of weighty solid Friends who were favored with that gift of discerning of spirits.) 
This crazy ranter came in, began to preach as loud as he could, but made little stops. And a woman Friend rose up and he kept still which is always he way for he loves to hear preaching. The woman had a very lively testimony but not very long. Then he began again, but made little stops and he spoke very well and seems very hopeful.* Then presently Thomas Vickers spoke a considerable time but I thought the little silent parts of the meeting was the best. To me the meeting was much hurt with the ranting crazy man. I was poorly and got but little satisfaction. I went to Thomas Woodward’s to lodge, an ancient, innocent, sweet spirited minister. His children in good order: plain etc. 
[Left marginal note] *Ritt fell to drinking his old failing again soon after.

There was several very close searching sentences dropped concerning taxpaying and several Friends seemed to think it was time of more danger now than it was in the time of the war. Jacob Lindley spoke closely concerning Friends letting collectors etc. pay their tax and then settle with them. Another Friend dropped a caution to beware of the dragon’s tail and said what had been suffered to try Friends in years past might be like the teeth or the claws of the dragon. This Quarterly Meeting and select meeting have the case of schools very lively before them.
I came from Thomas Woodward’s about 18 miles to Caleb Pierce’s (to lodge). A substantial elder who had a large family of children. All seemed near and alive in the truth. An exemplary family throughout.</div>

Hardness of heart and insensibility prevailed. There was a great concourse of people and many of the Baptists. It might be a meeting satisfactory to some but to me it was a most distressing time. I went to Samuel Gaskill’s to dine in company with Solomon Gaskill. This evening we came to cousin Joseph Fowlers to lodge whose wife is an elder and something like a Deborah in these parts. See Judges the 5 chapter and 7 verse. This Friend soon began to feel and sympathize with me and came and sat down by me, after some little time we seemed to drop into a silence and Deborah had not lost her feeling. Soon began to collect her children and servants together which was somewhat startling to me though I much commended the motion. We sat down in silence and had a refreshing satisfactory time together.</div>

Redman bring an account from Long Island that there is a worm now cutting down the corn so that there is like to be no harvest there.* Look back to the account Silas Downing page 127.

<div type="entry" date="1784-06-11">11. We went to Monthly Meeting. James Thorington was there and Isaac Zane. James had good service in the first meeting and also in the last. The meeting for business began well and went on lively a while. I had good satisfaction in the forepart of it but it growed poorer and poorer towards the ends, and ended but low. Search for the cause why it was so. A want of more care to keep down to the root. I see more and more cause to remember this passage viz. Without me ye can do nothing. And as one formerly said, if thy presence go not with us send us not hence, or to this effect. See Psalms 87: verse 2.
Our testimony against strong drink was raised and lively [illegible] in the forepart of the business.

Philadelphia: Joseph Cruckshank, 1774.</note>  He gave me an account of their dissenting from Friends and for what reason and that he believed the time would come where they would be joined to Friends. The reason as he informed me of that people being separated from Friends was one Joseph Nichols appeared in the ministry amongst Friends and soon became large and very zealous and particularly so against superfluity of all kinds believing unnecessary expense in all its branches, sprang from an evil root and so thought it needful to come out of in every particular. And so being very zealous he went out from amongst Friends, he thinking Friends too cold and indifferent about these things and they thinking him and his followers too zealous. But this Friend J. Register told me that in his visit they told him they thought that as Friends were now more warm about them things and thought it likely that they should come together again.

Joshua Evans and Solomon Gaskill was there and the meeting in the forepart was pretty well but a remarkable dull heavy time seemed to come over us about the middle of the meeting for want of more care in several appearances and one especially I thought much hurt the meeting, but we seemed to get into our gears again and I thought the meeting ended pretty lively and well though still a great want of openness and ears to hear things were many times pressed very close and tight.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1784-10-28">28. A like meeting was held at Lower Evesham. William Savery and Arthur Howell, S. Gaskill and Joshua Evans was there and we had abundance of preaching but I think it was a low poor sort of a shut up time. In one sense though I am ready to think it might be a time of profit to many perhaps many days hence and although these meetings were not so open and lively yet I believe there will service arise from them divers ways.</div>

He fully believed that suffering for not paying of taxes did come within the meaning of the Yearly Meeting and that the Yearly Meeting had owned that testimony and would never disown that birth which had been brought forth by the tender scruples of suffering Friends who refused to pay taxes for to defray the expense of war.

<div type="entry" date="1785-07-10">10 of the Seventh Month 1785. First Day morning I took up Samuel Bownas' <italic>Journal</italic>. In page 185 he says: as I was going to bed, about ten at night there was an exceeding great earthquake that made a noise like the driving of carts or wagons on an uneven causeway. It continued about two minutes to the great surprise of the people, it was felt about fifteen hundred miles as was after computed and as was thought by calculation was not quite three hours in going that space. <note resp="transcr">Samuel Bownas, Journals of the Lives and Travels of Samuel Bownas and John Richardson. Philadelphia: William Dunlap, 1759.</note> 
[Left marginal note] See my account, 1783, 29 Eleventh Month about 10 at night just got to bed.
See page 189, he says, I went to visit a Friend that was much afflicted with lowness of spirit and in a despairing way although he had from his youth been a very sober and orderly man but providence having favored him with considerable substance he imagined he transgressed in having everything too fashionable and too rich and did not serve his maker with his substance as he ought to have done, this was a great load upon him. 
See the last of Sophia Hume’s <italic>Extracts</italic>. She notes William Edmundson’s words expressed in a very weighty manner on account of the increase of fine things, fashions and pride on this wise, surely will not the Lord visit for these things. <note resp="transcr">Apparent reference to Sophia Hume, Extracts from Divers Ancient Testimonies of Friends. Wilmington, [Delaware</note>: James Adams.] 
Now see Bownas’ further account of the earthquake, page 190, in a letter from his Friends, informing him of the earthquake before noted. How that at Newberry, Haverill, Amesbury and places adjacent it continued for fourteen days and was felt a long ways on the banks of Merrimack River. The account was confirmed by many who felt it who declared themselves afraid to remain in their houses during the several shocks which returned every twenty four hours, continuing about the space of three minutes. The inhabitants did much blame themselves for their pride and luxury taking this to be a judgment upon them for these things. 
See [Thomas] Chalkley, page 585 and 57. See Genesis 18:20: The cry of Sodom is great, those who like Esau sell their birthright forsake their own mercies and may great and bitter cry and not be heard in a day of calamity. It’s a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.
[Left marginal note] See Isaiah 29 and 6 verse and Amos 1:1 verse; and Zachariah 14 and 15 verse, like as ye fled from before the earthquake; Revelation 8: 2 verse, There were thundering and an earthquake.

And although at this time I had satisfaction in clearing myself yet with respect to most of these matters I think we have lost ground. Except that of the use of spirituous liquors.

<div type="entry" date="1785-09-22">22. I went to the select meeting at Haddonfield. John Storer, John Townsend, and Thomas Colley from England was there. Townsend had good acceptable service amongst us in the first meeting and Storer had searching service in the last concerning answering our queries too superficial light a manner. He queried how we could expect help if we did not send true accounts of the state of our meetings etc. Much to my relief and confirmation Joshua Owin came home with me and lodged.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1785-09-23">23. Was Quarterly Meeting. The above mentioned strangers from England was there T. Colley spoke first and very well but Storer had the chief service. Was pretty large. He appeared to me to be a very great and powerful lively minister. John Townsend appeared in prayer. Storeer appeared the second time and it appeared to be a time of fresh visitation onto the youth and I doubt not but many were reached and their states closely spoken to. And so a good meeting to many. The meeting for business was in my apprehension an old-fashioned sort of a time, too much formality and contentedness therein in answering our queries. So it was but a low time to me yet there were many pertinent edifying sentences dropped by strangers and others, John Simpson in particular, respecting living within the bounds of our circumstances. Although we could say we did live within the bounds of our circumstances and none like to be losers by us, yet he intimated a thought that were going into a high way of living and bringing up our children, that our country could not support the succeeding generation. So advised to moderation and to make few our wants</div>

I went to select meeting at Philadelphia. The forepart of the meeting was I thought but low though several sentences dropped. One I thought hit the spot which was that if we ever found ourselves approved in the sight of the great Master it must be by looking inward not outward. The last part of the meeting was a favored edifying time and the principle matter that came before the meeting with weight was that of too formal light superficial a way of answering the queries. The two ancient English Friends Storer and Townsend and James Thorins seemed much concerned and affected on that account. Thorington said he was afraid they would become a snare instead of a help to us. It was closely pressed on the representatives to treasure up, carry home, and spread the sense of that meeting, the painful sense as they expressed it on Thomas account.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1785-09-25">25. I went to Newtown Meeting with John Simpson and John Hurst from Virginia. They had deal to say but I thought it was but a lowish time though Simpson spoke very close and pertinent to the youth and others.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1785-10-09">9. Was First Day. John Simpson was there and he had close scraping service indeed. I thought it was rather exposed the state of Friends too much in such a promiscuous multitude. He was wonderful in drawing comparison from the Old Testament and spiritually comparing them to our present state, exhorted us to keep up the morning and evening sacrifice and mentioned what room there was for remarks to be made on us. Why, say they, if you was to go and live with them a twelve month you’d not see anything like religious service performed in their families and that we had need be careful we did not lose both form and substance. For, he said, he could not recommend to keep up the form without the substance, that is, the form of morning and evening prayer etc. John came home with us and lodged.</div>

<pb id="A0011519_156"/>
<div type="entry" date="1785-10-11">11 of the Tenth Month. I lodged with John Simpson at Joshua Evan and in conversation he related an account of a house called Bridewell in [New] York where they confine straggling vagabond people or disorderly people for fighting, drunkening, whoring or other disorderly conduct. Instead of whipping them they are often sentenced by justices to go to Bridewell so many days or hours according to their faults and there they are kept to work so that their labor nearly supported the expense of this house of correction and they have little dark cells or dungeons to clap them in. The keeper told him that he seldom ever found one stout enough to bear the punishment of one of them dungeons more than twenty-four hours, for their practice is to go to them every twelve hours and make proposals with which if they comply they are let out of their cells or dungeons and so to work according to the keepers orders. He said he asked the keeper how he did to keep such orders and authority. And he said, not let them have any strong drink and it was easy done and not else. And if any brought or sold any rum or the like so that it came to that house they were sentenced to the dungeon. He said the prisoners often came to the keeper pleading their causes for relief and were heard. If they could make a fair story they had redress if not turned away. To there they told him there came and sturdy fellow and walked about the house and the keeper asked him what his business was there. He said he had as good a right to walk about the house as he. Oh so you have, says the keeper, then beckoned to some of his men and clapped him in the dungeon for his sauce and this method seemed to be generally better approved and less expense than whipping at the whipping post as is common at Philadelphia and other places.
He gave us an account of a new sect of people called Shakers or Shaking Quakers separated from the Presbyterians far back up the North River who were very strange in their conduct and religious performance that they in pretense of compliance with that passage of scripture which exhorts to do what our hands find to do, to do with all our might, and so they run into strange and violent actions and strains in performing their worship.* And they say that the world is near to an end. That way it is to come about their society are none to marry and if married not to have any children born amongst them. And if husbands or wives be convinced of their way, that is one and not the other, they part and this makes dreadful work where that happens. And that their number very much increases. He said they would not argue with any, that if any went to talk or reason with them they would say we are the teachers and all others were to hear them and so would stop t<pb id="A0011519_157"/>
heir fingers in their ears if any went to reason with them concerning their way of worship, manners or customs. He said he did not see them nor did not want to go a near them but a public Friend told him so that he believed it as much as if he seen it. And he informed me that the worm** on Long Island which destroys the harvest did very much spread over the country.

[Left marginal note] See page 132
The tides over all their banks and water in peoples cellars; wells filled; flood gates washed away and tide dams greatly broken. Indian Corn under water in most lowish places and the rye much beaten down so that there seemed a very melancholy prospect. A great complain of scarcity of grain (except wheat) and some think it likely to be scarcer next year. The poor people in the Barrens and Egg Harbor much pinched for grain. 
[Left marginal note] Many thousands of pound loss to the Jerseys.
[Left marginal note] Remarkable wet time 1786.
I think I remember some years past to have read in the newspapers of the inhabitants of Holland being reduced to famine by too much wet and now talked of a harvest in Ireland they called the rot harvest by reason of the abundance of wet and I remember to have heard some of our ancients mention the harvest here called the wet harvest that after the grain was shocked in the field it was so wet that it grew till the shocks and stacks of wheat were green and there seemed a prospect of the staff of bread being cut off, and now the wet and greatness of the dam is such that a miller J.B. told me his bolting cloth clogged up so that he could not bolt and of the like complain in other places. Now look back to page 116 of the account of drought. <note resp="transcr">Page 116 covers August 26 to 31, 1782.</note>

Good order and good temper in the conference was kept though very different sentiments and in two parties about it. It was a pretty good edifying time. I had satisfaction and I believe the meeting will be of benefit. He was left with his beard on much as we found him and comparatively speaking none had strength or a pair of scissors given them or razor to cut it off.*

Thomas Scattergood was also there and had good service in meeting of business. John Cox also present. 
Although ability was given to laborers to labor our weakness was great and crowd to be felt. It seems to me we have answered queries in our own way and own strength till we are left to ourselves and to fell our own weakness, deadness and dryness so that it is painful distressing business much more so than any that comes before us. Almost ready to get to sleep over the queries. Maybe it is the lowest ebb and the tide near turning. So hope for the best. 
It is remarkable latterly at our Monthly Meetings how we are favored with the company of strangers. Our galleries mostly filled so that we look strong both men and women’s side. All the upper seats crowded full.</div>

J Stoner spoke concerning a dull heavy spirit that too often prevailed in select meetings and the cause why it was so for want of more diligence. Very deep and wise remarks he made. There was two choice women from the eastward: Rahway and one from Long Island appeared in prayer.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1786-09-22">22. Was Quarterly Meeting. J. Storer had a very lively testimony. In the last meeting we had it up and down again about tax paying.

<div type="entry" date="1786-09-25">25. I went to Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. Select began at 8. I kept no strict regular narrative of the conduct of this Yearly Meeting for want of leisure and private conveniency or in part because of the poverty and discouragement I was under, but I believe upon the whole it was a profitable humbling time to me. The meetings for worship were favored mostly with a very powerful ministry chiefly John Storer, James Thorington, Jacob Lindley, Job Scott from New England and Tideman Hull and divers others. In some meetings I felt some tenderness but soon shut up again in meetings for business. Ability was given to laborers and they did speak with life and clearness to many matters and with great edification. The most material matters that seemed to attract Friends attention was as well as I remember that of the care of the youth and the custom of their company keeping at unseasonable times of nights, revived by Job Scott and smartly handled. And lively cautions to Friends to beware of taking any active part in government either to elect or be elected. And that case from our quarter respecting meeting by a large committee and those of that side that refused to pay maintained their ground and it was concluded to encourage Friends that suffered the spoiling of their goods on that account, to bring forward their sufferings to be recorded in the Meeting of Suffering. Our select meeting ended on Second Day Morning, 2nd, Tenth Month, about 12 Clock.</div>

The extracts referred to of 1781. Simpson was favored and had good service in both meetings. It was a high day and the testimony was raised and things very closely spoken to especially that of our young people keeping company together. There is a stir, a travel, a journeying forward. I remember a few years ago the extracts used to be read at the close of a monthly Meeting, laid by, and nothing said about them which used to be painful to me. John Simpson and his companion William Bidgood came home with me whose company was very edifying and strengthening. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, December 1786: "The Request for holding a Meeting in the School House near Cropwell Creek being resumed and further considered, it was apprehended a benefit might arise from a Committee of this meeting being appointed to set with Friends at each place agreeable to the prepar'd division, previous to any decisive conclusions being drawn on the occasion; to which service the following Friends are appointed viz.

The lamentation of the careless in the day of trial and calamity was heard to be as great as that of the thief and the murderer, he said.
I heard a few days ago of Vincent Leads his sad fall with his relation, a young woman very plain and both high in profession and John Simpson told me of the sad fall of Margaret Porter and Robert Hatton. Both giving way to drunkenness. The two men were very hopeful young ministers and both recommended and traveled some. M. Porter was a few years past remarked for a lively growing minister.

We of the Committee appointed by the Quarterly Meeting agreeable to the request of Evesham Monthly Meeting, to consider the rule of the Thearly Meeting respecting the Tests of Allegiance andc having met and solidly considering the same, do give it as our sense and Judgment, that altho the said Minute is not altogether explicit, it may be safe for Monthly Meetings to require written Acknowledgments under Hand, from all who deviate in that matter, to be entered on the Minutes of the Monthly Meeting; and also may proceed to disown all who refuse or neglect to make such acknowledgments to the satisfaction of such meetings by a testimony to be entered on their Minutes in like manner. And we are of the Judgment, that while any appear desirous to avail themselves of any advantage that may arise from the Certificates given them, on taking such Tests, that they are not brought to a suitable disposition of Mind to make an Acknowledgment for such their deviations; and that were any from true conviction in their own Minds of the necessity thereof, are made willing to return such their Certificates, friends might encourage and strengthen such therein, which is submitted to the Meeting 11th Month 10th 1780 by John Tatum Samuel Broime Edward Darnel Samuel Lippincott Aaron Howes John Hunt Thomas Redman Joshua Thompson John Collins Ebenezer Miller Enoch Evans"</note>  John Simpson, John Foreman, and James Wood was there and had a pretty deal to say.

Many remarks were made, I hope to edification. Next day we came to Monthly Meeting at Burlington which was a poor shut up time though may be profitable. Lodged at Aaron Wills’s. Had an opportunity with two young women and a young man. There was a door of utterance but not as I could find of entrance. Maybe it may be picked up another day. We came down to Holly. Called to see John Woolman’s widow who seems not like to continue long. Had a sitting with her rather to profit I hope. She seemed well composed in mind on our way home.

<div type="entry" date="1787-02-20">20. I went to Evesham Meeting appointed for the Thomas Colley and he preached a very notable sermon from this text: Be astonished ye heavens and be ye horribly afraid for this. My people have committed two great evils. They have forsaken the fountain of living waters and have hewn to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water [Jeremiah 2:12-13]. He spoke with life and authority and yet many were dull and even sleepy whilst he was delivering the most suitable pertinent doctrine to such a state.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1787-02-21">21. Thomas Colley was at our meeting and had an open time with a very large concourse of people. He begun with this awakening language (as he expressed it) of the prophet. Wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayst be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodged within thee etc. <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 4:14</note> 
Although he spoke with great strength and life yet many were very sleepy and dullness and ease greatly appeared especially amongst professors. It seems as if fruitless speculation and a lethargic stupefaction hath gained the ascendancy in too many. Oh the difficulty of reaching and rousing such a state. One of our Friends, I think it is [Thomas] Chalkley, says he was as much surprised with the approaches of such a state. Think of the worlds of the martyrs. Christopher Love in his prophecy points to a time when there should be a powerful preachers but dull hearers. See Eusebius works, They come before thee as the people cometh etc. the Stranger mentioned.</div>

Was our weekday meeting and after meeting an opportunity with the youth by the appointment of the Monthly Meeting to have the extracts with some other minutes of our Yearly Meeting read alluding to the unseemly custom of our youths' keeping company. Joshua Evans was with us and a down right good lively favored time. It was manifestly favored with the ownings of truth. <note resp="transcr">This meeting, “wherein the Youth may have the liberty of attending,” was appointed by Evesham Monthly meeting held 2mo 1787 following a report that the “meeting with Parents and Heads of Families” held 1mo 1787 was “agreeable” (Minutes of Evesham Monthly meeting, 2mo 1787).</note> </div>

<div type="entry" date="1787-03-23">23. Was Quarterly Meeting. Townsend had the chief service in the ministry. I think there was a travel and journeying forwards. That matter respecting young people running out and in disturbing the meeting was very smartly handled.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1787-03-24">24. Went to select meeting at Philadelphia. In answering queries John Townsend had good service respecting the education of children and keeping them to plainness.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1787-03-25">25. Was First Day. I attend the Market Street Meeting morning which a dull trying time though perhaps profitable. In the afternoon and evening they were to me hard laborious times though John Storer speak very excellent on this subject or text: The Lord's people shall be taught of him. They shall be established in righteousness and great shall be their peace <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 54: 13-14</note> . I believe it was a highly favored time with him and I think never heard a man speak better, though there was not a door of entrance that I could see and I believe it was not an open time with the people.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1787-03-26">26. I was at the Bank Meeting and it was a very grievous time. The meeting very much burdened with an unskillful forward ministry this afternoon. The select mee<pb id="A0011519_185"/>
ting concluded. John Storer took his leave or farewell and a most exceeding favored time he had in clearing himself to first the elder rank of ministers then to the middle-aged and to the younger class and also to the elders. In most endearing and very instructing language he said he felt the father’s love to be near and pressed diligence and faithfulness in the Lord’s work in every allotment to which we were called. Very close home to us. 
After signing certificates for the English Friends to return home, and one to send after Job Scott to the meeting where he belongs, the meeting adjourned.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1787-03-27">27. I came up to our meeting with Elizabeth Collins, John Collins and Rebecca Warrington. The meeting was silent nearly and but low.</div>

I had forgot Samuel Emlen this spring select meeting gave in an account of his journey to Barbados that they were very kindly received by the inhabitants and particularly by the governor of the island. He made mention of the great hurricane that was there in the year 1780 which turned over all Friends old dissolute meeting houses which were five in number, that they were now about building a new one. In this hurricane there was many hundreds killed. Some thought a thousand people lost their lives in it and Samuel Emlen said he believed some of them thought the end of the world was come.</div>

<div type="entry" date="1787-04-07">7. I went to the meeting at Cropwell appointed for Mary Stevenson and Mary Newbould. It was a very hard laborious time in the forepart but ended better.

After meeting Elizabeth Collins and Samuel Allinson and I went to visit Joseph Garwood and wife on account of his selling a Negro for term of life but it seemed to us he could not bear to let us see him, though he was then upstairs and said to be indisposed with bad fits – all the evasions that seemingly could be made to prevent our so much as seeing of him. So after laying things close home to his wife we left her, being satisfied in laboring to clear ourselves. And I had a hope there would be a service in our visits to the house for I found it brought the matter very heavy on them and I was much confirmed that the care and labor of Friends herein was right.</div>

This summer there have been several times a pinch with drought in the spring about planting time, then come on very wet. An uncommon season for clover. Then, about harvest the fields were much parched. Held dry till after hay getting was chiefly over, then came on wet and is now very wet. Corn very promising only backward, in danger of the frost. We hear it is dry in other places Virginia etc.
<pb id="A0011519_195"/>
Richard and Thomas Titus and I had some conversation concerning their wheat being destroyed on Long Island. Thomas told me that some years ago whither in the time of the wars, I think it was, there was a great scarcity of wheat and they raised the price to such extortion as to sell it for 6 dollars a bushel.*
[Left marginal note] *He said the magistrates were forced to regulate and set prices on the wheat and other things
And now for this 7 years past a fly they called the Hessian fly has destroyed their wheat so that they have not pretended to raise wheat, though a great wheat country. But Thomas said they could raise a sufficient Supply of other grain. Those flies have been observed to spread over the country about 15 miles a year.
Richard and Thomas inform us that at the time of the wars on their island there was a time of great scarcity and no prospect of a supply from any part. Many poor in a great straight and much pinched and at that time there came a vast quantity of fish (mackerel) so thick on the shore that their women could wade in throw out with their hands just what they wanted so that the island was filled or fully supplied with them. Oysters they found in their bay at that time where oysters were never found before nor are to be found there at this time.
[Left marginal note] They said those fish were very fat so as to need no butter to cook them.
This is really marvelous and miraculous. Some account I have had as I noted down of vast great quantities of fish being drove ashore on the beach at Egg Harbor, but they were dead and these were alive and so thick on the shore that they could not get out of their way as above hinted. The women threw them on shore with their hands as they pleased. And I think I have heard of an instance once at Shrewsbury like that at Egg Harbor on the beach.
[Left marginal note] The Israelites were fed with quails and manna, Elijah by ravens etc.
About this time 25 of this month I was informed by Isaiah Haines that a neighbor of his, a son of Reece Price, told his he had been up at a place near Jacobs Town lately and a certain man there rented a large farm, that he had planted between sixty and seventy acres of Indian corn and that a kind of insect had eaten round the roots of his corn till it had dwindled so that he gave over plowing it and said he would give the whole field to anybody that would give him thirty bushels of corn. Some other field or fields he said were effected in like manner.
It may be ten or twelve years ago people in our parts went to great expense in building great cider houses, apple mills, and screw presses and sitting great works in divers places building still houses and setting up great stills and great to do there was stilling of cider, but this six or seven years we have had no apples for cider. Scarcely enough for vinegar or house use. The stilling business is all done with. Still houses rotted down and left desolate. Some removed and converted to other use. Cider houses, presses and mills look desolate, rotting down and useless, and orchards, but a cumber to the ground as some have remarked. What little fruit we have had of late years has been little notte [knotty?] and sometime rot on the trees etc. </div>

However we came off with reputation and the people seemed pleased requesting another such a meeting. We dined at Isaac Borton's and had sitting which was satisfactory to me and may be of advantage to others.

Also Rebekah Pincher and Charity Cook from South Carolina Bush River. The meeting to me was but middling though the strangers had good service and especially Rebekah Pincher in last meeting on that of bringing up our families with us to meeting and encouraging them of our household whither they professed with us or not. It was indeed a most excellent sentence and she appeared to me to be a most pure piece of household furniture.

<div type="entry" date="1787-09-21">21. Sixth of the week. Was Quarterly Meeting but to me it was rather a place of striping. I was unwell; however I found others thought it a favored time. Daniel Offley was favored in prayer. The last or meeting for business seemed middling well but not very lively and open. By accounts the women had a very fine open tendering time. The strangers were favored in the meeting for business remarkably. O how many are the celestial showers with which we are favored of late! Remember what was said concerning the ground that drank in the rain and brought forth briers and the sinner that being often reproved.</div>
<div type="entry" date="1787-09-22">22. I went down to select meeting at Philadelphia. A solid good meeting. James Thoring ministered counsel to ministers not to hunt for openings or visions but keep to the life and simplicity: all centers here.

It was expressed by several Friends to be a most favored meeting they ever knew at that place, but for my part I cannot say so but<pb id="A0011519_199"/>
but there was indeed divers very lively much favored opportunities both in select meeting and in the Yearly Meeting, as well as in some of the meetings for Worship. The last sitting of the select meeting was really a very fine favored time. Ann Jessup appeared in prayer. Zacharias Dicks spoke, but Mary Husband exceeded all, though the others were favored. Mary’s testimony was chiefly to the elders encouraging them to faithfulness and to get out from home: Leave the bleatings of thy flocks etc. O it was most excellent.
A testimony was raised in the Yearly Meeting against many things which are frequently complained of in the queries but most particularly against the importation and retailing rum. Jacob Lindley said he had been informed from good authority that there was ten hundred thousand gallons brought into Philadelphia yearly. J.[acob] L.[indley] and Warner Mifflin did lay on heavy blows respecting that of retailing spirits. It seemed as they had got to laying ax to the root of the corrupt tree. Warner laid it on that retailing rum was in some sort worse than highway robbing. I think Isaac Zane gave in some account concerning the continuation of the import of Negroes, that there had been twelve thousand imported within this four years.</div>

4th of the Third Month, 1788. My wife, Abigail Stokes and I visited Darling Conrow his family, he being afflicted with the loss of the use of his limbs and his wife requesting to be joined to Friends with her children. Then we visited S. Longstaff, a young woman who had made request. Then we visited Phebe Burr confined with the consumption. And I think it was a day of favor in a good degree especially the last night.
6. We visited our school and came off well though close plain dealing was necessary. 
[Left marginal note] Darling said at parting he could not express the consolation he had in our company and was tender even to tears.
7. Was our Monthly Meeting. I met the committee on Negro cases. There appeared encouragement to labor with some not professing with us and Friends seemed under the concern and care of divers matter. Monthly Meeting came on and on the whole it was I thought a favored time. There appeared strength to go through the business in the authority of truth to good satisfaction. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1788: "Our Friend John Hunt laid before this meeting an engagement that had for some time attended his Mind, and of late had revised with increasing weight, to have a Meeting with the inhabitants at and near Longscoming, requesting our sympathy and concurrence therein, which was obtained; and he left at liberty to proceed therein as way may open, and Joshua Lippincott, John Collins, and Enoch Evans appointed to accompany him therein and report to this meeting when performed" and Negro Meeting appointed.</note> 
[Right marginal note] Turned out the spectators and favored strengthening time.
[Left marginal note] On review: in this week’s work this language was revived by my wife.
8. Was select meeting. Close scraping work was my lot. On the whole it was thought a favored profitable time. This morning we, that is my wife and I and Joseph Thorington and wife, went to see Isaac Haines’ family who is lame we had a sitting and a favored time. It was remarkably so with my wife,* in dealing close and plain with him and several of the children. His wife not at home.
[Left marginal note] *Great and marvelous are thy works O Lord
9. Was First Day. At our meeting, a full crowded meeting. One of our doctors came in with his hat in his hand and the magistrate with him and divers others seldom seen there, the Lord was pleased to favor us with victory over a light speculative state and a good solid meeting it was this afternoon we stopped at the house. The burial of Ephraim Stiles his wife who died very suddenly. Has some satisfaction came off middling well. 
10. At work at some plows.
11. Was our meeting. William Roberts and E. Grinslade was married and we had a great shower of strangers. R. Willis, Samuel Emlen, Nicholas Waln, William Savery and John Cox. We had a great deal of preaching and very good. Nicholas did give it to us soundly right down hum twang, truth triumphed.
12. About some plows.
13. Do. Afternoon I went to see John Hollinshead involved in great trouble thought to be in danger of losing his reason.
14. I went after a load of rails.
15. Dressing out plow. This [afternoon?] went to see Kain sick.
16. First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. The forepart was hard but after a hard tugging time it ended to my satisfaction so that it was no hardship to travel on foot.
17. About home at plows.
18. Went to our meeting. Had a sad time. Something the matter with me or some of my Friends. I could not get along. A sickening time.
19. At work at home.
20. Was our select meeting at Haddonfield. A poor low time as I thought.
21. Was Quarterly Meeting. We had a great deal of preaching but I thought it but a poor time. I proceeded towards Philadelphia with Solomon Gaskill, Thomas Scattergood, William Rogers and divers others. Thomas Scattergood, William R. and I stopped to see John Burroughs who has lately has his leg cut off and is very low, hardly like to recover. I thought we had a favored time with him and he expressed satisfaction with the visit.
<pb id="A0011521_003"/>
We went to Joseph Kaighn’s to lodge. Had a sitting with his brother’s family in the evening and another in the morning with his to some advantage I hope.
22 of the Third Month, 1788. Was select meeting at town which was solid and thought by the elders committee to be well conducted. I went this afternoon with Joshua Lippincott, John Collins, and William Rogers to see Leah Middleton, business which concerned our Monthly Meeting a close solid time. Here I saw the workings of the mystery of iniquity and the abominations that are in the earth, the seeds of desolation, and one of the strongholds of sin and Satan. It made me think of the Sodomites and sins of Sodom. We lodged at T. Scattergood’s.
23. Was First Day. After considerable struggling of thoughts about going to Frankford meeting, the way seemed to open clear for I to go and Deborah Basit to go with me. This is the place where Thomas Chalkley formerly lived near this meeting house. It appeared to be a poor little cold starved place, but few burden bearers, but Deborah had lively good service. But I could not please myself as at some times. We dined at John Roberts’s. Had a sitting to satisfaction and so returned to town and though we were caught in a shower, All was well and seemed right. This Deborah is a precious innocent sweet spirited creature and this time had a tendency to nearly and sweetly to unite us. 
This evening, I was at bank meeting. James Thornton and William Savery was highly favored, the last in prayer but it was a distressing time with me. Had taken some cold numbness and pain in the Head though I believe it was a highly favored time with many and mine ear received a little thereof before it was over. Lodged at Scattergood’s.
24. Select Meeting met again at 8. Committee reported as their sense the several public meetings were favored. A certificate was produced for James Thorington to visit Friends in Europe which was signed with great unanimity and freedom. Adjourned till three afternoon. Went to Pine Street. Debe Basset had good service. Likewise Peter Yarnall and William Matthews. 
Select Meeting met again. William Savery had most uncommon service, extensive council to ministers and elders. Likewise John Lloyd and Samuel Emlen. It appeared I thought that Friends were journeying forward, though poverty does so much abound in the little meetings up and down.
[Left marginal note] Relieved of the pain in my head remarkably.
25. Came up to our meeting on foot. Blind Solomon Gaskill, Abner Rogers walked with us. Thomas Vickers was at our meeting but was silent. I thought Solomon and I came off pretty well satisfactory.
<pb id="A0011521_004"/>
26th of the Third Month, 1788. Went to the burial of Darling Conrow. Solomon Gaskill went with us from Moorestown. I hope it was a pretty solid time and the more so for our being there, both having considerable to say at the house, one at the grave this afternoon. My wife, Joseph Warrington and I went to see Joseph Buzby, to all appearance near his end. We could have no conversation with him further than this, when we bid him fare well he had strength enough to call our names bid us fare well and said I wish you all well. 
[Left marginal note] Dined at Joshua Bispham’s. Had a sitting with the heads of the family to some relief.
27. Got home about noon and made greatest part of a plow for A. Nichol.
28. About home clearing new ground etc.
29. Do. Thomas Vickers was here and I went to show him the way to Theodocea Lippincott’s. At work at the new ground etc.
30. Was First Day at our meeting and I thought there was something pretty lively and smart for us. Rather gained ground I hope. We dined with the widow Grinslade and had a sitting with the family. Came off beyond expectation, with a degree of satisfaction.
Second Day Samme and I went to splice a pump for Phinehas Lord and put the pump into the new well. Due to me [crossed through with notation] paid 1-2-6 
{1788-04}
[1.] 3[rd day]. Went to make a pump for Jonathan Brown.
[2.] 4[th day]. At work at Brown’s pump. Put down Brown’s pump but it won’t tighten.
[3.] 5[th day]. We made a pump for William Keys 16 feet long. He paid part 7s[hillings] 6 and left [crossed through with notation “paid off” and symbols above] 1-4-0. 
[4.] Sixth [Day]. We took up Jonathan Brown’s pump and put it down again. His pump was paid for 36 feet long. All this pump, this week’s, work was done with cedar. Came home, stopped to see a young woman under great trouble about religious matters. Found all pretty well at home.
[5.] Seventh Day of the week at work at plow for Amos Haines and John Barton both paid.
6th of the Fourth Month, 1788. Having liberty and the united concurrence of our Monthly Meeting I appointed a meeting at Long–a-Coming. Joshua Lippincott, John Collins and Enoch Evans were appointed to bear me company. My wife went with me. The inhabitance met scatteringly which was a hurt and the expectation of the people a great deal too much outward. Afterwards, a spirit that I thought should be famished. Solomon Gaskill was there and had considerable to say but it was a lowish time with me. I could not feel that raised into dominion which my soul longed for, however I thought there was something at last a little lively and Friends concluded on comparing notes that the meeting ended well. I remember J.C. words were, well John, all is well that ends well. I believe there is a little remnant of well minded people there and divers expressed great satisfaction with the meeting. One was at our house a few days after and had a pretty deal to say about the meeting. Said he should be glad to have one every First Day there.
<pb id="A0011521_005"/>
7th of the Fourth Month, 1788. Making a plow for Amos Haines paid for.
8. Was our preparative meeting. A poor time with me. No satisfaction. I begin to think it is time to lay by.
9 and 10. About making a plow for Thomas Hollinshead and mending fences.
[Left marginal note] M X and C To P
11. Was Monthly Meeting. Negro Committee met this morning. Friends seemed under a good degree of care of the business but some cases like to suffer loss for want of time to attend. Monthly Meeting came on. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, April 1788: "Joshua Lippincott on behalf of the Committee appointed to accompany John Hunt in a visit to the Meeting at Longscoming, reported that the same had been performed to general satisfaction."</note>  
I thought the first sitting ended well and solid. Solomon Gaskill I thought spoke well. Elizabeth Collins appeared in prayer. And myself had something to say concerning building the house, that there was not the sound of an iron tool to be heard, neither ax, saw, or hammer. If thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it. 
However when business was entered upon, I think I have not seen of late more of the creaturely part in transacting the business. Hammering work. I am afraid we shall get so cunning we shant be able to do any thing to purpose. Council was darkened with too many words without knowledge, even about trifles. Not weighty in spirit. I am sick of it. Conclude it is time to lay by. No satisfaction. <note resp="transcr">Minutes of Evesham Monthly meeting, 4mo 1788).</note>  
Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord. <note resp="transcr">Judges 5:23</note>  Let condemnation be placed on all that doth not advance the truth. 
12. Making a plow for Thomas Thorn.
13. First Day. Went to our meeting. A tendering good humbling satisfactory time to me. The savor remained several days.
14. Went to Robert Bishop’s to make a pump 22 feet long he had the log hewed and we bored it and put it in when we settled he was 35 shillings in my debt, and I had fifty shad of him. At five dollars per hundred the shad---- 				  18 –9  [crossed out]

                                16 =3 Due to me 
[Later addition] Paid all off now.
15. Came up to our meeting a hard tugging time not much satisfaction.
[Left marginal note] My wife expressed it a favor to her very great
16. Trying mend Jacob Hollinshead’s pump. A troublesome job.
17. About home clearing a bit of new ground.
18. At work at new ground and about home etc.
19. About a plow for Amos Haines.
20. Was First Day. At our meeting. We conclude it was a pretty solid good meeting, a time of favor. This afternoon we went to visit Jonas Cattle’s family who is about to remove to Redstone. With this family we had a sitting with them to some advantage I hope.
21. About some plows, hauling rails etc.
22. At our meeting. John Haines and Elizabeth Hollinshead was married. The meeting was low forepart but ended lively and well, as I thought. A young woman – Langdale – from Philadelphia helped us out bravely.
23. Finished one plow for Benjamin Archer and one for William Cooper and after hay.
24. Went to make a pump for Samuel Webster at Timbercreek Abborsors place.
25. Finished the pump 25 feet long. Six dollars due to me. Came home and brought a load of rails from Amos Haines.
26. I was making a screw for Joseph Robert. Samme made a plow: N.H.
<pb id="A0011521_006"/>
27th Fourth Month. 1788. Was First Day at our meeting, but lowish. This afternoon was a meeting at Evesham for Blacks. John Simpson and Benjamin Swet was there. John had good service. The meeting advantageous and encouraging.
28. About home.
29. At our meeting – low though not unpleasant in the end.
30. At market. Went to a vendue there and had cause to repent it save that more care was necessary every way.
{1788-05}
The rest of the week about home.
4th of the Month. I went with William. Rogers, John Collins, and John Roberts to visit Mary Clements under dealings and had a pretty clever time. I went to Newtown Meeting. Thomas Scattergood and Arthur Howell was there. The meeting was very low forepart but ended better and Scattergood and Howell took me to do after meeting for being too backward and sitting in the way. This afternoon was a meeting for the Blacks which was a very low poor time as I ever have remember. The meeting was very much hurt by the ministry. A grievous time as I ever seen, sickening and sorrowful. T.S. was not there. 
Afternoon I went with Joshua Lippincott and Joshua Evans to visit Jacob Brown on account of holding slaves. He treated us courteously and manly. Had an open time with him. Though he did not at that time agree to take our advice, there was a hope the labor would not be lost. Many very pertinent hints were dropped to him and close remarks made and he seemed to have an ear to hear us which was satisfactory.
6. Was our preparative meeting things very low as I thought.
7. At work clearing a piece of new ground. 
8th. Do. 
9. Was our Monthly Meeting. John Parrish, James Cooper and wife and John Tatham was there. I think the first meeting was lively and ended well and the meeting for Business pretty lively and well. One case of M.C. was very straightening, some for accepting her and other for disown and returning acknowledgement. The tightest work I ever seen and know not how it will end.
10. Was Select Meeting. The above mentioned strangers were there. On the whole it was an open time and close searching work concerning some matters. We had at our last Monthly Meeting an uncommon number of cases concerning outgoing in marriage and fornication <note resp="transcr">Journal gives "unchaste conduct," 249.</note>  which seemed to much affect these strangers and they said it close on our select members to take under their care and get together and see if way would not open to enter into a labor with heads of families on account of the custom of young peoples keeping company, improper Indulgences and allowance of wrong things. Friends seemed to get und the weight of the matter and Fifth Day before our preparative meeting agreed on [it] to meet at Evesham.
<pb id="A0011521_007"/>
11th of the Fifth Month, 1788. First Day. At our meeting which to me was a favored strengthening time and I thought there was a good degree of quietude and solidity covered the meeting.
12. At work at a piece of new ground.
13. Went to our meeting which was a low time, though I had something to say which M[y] W[ife] T[hought] D[id] S[ome] G[ood].
14. Getting ready to plant. Had some trials amongst us, upon or after which Samme wrote the following lines which was found set upon the mantelpiece or door post. 
[not copied]
15:16:17. About home planting etc.
16. Was at our meeting, somewhat lonely. Friends gone to Salem Quarterly Meeting. I believe came off pretty well.
19.
20. At our meeting. Not to be complained of though might been much better. The remainder of this week about home. It was so wet we could not plant nor did not finish till the last of this week.
25 Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting. I don’t know that there was cause of complaint. Came off pretty well. At noon I went to brother Enoch’s and Samuel Allinson and E. Hope. I went to see Isaac Andrews on account of his sending word to our monthly meeting that he intended to appeal to the quarter. I had satisfaction in clearing myself and a hope of advantage to him.
26. At home.
27. About a cheese press.
27. Went to our meeting. I made a blundering hand of it but got along at last without loss. After meeting went to Joseph Warrington’s and to see Ruth confined to her bed.
28. At work at a cheese press.
29. Fifth of the week. I went to Evesham meeting. John Lloyd was there and all our select members. Elizabeth Collins and John had good service and I had good satisfaction and a favored good meeting. Select members had a sitting this afternoon to consider of the custom of our young people’s company keeping and what could be done to prevent our book from being so stained with account of outgoing in marriage, fornication and the like enormities. Friends seemed to be getting under the weight but no way open to go much forward as yet. Adjourned to meet this day month.
30. I set off to Egg Harbor Yearly Meeting with John Lloyd, Joseph Warrington, Enoch Evans, William Rogers and many others. Met on the road six or nine wagons. Was at a select meeting on Seventh Day the 31 which was a very dull beclouded drowsy time as ever I seen. I omitted, held back too much I fear. Lodged at Thomas Bilanges.
{1788-06}
1st of the Sixth Month. Was First Day. We were at their yearly meeting and came off very well. This afternoon I was at a schoolhouse meeting which ended well and to good satisfaction.
2. At the old meeting house. John Lloyd had good service. It was concluded the meeting was well conducted, satisfactory in a good degree to me. This afternoon was their monthly meeting. Things are low there, but I hope rising. Had sittings in divers families and returned in peace.
<pb id="A0011521_008"/>
3rd of the Sixth Month, 1788. I returned from Egg Harbor with Enoch Evans, William. Rogers, Charles West and a great many more in company.
4 and 5. At work at a cheese press for Joseph Burroughs.
6. Negro Committee met again monthly meeting morning. Request a release. A new committee is appointed: John Lloyd and Solomon Gaskill. John Cox was there. The first meeting ended well. Lloyd had good services but we had a troublesome job in the last meeting, tight work, different sentiments about Mary Clement’s case.
I think never before seen the aptness and danger of falling into rule and form. Time past, all that gave papers for outgoing in marriage were received, now all disowned. Let the state of men be ever so different if the life is not kept to. If we go at all, then rule or form is followed here. I believe many, not only individuals but whole societies, have fell and suffered great loss even after knowing great and good beginning. As William Penn mentions some who were for a time a burning and a shining light and being confident and confirmed their beginning was right, I believe many societies and sects of people have degenerated into the form without the life and so have been building up a babble from age to age and generation to generation and this I believe hath spread through whole nations. It is much easier to mankind or creaturely will to walk by form and rule than to keep to the dictates of the spirit of Truth within. Whilst we keep to that we have a safe guide but when we don’t keep to that, rule and form is directly sought for, and oh! what mountains of human inventions have men raised up of forms and rules in religion, which is but form and fruitless speculation!
7. Was First Day. Went to our meeting and was favored. When my wife asked me at night if I got any pay I could say yes.
8. About home.
9. Went to our meeting, no satisfaction, no pay. I hardly know what’s the matter. Made six plows this week: one for James Hale, Jacob Kay, Isaac Stiles, two [for] William Vinicomb, and Ezekiel Linsey, and tending corn etc.
15. First Day. Went to our meeting. Some sad blunders since last meeting day. Little ugly black clouds arose for want of more watchfulness. Not exemplary. My wounds stink because of my foolishness <note resp="transcr">Psalms 38:5</note>  yet after a dull suffering time forepart I thought the meeting ended pretty well and satisfactory. Yet perfection does not consist in teaching truth but in doing it. Because he is neither the greatest saint not the wisest man that knows the truth most, but he that practices it. 
[Right marginal note] The doers of the law shall be justified (Romans 2:13).
16. About home at work a cheese press for Sam Clements.
17. Went to our meeting. I had something to say, but low times though I hope rather for the better.
The rest of this week about home tending corn. About two plows for Joseph Stiles. I heard this week of people eastward grinding oats to make bread and of their making potato bread. The Hessian Fly and hard frost hath destroyed the wheat in many places especially eastward. I heard a letter read giving an account that the frost had been harder than any could remember in Chester County. The wheat killed, so that without a favorable summer they despair of bread. But wheat hath been low here, 6 s[hillings] bushel. What ups and downs. John Lloyd told me for six miles with [?] them hard is the seed of wheat.
<pb id="A0011521_009"/>
22nd of the Sixth Month was 1788. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. Poverty and lukewarmness, indifference and ease was complained of by the little preachers and one recommended a care not to rob God this afternoon by applying the time to please ourselves which is set apart for his service and for divine meditation, which I endeavored to practice in reading the Scriptures this afternoon and other good books but seem to have no appetite for any till most night. Tasted of one and of another till I found this in William Penn’s <italic>Select Works,</italic> page 250: 1. From Diogenes his constant scholar and Friend take this one very true and notable saying: of spiritual exercitation Laertius makes him speak to this purpose in his account of his doctrine, that where men’s souls are deeply and frequently employed in that spiritual retirement and waiting for divine strength and are after exercised in meditation upon the eternal mind, holy revelations, or illuminations will occur which enlighten the soul and enable it the better to like and act virtuously. Now see Isaiah XL: 31, and Psalms XXV and 14. After this I heaved ins of a dismal rock* which I have seen, nay got fast upon for a time many times before. Was favored to get off afloat again pretty soon.
[marginal note]*a stony heart
23. About home at work at cheese press.
[Left marginal note] Called to see Sarah Hamil, ill of the dropsy. Has sat in her chair three weeks.
24. Was at our meeting and thought it a favored time with me, strengthening and satisfactory. Went to mend M. Pipit’s pump. Heard of the death of Lydia Lamb an ancient Friend whose end was remarkable. She was helping to doctor or do something to a grandchild which was poisoned. It so fell out that a needle in her daughter-in-law’s sleeve pricked her arm and it soon began to be painful, swelled and mortified and killed her and in a few days. Some few months ago in that neighborhood or that way towards new mills I was told of a man that scratched his arm with a pin in his sleeve loading wood, and it killed him in a very few days. A Dutch man servant to Robert Stiles some years ago was whittling a bit of cedar one First Day morning making a plaything for one of the children, pricked his wrist with his knife, it soon mortified had his arm cut off but it killed him in a few days. Thomas A Kempis speaking of the uncertainty of time and the slender thread our lives seems to hang upon, says, which the least crumb or fly may put an end to. 
25. At work at home cheese press.
26. Went to the burial of John Hollinshead which was a satisfactory favored time with me at the grave. Joseph and Rebecca Roberts, Abraham Stokes and my wife and I went to Samuel Stokes. Had a sitting with the family which was I think in a good degree a favored time (and open). This John Hollinshead had got in debt, involved in difficulty, gave way to discouragement and so to despair and thought he was not worthy of the necessaries of life and so refused to eat and so starved three weeks and took nothing for part of the time but what they forced down him but eat a little before he died. It was thought that serving constable office was a great hurt to him. I think I scarcely ever saw a poorer corpse. He complained of no other disorder but trouble of mind. Starved to death.
[Left marginal note sideways] In 1794 L. Lamb’s son F. Haines died with a pain in his toe mortified.
<pb id="A0011521_010"/>
27 and 27. About home at work at cheese presses.
29. First Day at our meeting. A large crowded meeting I hope we came off pretty well. My wife thinks so. What a favor to be preserved above contempt.
30. Samme and I went to Mount Holly to make a pump for William Rossel 14 [feet] and a half long the new part, spliced 8 feet of the old one to it, comes to 34 s[hillings] and 7 which he paid off.
{1788-07}
1st of Seventh Month 1788. Went to Jacob Shavers in Holly to make him a pump 14 and a half long, paid for 13 now. Finished. He was not at home.
2. We took up a pump and bored it over again for George West and put it in order and mended one for Stacey Budd, and then went their preparative meeting. Things were very low and a dull poor time it was forepart yet I had no cause to repent being there. Went among the women and no loss but rather satisfaction in trying to do as well as I could. Muddy waters are sometimes better than none to a thirsty man and almost any kind of trash will do to throw in to stop a corrupt stream and I thought Friends seemed more near to me as if they owned me than heretofore at this place, but I thought I seen how poverty and formality abound amongst them. “Hold thy religion in the spirit,” said William Penn. See his preface to John Banks Journal in his new Penn’s <italic>Select Works</italic>. <note resp="transcr">William Penn, The Select Works of William Penn. 5 vol. London: James Phillips, 1782, vol. 1, p. clv.</note>  
This afternoon I went with Solomon Gaskill, Elizabeth Atkinson, and Mary West to visit Benjamin Bispham who seems in a poor state of health hardly like to recover. We had a sitting in the family and the service if there was any fell to me. I believe many pertinent sentences were dropped. It is thought by some he has hurt himself a tavern keeping and drinking to excess, but he now seems humble and willing to receive his Friends. Though time past refused to set with them. Came home with pleasantness this afternoon.
[Right marginal note] Benjamin Bispham died with a cancer in 1818.
3. My wife, Abbe Stokes and I went to Evesham meeting. The meeting was but dull and low but grew better. O how does a spirit of drowsiness beset our meeting! I think I never saw it to be such a monster before and so dismally dangerous. Our select members and overseers sat again to consider the case and custom of company keeping. A very low time forepart, but so we got to work. It grew better till at last it was a lively strengthing time. Adjourned till this day two months. Friends gave in lively satisfactory accounts of their labors and visits to divers families within the compass of each meeting, so conclude to attend as truth might open the way till we meet again in the Ninth Month next. Members of each preparative meeting agreed to meet on the occasion in two weeks.
4. I was at home making a pair of shelvings etc.
5. Went to Abram Warrington’s to splice a pump a new piece 12 feet long and boxes and 1-5-6 [with symbols above]. All settled and made even.
<pb id="A0011521_011"/>
6 of the Seventh Month, 1788. First Day. Read John Foxe’s <italic>Acts and Monuments</italic>, (brought one volume from Holly) Book of Martyrs: The Sufferings of Ridley and Latimer – their Godly conference in prison p. 365: says, “So that now we have no need to say who shall climb up into heaven or who shall go down into the deep to tell us what is needful to be done. Christ hath done both and hath commended unto us the word of faith, which also is abundantly declared unto us, in his word written so that hereafter if we walk earnestly in this way to the searching out of the truth it is not to be doubted but through the certain benefit of Christ’s spirit which he hath promised unto his we may find it and obtain everlasting life. should men ask council of the dead for the living faith? Isaiah: Let them go rather to the law and to the testimony etc. Christ sendeth them that he desires us to know the truth unto the Scriptures saying, search the Scriptures.” 
“remember a like thing well spoken of Jerome, ‘Ignorance of the Scriptures is the mother and cause of all errors,’ and in another place as I remember in the same author, ‘The knowledge of Scripture is the food of everlasting life,’” and a little after notes these words, “’Whatsoever things were written,’ saith Paul, ‘were written for our learning.’” This book or volume contains 959 pages in folio. My wife and I went to Haddonfield which was a very poor time. Warm weather, harvest time, people worked hard, and were very dull and heavy. I felt as if I had got on Mount Gilboa where there was neither dew nor rain nor fields of offering <note resp="transcr"> 2 Samuel 1:21</note> . We had an opportunity to some satisfaction with Hannah Griscom and then went their afternoon meeting. Low, low, low times here indeed. However I strove to encourage them of honest hearted and to stir up the negligent.
7. About hay and mowing etc.
8. Went to our meeting which was preparative meeting and it was a favored strengthening time. It seemed as if I could have run through a troop or leaped over a wall <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 22:30, Psalms 18:29 </note> .
9. About hay very wet weather.
10. Do. Do.
11. Was Monthly Meeting which was pretty well on the whole I hope, though I fear not altogether so clear of the creature as I should be.
12. About hay.
13. Was First Day at our meeting came off pretty well I hope. This afternoon in Foxe’s <italic>Acts and Monuments</italic>, page 773, an account of John Hunt and Edward [Richard] White, being in prison, as usual one evening went to prayer but could not utter a word but was overcome with great weeping and tenderness of heart, but the cause they knew not, but so continued a great space bursting out into tears. After that night as the morning come, the first word they heard was that the chancellor their great enemy was dead, the time of whose death they found to be the same hour when as they fell in such a sudden weeping. The Lord in all his works be praised, say the author. 
<pb id="A0011521_012"/>
14th of the Seventh Month 1788. About hay etc.
15. Went to our meeting. Robert Willis was there, had good service considering the meeting was very small harvest time. It was a strengthening time to me so that it seemed as if I could have went through the world and made my best Friend seem more near. A high favor. May it humble me, and keep me so.
The rest of this week we were getting in hay and grain etc.
20. Was First Day. My wife. R. Cowperthwaite and I went to Cropwell Meeting. Elizabeth Collins was there. My wife thinks it was a good lively favored time. After meeting a committee of men and women Friends had an opportunity with Sarah Lippincott concerning an acknowledgment she made to our meeting respecting outgoing in marriage with one too near of kin. Friends were favored to sift the matter and fix it in its proper place I believe. Dined at Theodocia Lippincott’s. A number of youth and other Friends being there, we had a sitting which at first was very low poor and dull, a tugging time, but it ended better. Some advice to the youth respecting company keeping may be of use and from information have cause to conclude it had. A satisfactory account. A testimony bearer in practice since that places.
21. About home.
22. At our meeting which was low. I had a purge given me which went down hard as it came. Rough about a little matter. Went to I. Warrington’s and some further on business. I informed sister Becke of what happened and she sent me this letter [not included].
This week was but an unpleasant time in worldly and outwardly. We were getting hay and the weather very catching and wet.
28. Was First Day. Went to our meeting and was taken with the ague and fever so could not sit half the meeting. Went to brother Joshua’s. Came home on a bed. Had one fit of the ague the Sixth Day before. Next day was better.
29. This day as I was raking hay – very catching weather, very wet- it came into my mind how that divers Friends’ families have been stripped of their children. 
See Ellis Pugh’s <italic>Salutation to the Britons</italic>, page [indecipherable]. It is there said three of his children died in one month in the flower of their age who from their youth walked orderly and hopeful. He mourned not as one without hope 1708. See Chalkley's <italic>Journal,</italic> page 265, in the year 1734, an account of his only son's decease. He was a lad much inclined to read the Holy Scriptures and other good books, especially religious ones etc. And see William Penn’s account of his son. Sorrow and joy in the loss and end of spring, Penn, page 51. He died in his one and twentieth year. See the excellent account of these youth’s 1696 and see James Gough <italic>Journal</italic>, page 117, an account of his oldest son, worth reading. He died soon after the 26 of the Tenth Month, 1769. A young man and bright example, a complete pattern in every virtue that (says the author) I have heard many in London and Bristol say they never saw one of his years like him. He is happily gone before safe, landed in the port of rest. 
Joshua Evans, his oldest son died about 21 years of age. On his death bed desired a pair of metal buckles that were carved brought to him and with a pair of pinchers broke them to pieces and threw them in the fire saying them things did not belong to Friends. Stacy Atkinson a young man near Moorestown on his death bed expressed a concern about the ruffles on the bosom of his shirt and now see William Penn’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 150.

Also pride, a warning to young people against it in the remarkable repentance of Susannah Whitrow, see Sewel's <italic>History</italic>, 766 page, and see the remarkable account of Isaac Shoemaker much like the above.. When Abel Thomas was here I was told he had his oldest son’s great coat who lately died a young man. Mark Reeve had a pious daughter died a few year ago about the time or rather before she arrived to the age of a young woman concerning whom a paper of memorial is in the neighborhood.
But what am I about here or where might I stop when I look round and consider what incitement to watchfulness and fear and humility! How many instances might be collected of not only youth being snatched away in the prime of life, but no age exempt from death, nor no station in the church (see Job I chapter and 19 verse) – parents from children and children from parents. There comes disorders about that strips off sometimes children almost and sometimes quite whole families and sometimes the parents. Instances: there have been many both being taken away near together, the pleurisy, fevers, the small pox, the measles, the sore throat and flux and perhaps numberless numbers of other disorders which far as I can see the best of people are not exempt from. William Abit died and Hannah Lippincott both of dismal cancer, worthy good Friends. I have been told that John Estaugh was stuck with the apoplexy once as he was speaking in Haddonfield meeting, but recovered it. But see a Collection of Memoirs, page 188, Robert Jordan was suddenly summoned with a fit of the apoplexy and from the account few ever better prepared or any that have been more industrious and more eminently engaged in their great Master’s cause.  <note resp="transcr">Journal as published in Friends Miscellany either quoting from a different version of the passage, or with sweeping editorial license replaces "I have been told that John Estaugh...Great masters Cause" with "How suddenly many are removed by apoplexy and other diseases!" 251.</note> 
[Left marginal note] Since I penned this I heard that about this time John Warrington’s house was struck with the thunder and only stunned him and several others and shattered the house some and Joseph Burrough’s house a few weeks ago.
O what, not only lists of such instances, but whole volumes might be noted and collected which loudly calls for humility fear and preparation.
But if we take a more extensive view and see how people in days past have been swept away by thousands in heaps in times of war in many ages and many nations. See 2 Kings 19:35: In the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and fourscore and five thousands smote in one night and see Isaiah 37:36. In the time of the plague in London how many thousands swept away? Near 100,000 they say, in a little time. Read now the 39 of Isaiah, the 12 verse to the 31 and again in another way, by way of persecution. See the 11 of Hebrews, 37 verse, They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted were slaid with the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute, afflicted, tormented. And of more latter time, since the time of Daniel and the tyranny in Rome, Shadreck, Masheck and Abednego and Nero’s days. But in Queen Mary’s reign how many thousands were burned and since the sufferings of Friends in New and Old England. O what a world of wickedness this is!

Well might David pray that the Lord would create a clean heart and renew a right spirit within him.
Now add to this consideration the murder of the many thousands of the poor Blacks. See John Woolman’s book, page 318, in their wars and bringing them from their native land.. And from good accounts the thousands that destroy themselves by drinking spirituous liquors, wretched men that are who shall deliver us for our state is like to that of standing on a sea of glass mingled with fire. Therefore blessed indeed is the man or set of men or nation whose minds is stayed on the Lord and whose confidence and hope and God the Lord is. <note resp="transcr">John Woolman, Considerations on Keeping Negroes: Recommended to the Professors of Christianity, of every Denomination.

I have heard years past some tell a little of the massacre in France but now I have the opportunity of seeing in Foxe, <italic>Acts and Monuments</italic> what dismal work there was. In Queen Mary’s reign about religion in England abundance were burned, racked, tortured, whipped and famished in prison and not only in England but in many other nations the like persecution and cruelty was committed. The author says in the conclusion of his narrative, page 931, Thus have we taken a view of the extreme afflictions and oppressions of the reformed churches in many parts of France wherein, within a few weeks well nigh thirty thousand were [illegible] put to death 1572. Next the author says, Now in the year 1573 many places where the faithful were fled for refuge, were assailed by open war. Namely, in the first place that of Sancerre, the history whereof you have here in a short view presented, in France being besieged with five hundred horsemen and about five thousand footmen. The 9th of January 1573 with their deliverance being (saith the story) compassed about with irreconcilable enemies 
<pb id="A0011521_015"/>
From about the beginning of April, the want of victuals having caused them to gather together all the asses and mules they had in the city, they were eaten up in less than a month. Then they came to horses, cats, rats, moles, mice and dogs. After these were spent they fell to ox and cowhides, sheepskins, parchment, old shoes, bullock and horses hoofs, horn and lanthorns, ropes and horse harness, leather girdles etc.
In the end of June the third part of the besieged had not bread to eat, such as could get hemp seed, ground it and stamped it in mortars and made bread of it. The like they did with all sorts of herbs mingling the same with bran if they had it. There they eat meal of chaff, nutshells and of state, excrements of horses and men. Yea the offal which lay in the streets was not spared. The nine and twentieth of July, a poor man and his wife were executed for having eaten the head, brains, and entrails of a young child about three years old which died of hunger, having made ready the other parts to eat at another meal. An old woman lodging in the house, eating a part of this mournful diet died in prison within a few hours after her imprisonment.
They were found guilty of other offences: but this aggravated the same the more all children under twelve years of age died, it was lamentable to hear the pitiful voices uttered by poor parents for the misery wherein their eyes beheld their languishing and dying infants.
To which purpose you may take notice here of a memorable accident a boy of ten years old being ready to yield up the ghost, seeing his father and mother weeping over him (whose arms and legs when they handled them, felt as if they had been dried sticks* said unto them wherefore weep ye thus, in seeing me famished to death? Mother said he, I ask you no bread, I know you have none: but seeing it is God’s will I should or must die this death, let us be thankful for it. Did not the holy man Lazarus die of famine? Have I not read it in my Bible? In uttering these and the like speeches he yielded up the ghost the 30th day of July.
[Left marginal note] Now see Lamentations 4:8.
That all the people died not of famine in the end of this month it was by reason of certain horses which were reserved for service if need should be, and six kine which were left to give milk for sustenance of young infants. These beasts were killed and their flesh sold for the sustenance or relief of such as were living, with a little corn, which by stealth some brought into the city, so that a pound of wheat was sold for half a crown.
There died by fight in Sancerre but eighty-four persons, but of famine more than five hundred. Many soldiers getting forth as they could out of the city flying from the famine chose rather to die by the sword of the enemy, wherefore some were slain, others imprisoned, and the rest put to death by the executioner. 
But when all help of men failed, the king having sworn he would make them eat up one another, the King of Kings delivered them by his wonderful providence, for at this instant the ambassador from Poland came into France to accept the Duke of Anjou for their king at whose entreaty (which could not well be denied) poor Sancerre, more than half famished was now set at liberty by raising the siege, who otherwise were determined to leave their bones there rather than yield themselves into their enemies hands. In regard they had often threatened them with a general massacre, whereas now, by the king’s appointment they were permitted to pass out of the city armed, if any would terry, that they should not be molested, having liberty granted them to dispose of their affairs as they pleased, with promises of conserving the honor and chastity as well of virgins as of women etc.
Now let us come to the city of Rochelle which being at this instant strongly besieged by the forces of France both by the sea and land, with about forty and fifty thousand men, was yet in the end also delivered, though not without many hot conflicts, by the immediate hand of God namely thus: the ambassador of Poland arriving in France the seventeenth day of June, a truce was made on the sudden, ar<pb id="A0011521_016"/>
ticles of peace drawn and sent to the king who consented to them and sent answer in for an edict granting to those of Rachel, Montauban, Nismes and others which stood upon their defense, liberty for the exercises of their religion, the rest to live peaceably in their houses and therein to minister the sacrament of baptism and marriage as they had want to do, so as their assemblies exceeded not the number of ten besides the parents.
He restored to Rochellers and others the rights and privileges, letting fall all the decrees given out against approving of their defensive war, giving them leave, according to their ancient custom to retain in their cities, towers and fortresses men and munitions, yea to receive in governor among them provided that they were such as they had no cause to suspect or except against.
By virtue of this edict, upon the tenth of July about ten of the clock in the forenoon, the Sieur of Biron entered into the city at the gate called de-Coigne, with an herald of arms, and four of the kings’ trumpeters, at which hour peace was proclaimed in the most eminent places thereof accompanied with the lieutenant of city and with the lord of villiers after which dining at the major’s house he soon after retired, being conducted along till he came without the city.
The same day many small vessels laden with biscuits, corn, meal, fish, and other provisions entered into the haven. 
At this siege the Duke of D: Amaule lost his life, with Cosseins who had broken into the admiral’s lodging and began the massacre at Paris, besides many great lords, gentlemen, captains, lieutenants, ancients to the number of threescore the great part of which having their hands imbued in those others massacres, being come thither received their reward. Namely either present death or wounds so incurable or wounds so incurable that they escaped not with life.
[Left marginal note] See 2 Chronicles 22 and 28 Joshua slew princes of Judah
One* thing ought not here to be passed over in silence, to wit, the provision of victuals which God furnished this besieged people with all when all other provisions began to fail them, namely an infinite number of small fishes never seen before in that haven, which every day yielded themselves to the mercy of the necessitous inhabitants. But as soon as the edict was published and the Rochelers set at liberty by the arriving of the Polish ambassadors, these sea fish withdrew themselves. 
[Left marginal note] see Exodus 16:31, Numbers 11: 31-32, Psalms 10: 5-40: Account of the quails the Lord sent to sustain Israel.
Although this relation following, touching another siege of this city of Rochelle suits nothing at all with the order of time, happening as it did in the year 1628, yet for as much as it seems to me to have some affinity with the terrible famine, wherewith both the City of Sancerre and it were affected, let not the reader be offended for placing the same here somewhat out of place being a thing so worthy of note:
An extract of a letter written on board the Saint George his Majesty’s ship in Saint George’s Islands.
There died in this siege of Rochelle the 30 of October 1628 sixteen thousand persons. The rest endured a world of miseries, most of their food being hides leather and old gloves other provisions being very scarce were at an excessive rate: viz. a bushel of XX Ii. A pound of bread XX s[hillings]; A quarter of mutton vi: 18 old money; a pound of butter XXX s[hillings]; an egg VIII s[hillings]; an ounce of sugar II s[hillings] vi d[pence]; a dried fish XX s[hillings]; a pound of grapes XII s[hillings]; a pint of milk XXX s[hillings]. Also it is reported, that through the famine young maids of fourteen or sixteen years of age did look like old women of a hundred years old. The famine was such that the poor people would cut off the buttocks of the dead as they lay in the church yard unburied. All the English that came out looked like anatomies. They lived two months mice frogs being all spent. And this with a world of other miseries did they suffer, in hope of being relieved by others. Thus much I thought good to let you understand
[Left marginal note] Read the 6 and 7 chapter 2 Kings: Ass’s head and dove’s dung sold.
[Right marginal note] See 2 Kings 6:25: Doves dung sold in siege Samaria.
<pb id="A0011521_017"/>
Now it is likely many would hardly believe this account, but let us a little consider that the scriptures testify concerning such thing. See 2 Kings 6:2, And it came to pass after this that Ben Hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up and Besieged Samaria and there was a great famine in Samaria and behold they besieged it until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and the fourth part of a Cab of doves dung for fives pieces of silver, and as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord a king and he said if the Lord do not help the whence shall I help the out of the barn floor or out of the wine press, and the king said unto her what aileth the, and she answered, this woman said unto me, give thy son that we may eat him to
day and we will eat my son tomorrow, so we boiled my son and did eat him and she hath hid her son. But see in the next chapter 7th 2 Kings how remarkably they were delivered.
Now see Jeremiah lamenting Jerusalem’s misery, Lamentations Chapter 11:19: Arise, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watch pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street. Behold a Lord and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit and children of a span long. Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord. 4 chapter 9 verse: They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger for these pine away stricken though for want of the fruits of the field. 10: The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children. They were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
Now see in early time this was threatened in Deuteronomy 28 chapter where we may see blessing promised for obedience and curses for disobedience. 52 verse: And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced wall come down wherein thou trustest. 53: And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters which the Lord thy God hath given there in the siege and in the straightness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee. Read 58 verse and 59 verse following aye the whole chapter. 
We read in Ezekiel 14 and 21 of four sore judgments: the sword, the famine, the noisome beast and pestilence, but as John Woolman remarks our land hath not yet been visited with famine as other nations in ages past. Although we have had broad signs and threatening prospects of it many times divers ways and especially in some besieged places in the times of the last war, we have as yet but had a taste of these things in comparison to what hath been known in scripture. I think there is above fifty places mention made of famine and between thirty and forty of pestilence. Although the stroke was heavy on many last war, in many places great desolation. Many thousands lost their lives one way or other many forced into exile to Nova Scotia. But how we forget it.

It appears from some chronological accounts of curious inquirers who have taken a view of the bulk of mankind as a family at large that the human species rather increase than decrease, notwithstanding the number that are and have been destroyed by wars and removed by death other ways and that upon the best computation that those curious ingenious inquirers are able to make of the number of mankind now on the globe. (And as was mentioned by the prophet, All flesh is as grass which withereth and one crop dies and gives way for another <note resp="transcr">1 Peter 1:24</note> , so it is with mankind one generation passes away and another comes.) These searchers and calculators have concluded on the whole that consequently eighty one thousand seven hundred must die and six two die every day.
John Foxe the author of the <italic>Books of Martyrs</italic> hath these word at the conclusion of his 3rd volume, page 959, which he terms a true declaration of the massacre of Voltolines.
“Therefore it appeareth most clearly every way that the aforesaid persons underwent those sufferings for no other cause, but only for the truth of the Gospel even as by the eternal decree of God, the holy prophets, Saint John Baptist, the holy apostles, yea even our Lord, and head, Jesus Christ himself and after him those many millions of the elected martyrs in all ages have done before, and especially in these miserable last times in Germany, France, England, Scotland, low Countries, Bohemia, Italy, Spain, Portugal etc. “
[Right marginal note] 20 of the Twelfth Month, 1789. I have an author [Arthur] O’Leary, <italic>[An Essay] On Toleration, </italic>says, page the 8th persecution has thinned the world of fifty millions of human beings.
Which martyrdom they endured willingly, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer blame for the name of Christ Jesus remembering the promise of this our Lord, blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs. Blessed are you when others shall revile and persecute you and shall falsely speak all evil of you for my sake. Rejoice and triumph, for your reward is great in heaven for so have they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
Read to this purpose, 1 Peter 4:12-16 which word of all good Christians are to be well pondered and weighed. For first by such trial we perish not. Secondly we are thereby made conformable to Christ our Head. Thirdly such sufferings cause unto us greater joy than sorrow. Fourthly they are infallible marks that the spirit of God rests upon us. Fifthly they manifest to all our unfeigned love to Christ and his Gospel. Sixthly, hereby we have good proof that the Lord doth correct us, not as a severe judge but as a loving and most tenderhearted father to whom therefore with his blessed son and Holy Spirit be all glory and honor ascribed in all the churches of the saints, world without end. Amen.
Book of Martyrs, page 488, John Philpot’s Martyrs <note resp="transcr">Philpot is one of the martyrs. In examination he was asked how old his religion was. Answered it is older than yours, a thousand years. The examiner says, I pray you, where was it fifty years ago? Philpot says, It was in Germany apparent by the testimony of Hus, Hieronymus of Prague and Wicklif [sic</note>, whom your generation an hundred years ago and more did burn for preaching the truth unto you and before their time and since hath been, although under persecution it hath been put to silence. And then next he alludes to the passage where it is mentioned that the true church should be driven into the wilderness and suffer great persecution. This reference to John Philpot’s testimony in 1555 as recorded in John Foxe’s Acts and Monuments; this book was frequently reprinted and the edition used by Hunt has not been identified.]

3rd of the Eighth Month 1788. Was First Day. I having been very poorly with the ague and fever several days and yet very weak. The morning wet and my wife sick with the chill and fever. I concluded not to go to meeting, till about ten o’clock it slacked raining. After a close near trials about being late, I got along and a favored time it was. I like to lost or forgot all my weakness both of body and mind till I came off. R.R. asked me how I was and I told her very poorly. Oh, said she, thee gets strength by coming out amongst thy Friends. A satisfactory opportunity.
4. About home but poorly.
5. Was our preparative meeting. I had a choice in sitting still but have been doubtful I was too much my own carver which tended to poverty in the first meeting. After meeting with Humphrey Owin I had an opportunity with a young man under dealing. After meeting I went with John Warrington to visit George Conrow by appointment of our Monthly Meeting.
6. John Collins, Rebekah Roberts and her daughter R.C. and I visited Charles French’s family on account of the custom of the youth’s company keeping – which was a favored lively time. Then we went to Joseph Roberts. Had a sitting with his family which was very low at first but ended pretty well. From thence to William Matlack’s which was a hard tugging time. An opposing spirit to be felt, however we tried to do as well as we could.
7. About home going to mill and sundry other little matters.
8. Was our Monthly Meeting. Hannah Reeve and Deborah Basit on their way homewards having been to the eastward ever since our Quarterly Meeting in the spring was there and Joshua Evans and William Bradaway, companion for the women Friends. The women Friends was very large in their public service, had a great deal to say. The meeting for business was a smart lively time. Joshua Evans and I went in amongst the women and it was a scraping time chiefly respecting the conduct of our youth in company keeping, outgoing in marriage, fornication, and the improper indulgence and allowance of wrong things and that of the use of the spirituous liquors, private dram drinking and retailing strong drink. Abundance of these things now uncommonly prevail.
[Left marginal note] Hannah Reeve with the palsy reduced to a child’s state. Now in 1806 Deborah Basit dead two years ago
9. This afternoon Joshua Evans was here and we went to Cropwell to a meeting appointed for Hannah Reeve and Deborah Basit who had a great deal to say which I hope will be of service to many.
10. Was First Day. Mark Reeve* and his wife Deborah Basit and Thomas Vickers was at our meeting Hann Reeve did most of the preaching in the forenoon. Mark appointed a meeting in the afternoon.

14. I was at Newtown Meeting appointed for Hannah Reeve and Deborah Basit who had a great deal to say.
15 and 16. About home wet weather.

17th of the Eighth Month, 1788. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Robert Willis was there and I thought we had a smart lively good meeting. After meeting we went to Samuel Burrough’s to dine. Joshua Lippincott, Enoch Evans and wife was there. We had a sitting which as far as I know was pretty well. Robert had a pretty deal to say.
18. About home.
19. Went to our meeting through a most uncommon hard rain. The waters so high it looked dangerous crossing the Brieds the water being over them. The meeting was very small and lowish. The rest of this week I was about home about some plows etc. Samme and Job made a pump for Japhet Garwood 16 feet long, paid for it all even.
24. Was First Day. We went to our meeting which was a favored time with me. After meeting my wife and Joseph Warrington and I went to Joseph Busby’s. 
25. We went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting at which was a large number of ministering Friends from different quarters. It was thought to be well conducted but I thought I seen a great room for improvement. Our monthly and quarterly meetings is too much taken up with preaching which lays waste or does not give time for the discipline and to dip into the state of society I had something to do amongst my Friends and came off well. We went to Aaron Wills to lodge.
26. Went to their youth’s meeting at Burlington. W. Matthews and Daniel Offley was chief speakers. This meeting was to the reputation of the society. Came home this evening.
27. Went to make a pump for John Stokes doctor. Settled of 29 feet, 6 inches [Crossed through] long and boxes.
28. My wife and I went to Evesham Meeting which was to me and I believe some others a low laborious time though she says it was a favored time with her. This afternoon Friends met according to adjournment to further consider the case of company keeping amongst our youth and what was for us to do in laboring for a reformation in that respect and Friends gave in satisfactory accounts of their care labors and visits therein, then adjourned.
29. I went to Jacob Hollinshead’s to put a new bottom piece to his pump.
30. At J.H. finished.
31. Was First Day. Went to our meeting which to me was low at first and I thought I labored after a state of true resignation. My wife says the meeting ended well and I came off with a good degree of satisfaction, a favor.
{1788-09}
1 of the Ninth Month. I was finishing a plow for William Roberts etc.
2. Was our preparative meeting. Joshua Evans was there. A poor low time it was. Answering our queries is very dull work. I having a concern for some time to visit the retailers of strong drink mentioned it to my friend Joshua and he agreed to go with me.
3. We proceeded to an old Scotchman at Sam Evan’s schoolhouse who sold rum to them men that murdered the widow Jenkins some time ago, but he was not at home. Then we went to Upper Evesham Preparative Meeting, which was a poor low time answering queries as I ever seen though in the first meeting of worship we came off middling well. Then went to John Riley’s who has a still house and store for rum but he was not at home.
<pb id="A0011521_021"/>
4. [Later addition above:] his wife died a few years after. We proceed to Joseph Edwards, a retailer of rum. Had a solid opportunity with him and his wife and they seemed to have ears to hear. Next to Richard Edwards is a retailer of spirituous liquors and had a seasonable time with him and his wife. Both of these expressed satisfaction with the visit. Then we went to Mount Holly Monthly Meeting which was a very poor low time. Nothing to be done seemingly to much purpose though some of our elders say maybe they will remember some of the hints and pick it up another day after meeting. We had an opportunity with William Sleeper and his wife respecting their selling rum. [Added later:] He died in 1793 at Otego<italic>.</italic> They appeared open to receive us and we left them with satisfaction. Then it so fell out that we had an unexpected opportunity with a young man, a retailer that lives at Juletown who came to Holly for a hogshead of rum and molasses. He likewise appeared open to hear advice and said he was obliged to us. Then we had a pretty good opportunity with some young women in George West’s family. Then came to Joseph Engle’s to lodge.
5. This morning we had a sweet opportunity in a sitting with their family. Then we went to visit Benjamin Borton a distiller of cider. We had a full opportunity to clear ourselves and they or he at least expressed satisfaction with the visit. Then we came to our Monthly Meeting which was a good solid meeting and pretty well conducted.
6. Was our Select Meeting which was but low forepart but ended better. I have been long pained on account of answering our queries and much confirmed in my mind at our superior meetings that a superficial form of answering queries hath been years past fallen into and although our Yearly Meeting hath of late closely pressed it on inferior meetings to send honest explicit answers but our elderly Friends seem as if they cannot bear to leave the old form and here I have been closely pinched. 
I had almost awhile like to have give out, but endeavored to ease my mind and it made a way and a down right close scrapeing battle we had and I came off with satisfaction. <note resp="transcr">Journal adds "May others be faithful," 252.</note> 
I remember some words of Samuel Neale from Ireland at our meeting. Said we have a little sister etc. What shall we do for her in the day that she shall be spoken for? If she be a wall we will build upon her a palace of silver, if she be a door we will enclose her with boards of cedar and spoke encouragingly to some and said if their bow abode in strength, their branch should grow over the walls of opposition, now to the king’s gate, as Mordecai and Daniel sat at the king’s gate. <note resp="transcr">Genesis 49:22-24</note> 
7. Was First Day. Went to our meeting a very stormy day. A small meeting but a choice good one to me. A favored time. My wife and I went to a Negro meeting this afternoon which was but small but much favored. A lively time.
8. About home.
9. Went to our meeting [illegible] came and the tavern John Cox and wife about their selling drink to those whose families suffer to good satisfaction.
[Left marginal note] To good satisfaction. The said they were obliged to us.

Ninth Month the 10:11:12 and 13, 1788. I was about home. Made several plows. Samme and Job made pump for the widow Lad, 21 feet and one a few weeks ago for Jophet Garwood 16 feet long.
14. Was First Day which was low forepart but ended better I hope.
15. About getting home plow stuff.
16. Went to our meeting which was a strengthening time of favor to me. The rest of this week I was about home getting plow stuff, doing something at a bedstead and sundry things.
21. Was First Day. Went to our meeting. A large full crowded meeting of various persuasions and some Methodists. I think the meeting ended well or at least satisfactory to me.
22. About sowing.
23. Went to our meeting. A very poor time I had of it. Some little cross occurrences before meeting put me out of sorts, however, I thought I got pretty calm and settled in meeting but something was the matter somehow, either the conduct of a man passing by the door and then stopping at the window put me out or something else. So it was I thought I made out but poorly. Came home sick of myself and stripped of all my clothing. I was this afternoon with John Col. and John Roberts trying to settle a difference, to little purpose except clearing ourselves it was to be feared, at D. Benevill’s.
24. About home sowing etc.
25. Was our Select Meeting at Haddonfield which I thought was but low the forepart. John Simpson was there and we had some searching work at last, I hope to profit. Job and Elizabeth Collins came home with me.
26. Was Quarterly Meeting. A large concourse of people but it was a poor time in my apprehension. Nothing near as well as Burlington Quarter a few weeks ago though John Simpson had good service and spoke well to divers matters in the last meeting. This evening I went to Joseph Burrows with John Simsons, Phillip Dennis and divers private Friends from Salem and Greenwich was there. It was low stripping time with me but we had a sitting in the evening and I thought of use to me and perhaps to the family.
27. Went to Select Meeting at town which was to me but a poor time. Rebecca Wright had lively service and it might be a good solid time to some. Samuel Emlen spoke very largely on the subject of the youth and liberties in their dress etc. Came home this evening.
There is at this time an alarming prospect something like a threatening of scarcity of bread. The Hessian fly have come thick in great armies. John Simpson says many reaped none and he got not more than his seed of wheat. Last harvest I had conversation with Friends at this time from Pennsylvania and Maryland who gave account of their sick wheat. A kind of blast or rust struck their wheat this wet season and produced a small red grain and made the people sick and vomit that eat it. A Friend told me that he had tried the dog, the fowls and the hogs and they would not eat of it, that they would take it in their mouths and put it out again, that it lay in the hogs’ trough several days and they would not eat it. Now how have our foolish nation for the sake of gain sent out the wheat to sea and had rum in exchange which make so many sick and vomit. O that we could read this! <note resp="transcr">Journal expands "Oh! that we could read the language of Divine Providence in these things!" 252.</note>  
<pb id="A0011521_023"/>
28th of the Ninth Month, 1788, Was First Day was at our meeting and came off bravely. I believe a good strengthening time to me. Went Philadelphia next morn.
{1788-10}
5th of the Tenth Month 1788. I was at our meeting which was to good satisfaction though I had a pinching trial this morning which I did not stand as well as I could wish.
6. About home.
7. Was our preparative meeting. A very stormy day. The meeting small. For a beginning from one we had this language: Be still oh ye Isles and let my people know their strength. O that we might know our minds brought into stillness by the influence of the Holy Spirit. And I thought it come as if she had some acquaintance with that Spirit. Come off pretty well the first meeting, but in the last it was a sorrowful shameful time. Our elderly Friends got uneasy about the new method of answering queries and a sad fretting time not fit to do anything.
8:9. About home. A sweet time, a time of love and Divine favor.
10. Was our Monthly Meeting. I met the Committee on Negro Cases at 9 hour. Friends seemed pretty well under the care of their business and expressed gladness that I was with them, though not of their committee at this time. Monthly Meeting came on. I thought the first sitting for worship we came off pretty well and J.C. thinks so too. The meeting for Business to me was not so lively as our last month. Some might far better and think otherwise.
11. I went to mend a pump for D. Benevil at Moorestown.
12. Was First Day at our meeting. John Hustton and Isaac Kersey from town was there, young preachers. Come off middling well I hope. This afternoon I went to see my beloved friend Joshua Evans, very ill of the bilious colic but seemed to be getting better.
13. This morning we had a sitting in his room with the family to profit I hope. Joshua expressed great satisfaction with my company and appeared to be much favored with a composed resigned mind at parting. I said I hoped he would be spared a while longer with us and that his affliction would tend to his further refinements. He answered and said he had not felt afraid to die and felt peace of mind which had supported and enable him to bear his great pains and expressed the value of that peace at such a time that it was more than all this world could afford and expressed the clear sight he had of the looking too much to doctors at such a time what a tendency it had to unsettle the mind.
I came up to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting which was a shut up time with me but grew better at last.
14. Went to our weekday meeting. Isaac Zane was there. I thought the meeting was but lowish, however not the worst. After meeting a number of Friends stopped to consider of the case of company keeping. The matter and business seemed to go on but dull and heavily.
15:16:17. Making an apple mill at home.
18. I went to Joshua Hunt’s to mend his pump. A very troublesome job. 
<pb id="A0011521_024"/>
19th of the Tenth Month 1788. Was First Day. Went to our meeting and through unspeakable favor I don’t know but that we came off very well and that we had a good solid meeting.
20. A very stormy day.
21. William Coat’s child was buried at our meeting. The meeting was but low. I thought I made out but poorly.
22. Husking corn etc.
23. I set off towards Shrewsbury. Was at Evesham Meeting which was very dull at first and grew worse and worse (through my backwardness) for a time but ended better. This afternoon William Rogers and Thomas Lippincott and I went on to my uncle John Harvey.
24. Set forward toward Shrewsbury. Fell in company with John Lloyd and divers others Pennsylvania Friends. We rode through Freehold, as it is called where there was the large farms and fields that ever I seen in my life by far. John Lloyd said he had seen those fields at this time of year covered with wheat and fat cattle, but now there is very little seed for harvest put in and but little Indian Corn. The Hessian fly amongst the wheat and the worms and lice amongst the Indian Corn seems to have laid this country desolate. Their farms in miserable fence and the timber very much destroyed and gone. Freehold being much inhabited by the Dutch, it was thought that their intention was to fence their farms with hedge and white thorn. Some of thorn I seen but a death amongst the hedge a few years ago cut off their prospect that way so that this with these armies of reptiles, flies, lice, frost and blasting spreads a melancholy prospect, for they have no wheat but what they get from York. We lodged at Edmund Williams.
25. We went to Select Meeting at Shrewsbury which I thought was but low, yet ended more lively. Things seem low in that spot, but from Hardwick and Rahway there is a valuable number of Friends belonging to that Quarter and I believe the strangers had service amongst them. This afternoon William Rogers and I were invited to sit with a number of Select Members, a committee on Schools. They seemed under a lively concern but have as yet got forward but little. We lodged at Joseph Wardel’s.
26. Was First Day. The meeting at Shrewsbury was very large and heavy at first but Sarah Lunde and John Lloyd were favored. We went down to the shore and crossed Shrewsbury River to lodge with Robert Hartshorn, an elder and father in the church. We went this afternoon atop of a very high mountain where we had a prospect of the great ocean whose waters came to the foot of the vast high steep mountain. We stood on after we came down. This evening we had a sweet opportunity with the family. Sarah Lunde, a worthy minister and her husband being with us and was much favored. After we went to bed I remembered a dream I had a few weeks ago. I dreamed that I was got on an exceeding high mountain and looked down and it seemed awful to see a great lake or water. With several other things, nearly as I saw in the dream seemed to come to pass.
27. We went to the Quarterly Meeting which was lively and satisfactory to me. We lodged at Benjamin Curliss. Had a solid sitting in the evening. Jacob Lunde and his wife was there and she was much favored.
28. Went to the youth’s meeting which was a solid good meeting. Thomas Scattergood and John Lloyd was much favored in the exercise of their gifts. We went to William Tiston’s to lodge where we found a large number of Friends with whom we had a favored sweet sitting in the evening. Jacob and Sarah Lunde was there. We parted with great nearness and satisfaction.
29. Set homewards. Dined at Thomas Middleton who is blind. We had a pretty good sitting with them and came to David Ridgeway’s to lodge.
30. Had a good opportunity in a sitting with them, then came home and found all well.
31. About corn etc.
{1788-11}
1st Eleventh Month. Do. Do.
<pb id="A0011521_025"/>
2nd of the Eleventh [Month], 1788. Was First Day. We had a very full crowded meeting and a highly favored time it was with me than ever, in treating with those that are like the dispersed and scattered, an uncommon number of which was there.
3. About corn etc.
4 was preparative meeting which was much better than last month. Got along pretty well.
5. Went to the burial of Ruth Packer. Our Friends Aaron and Joseph and their wives and Robert Willis was there. We had a meeting which ended well. Went to the house to Joseph after burial and Robert had a good service amongst us and I thought it was a time of favor and satisfactory.
6. Plowing and sowing etc.
7. Went to Monthly Meeting. Joseph Potts and James Wood and John Wilson was there and a highly favored time it was. My wife thinks it was the most favored time she ever seen there, the most favored day she ever seen in her life and I think I never seen the men and women part to go on business with more solemnity. It was really a solemn time. Joseph had weighty service. He and I went in amongst the women and had close labor.
8. Was our Select Meeting. First part was dry and barren but it ended better yea quite a lively searching good favored meeting, the clerk minuted it so, however; the fruits of honest labor.
[Left marginal note] At this Select Meeting our elders were free to say in our answers that we are favored with a lively edifying ministry, a fine thing if it does but hold.
9. Was First Day. I think there is latterly an improvement in the still quiet solid manner of the sitting of our First Day meetings if it does but hold.
10. About home. Samme lies very ill of a fever but is favored with a resigned mind, and most easy not to apply to a doctor saying many run to the doctors because they know not where to stay their mind and fix their dependence. I had one evening some solid conference with him. He said if the fever continued it would soon fetch him down. I said there was not much in this world to tempt us to stay here he answered, O! no the greatest in the world would not tempt me (not that alone). My way, says he, has been much shut up of late. It seemed as if I could not see far before me. I have been concerned to get something in this world but I think I never craved much, yet maybe too much. It is a great thing to be resigned in everything. I said I hoped there was not much in his way if it should be so ordered that he should be taken from us. He mentioned some weaknesses that had attended him but said he felt nothing to lay heavy on his mind but said he was much resigned though said maybe I am insensible. He mentioned the sick soldiers some years ago and said poor creatures, poor creatures we are and afterwards said he had endeavoured to conduct right of latter time.
11. Went to our meeting, through a most violent rain and wind. The rest of this week I was about home making cider etc., corn etc. Samme got some better.
16. Was First Day. Went to our meeting which was pretty well I thought.
17. About home.
18. Went to our meeting. I. Zane was there and came home with us.
19. Hauling out dung etc etc. Samme grow much worse but much resigned.
<pb id="A0011521_026"/>
20 of the Eleventh Month 1788. Isaac Zane, my wife and I and Rebekah Cowperthwait went out to visit divers families. Was at Isaac Lippincott’s which was an open favored time, then to Joseph Morgan’s which was a low hard time but ended some better.
21. I went to the doctor for Samme he being very ill of a fever.
22. I was hauling our manure on the grass ground.
23. Was First Day. I was at Cropwell Meeting with Isaac Zane, which after a time close labor I thought was a very favored meeting (to me at least).
24. I was out with Isaac Zane visiting several families, Joseph Stokes’s and John Smith. The first I thought was a favored good opportunity.
25. Went to our meeting which was to my relief and satisfaction.
26. About home. Samme continues very ill of a fever.
27. I was at Evesham meeting. A poor time I had of it and no wonder. Robert Walker’s advice was not taken (which was to go to master for breakfast before we go out to work) but quite the contrary. Oh the need there is of more watchfulness and fear lest the enemy trip up our heels.
28. William Rogers and wife came to pay us a visit.
29. My wife and I went market we have had an uncommon long spell of wet dull weather but warm.
30. Was First Day went to our meeting which at first was low and I had like to over stayed the tide however it ended with a very satisfactory to me and I believe to my Friends. John Collins very pleasantly gave me his hand and said how clever it is when folks do well.
Joshua Evans, his oldest son died about 21 years of age. On his death bed desired a pair of metal buckles that were carved brought to him and with a pair of pinchers broke them to pieces and threw them in the fire saying them things did not belong to Friends. Stacy Atkinson a young man near Moorestown on his death bed expressed a concern about the ruffles on the bosom of his shirt and now see William Penn’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 150.

{1788-12}
2nd of the 12th. Went to our preparative meeting which was a poor time.
[Right marginal note] Samme said he had not the least doubt but his afflictions were for his good.
3. About home.
4. I was at a stand about leaving Samme to visit the school but he took me by the hand and said, dear father, I don’t want to keep thee at home. Go, said he, maybe thee will be of some weight there and weightiness and solidity is wanting. I used to think so when I went to school. So I then went and I thought we had good solid time with the children. Rebekah Cowperthwaite was there and I thought I never seen her more favored, solid, savory and weighty and T. Redman.
5. Was Monthly Meeting. The Quarter’s committee, D. Cooper, M. Miller, and T. Redman on the case recommended from the General meeting respecting extending a labor to discourage distilling, retailing and using spirituous liquors. In the first sitting I gave way to reasoning and discouragement till the meeting parted I believe to my own and the meetings hurt loss and poverty. The business above mentioned was lively and smartly handled. A large committee was appointed to join the quarter’s committee. They met next day and I understand they had a lively favored strengthening conference.
6. About home. Our poor son lies very ill and seems in danger if he recovers of losing one eye.
7. Was First Day. We had a meeting with the Black people at our schoolhouse. Joshua Evans, B. Swet and his wife, E. Collins and R. Roberts was there. The poor Negroes were long a gathering which was a hurt and one thing more seemed against us which I, and I found others, thought for a time was like to have hurt the meeting and yet for all we were favored with a good profitable solid meeting on the whole and in the conclusion.
8. About home. Samme being sick we have many coming and going so that there seem little to be done to turn to any account. Money is very scarce, the like I think I never knew. There seems no way of coming at any to help ourselves with and other thing so trying that I don’t bear them with that patience I ought to do. O that I could once be healed of that old disorder impatience with the care and cumber of the world.
9. Went to our meeting. A very stormy day and to me a poor time.
10. About home getting firewood etc.
11. Killing hogs etc.
12. Cutting up pork and salting it up etc.
13. About home at sundry little matters.
14. Went to our meeting. Did my work to the halves and had but poor pay.
[Left marginal note] First Day
15. I went to settle some business with Joshua Borton and several others.
16. At our meeting. E. Atkinson was there. All shut up. A very poor time indeed.
17:18:19:20. About home. Our poor son lies yet very ill. The weather very cold. Very little of business to be done. A very trying time with me. The heavens seem as brass and the earth as iron. My props seem to be taken from under me.
[Left marginal note] *Robert Willis and Aaron Wills came to see us. Had a sitting to profit and satisfaction.
21. Was First Day. Was at our meeting. A poor time. I don’t know but I hurt myself and the meeting by giving way to reasoning too long though I have been spoke to on that account by several of late.
22. About home Solomon Gaskill and Samuel Atkinson came to see us.
23. At our meeting. S. Gaskill was there a very poor time.
24:25:26:27. About home. Very cold weather indeed. Could do very little but get firewood and fodder.
28. First Day. Went to our meeting. A very stormy day the meeting but small and things low and poor though I think better at last. I felt some better.
<pb id="A0011521_028"/>
29th Twelfth Month. About home. Samme lies very low and weak.
30. Went to our meeting. Something lively attended the meeting.
31. About home. Samme remarked how he was tried and afflicted and said maybe he was not enough humbled yet.
{1789-01}
1 of the First Month 1789. I went to Evesham Meeting which was pretty well. Elizabeth Collins was there and I thought it ended well. After meeting, friends had a conference concerning the business of company keeping to some advantaging so far as I know. The rest of this week about home. Joshua Evans was here to see us. I was on the shoals and beset with divers griping, grinding trials.
4. Was First Day. I was very unwell with a cold. Stayed at home.
5. About home.
6. Went to our preparative meeting which was strengthening to me and healing.
7 and 8. About home.
9. Was our Monthly Meeting. John Simpson, John Parrish, Daniel Offley and Solomon Gaskill was there. The first sitting was silent though solid and the last for business was pretty well. Simpson and Offley went in amongst the women and had lively service. Simpson labor was chiefly on that of company keeping amongst the youth very close in both men and women meetings. I had a share in the labor and some satisfaction though did not fully clear myself in divers matters. I thought I came away in debt to some and should never have the like opportunity Simpson spoke in that of drunkenness and state policy etc.
10. About home hauling wood etc.
11. We went to Cropwell Meeting. John Simpson was there and had a great deal to say. After meeting my wife and I dined at Theod Lippincott's. Had a sitting in which John Simpson had very extensive service.
The 12 about home.
13. At our meeting. Hannah Langdale, a young woman from town, spoke. I think it was a low time, though we owned her about home the rest of the week.
18. Was First Day. Went to our meeting and I think came off pretty well considering all things.
19. About home. Joshua Evans was here, but oh how shall I relate it? It was a time of sore grievous trial to me. When shall I be healed (wretched man that I am)? J.E. had a sitting with the family, but it was a low time with me.
[Left marginal note] at the burial of Joseph Morrel 
20. Went to our meeting. Joshua Evans was there and J.C. thinks he got along very well. Scraping work I think. The rest of the week I was about home, a time of trial and trouble. I was ready to apply that passage to myself, when tribulation or persecution arises etc. My weakness is prevail over me. Samme lies very helpless yet and low though mending.
<pb id="A0011521_029"/>
25th of the First Month 1789. Went to our meeting but no satisfaction though the silent part of the meeting not the worst. I must endeavour to wash my hands in innocence, that I may compass that that will produce peace and satisfaction – for how can I live so. Poor low times with us at meeting. A want of more patience in trials about home. Chiefly very cold winter weather.
{1789-02}
1st of the Second Month 1789. At our meeting: Silent and poor, I think we lose ground.
2. About home.
3. At our preparative meeting. Had a conference respecting the day of holding weekday meeting.
4. About home forepart. Joshua Evans came here. We went to [Mount] Holly. I mended a pump for Samuel Carr fitted up the boxes and put the old pump into a new well.
5. We were at their monthly meeting at [Mount] Holly. Things are very low there, dry and formal. It was a time of good sleighing and several couples passing meeting. Abundance of young people was there and I thought we came off very well. Had a pretty lively time with them. Joshua and I went in amongst the women and think it was a favored time with me. I came home. Very cold after night.
6. Was our monthly meeting very large and full crowded. John Tatham, Solomon Gaskill was there and I think we had a smart lively time. Friends seemed to get along and do business. Appointed a meeting of conference for parents and heads of families and appointed a committee to visit the Black people and a testimony was raised against divers wrong things, particularly that of driving about and going pleasuring a sleighing and sundry other things. I think a favored time.
7. Getting firewood etc.
8. Was First Day. Was at our meeting and I think it was a favored time with me.
9. Went to Samuel Shutes to make a pump 13 [feet]  long 7 [shillings] 6 Boxes he paid 8 [shillings] 4.
10. We came to our meeting, which was to my satisfaction. This evening Joseph and went to make a pump for Joseph Evans 15 [feet] 6 [inches] long Boxes 7 [shillings] 6. He paid 15 shillings.
11. We finished and we came home. [presumably added later] All paid off.
12. I went to Evesham to the marriage of William Vinicomb and Theo: Lippincott. I came off middling well, I believe having had a kind invitation. I went home with them. There was a pretty many people and especially of youth and they seemed light and airy. After dinner a sitting was proposed which for a time seemed not like to be complied with, but Joshua Lippincott and seated ourselves with several other Friends and at length they gathered a room crowded full and many very raw and light made the undertaking the more weighty to me but it was a highly favored time and we left them much quieted and stilled I thought.
13. I was cleaning some rye and took it to mill about 15 bushels. Then Joseph and I went to Joseph Champion’s to make a pump 17 feet 8 inches long, all settled.
14. We finished and came home. Very cold weather.
15. Was First Day. Went to our meeting. Things seemed but low. Indolence I fear too much prevails, though I came off pretty well as far as I know, though did not get along with that life as at some times. 
<pb id="A0011521_030"/>
16th Second Month, 1789. About home.
17. Went to our meeting. To me it was a low time. I believe some fared better.
The rest of this week I about home getting plow stuff. Very winter like weather. I did mend Joshua: Lippincott's pump and haul a load of rails from John Wilkin's. A great snow fell last of the week.
22. Was First Day. Went to our meeting which was to me a very favored strengthening time.
23. My wife and I went to the meeting of conference appointed for parents and heads of families which was a favored lively time. I do believe that light did arise and some of us did see clearer than ever where we were with respect to that of training up children and the custom of company keeping after the families are gone to bed. I do believe it was a strengthening time to many and the testimony raised into dominion. John Tatham and Job Whiteal was with us.
24. The rest of this week I was about home. Very cold weather. A great snow on the ground. Getting wood etc. A poor time with me, trials and weaknesses prevail.
{1789-03}
1 Day, Third [month]. Was First Day. I went to our meeting and to me low and silent.
2. About dressing out plow stuff etc.
3. Was our preparative meeting. A very poor time indeed. Had a conference on that of the Day of the week to fix our weekday meeting. A jumbling time.
4 and 5. About home.
6. Was monthly meeting which was but low and poor to what some have been of late but not much cause of complaint, except one thing, a little matter, made a sad jumble. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1789: "Friends from the Preparative Meeting at Upper Evesham reported that John Willitts hath been in the neglect of attending Meetings, that he frequents another congregation of people and on treatment thereupon impress a willingness to give up his right of Membership, adding that his Mind was reconciled to the change: which after attention given, united the Meeting in the appointment of William Rogers, Enoch Evans, Peter Andrews, and John Hunt to pay a solid visit to him and report their sense of his disposition of Mind to next Meeting."</note>  I went to Joshua Lippincott's to lodge.
7. Was Select Meeting. Job and E. Collins was there. I thought it was but a poor time at first but growed better after some.
8. First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting which was very small, the Measles being at almost every family in the neighborhood. It seemed so low and poor to me at first that I questioned whether I was right in coming, but it was on the whole very strengthening and satisfactory. A highly favored time to me.
9. We went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. I thought I came off middling well. I went in amongst the women, not to any disadvantage I hope. Things seemed low dry and formal amongst them and no wonder, everything considered.
10. Was our week day meeting. I wanted to stay away having been this five days running but it so fell out that we went and I was favored as soon as we sat off with a broken heart and my contrite spirit and in it ardent petitions for the preservation of my children. After meeting we went to see Phebe Burr who seemed near her end.
11. Dressing out plow stuff.
12. Trimming orchard and making fence.
13. Heard of the death of Phebe Burr and Ann Tomlinson.
14. Went to the burial of Phebe Burr. Had a meeting not satisfactory to me. Consider why and improve thereby.
15. First Day. A poor low time to me.

<pb id="A0011521_031"/>

18. About plows etc.
19. I went to Select Meeting at Haddonfield. I thought it but a poor time.
20. Was our Quarterly Meeting. Job Scott from New England was there and had excellent service in both meetings. A good profitable meeting.
21. I with J. Collins, Joshua Lippincott and E. Evans went to Select Meeting at Philadelphia which was a good solid meeting. I stayed in town till Second Day night meeting ended about 8 at night and then came up with J. Lippincott, E. Evans and got home about 12 at night.
24. Went to our meeting which was to my satisfaction.
The rest of this week I was at work at plows and making fence etc. Mended Samuel Allinson’s pump.
29. Was First Day. I went to a meeting at Long-a-Coming appointed by Solomon Gaskill which was a hard laborious time at first but ended pretty solid and well and one of our elders thought it might be a comfortable time to some though I thought it might been much better. 
[Right marginal note] Had a sitting in A. Inskeep’s family to some satisfaction.
30. About plow making.
31. Went to our meeting. A poor time with me.
{1789-04}
1 Fourth Month. About some plows.
2. My wife and I went to Evesham Meeting which I thought but poor but I found after it was a profitable strengthening time to us. Committee on Negro Cases met to advantage I hope and believe.
3 and 4. About a pump for John Allinson, 46 feet long.
5. First Day. Went to our meeting. Solomon Gaskill was there and had a great deal to say. The meeting middling well.

[Right marginal note] Had a sitting J. Mich Linch’s family with S. Gaskill and went to see J. French

8. We went to the burial of Samuel Haines, a young man suddenly snatched away in the bloom of life. We had a meeting and a pretty solid good time I believe it was to some.

19. At our meeting on First Day. A pretty lively time to me. A solid meeting.	
[Right marginal note] First Day
21. About a plow for Joseph Coles, paid for.
22. Rebecca Wright was at our meeting. Notice thereof being given on First Day, a many got there. A most distressing trying dull heavy time I thought it was and I found Rebecca Wright thought so too, for after a long time she got up and told us that it seemed to her we had been sitting together in a way that seemed very discouraging. However she went on and had a pretty lively time and so the meeting ended better on the whole, but it was a poor time to me.
23:24 and 25. Hauling out dung and 26 Made a plow for John Stokes, paid.
27. Was First Day. I went to a meeting at Micajah Willits’ up in the Barrens which was but small and middling. After meeting we had a pretty clever opportunity in the family. A tendering time it was to some and Enoch Evans and I had another pretty close time on the way home in Jonathan Crispin’s family. I lodged at Enoch Evans.
28. Got to plow.
29. Went to our meeting, a poor time.
30. Plowing.
31. We went to Haddonfield meeting to the marriage of John Thorn and Mary Dubre, she being brought up with us was somewhat like an adopted daughter. The meeting was somewhat favored and solid. The people after dinner was sober and orderly as is common to say but a right spirit not prevalent, according to my mind. The worldly conversation too much prevailed, so the way did not open for a solid sitting and we did not experience our water turned into wine as they of Cana of Galilea.
{1789-05}
1 of the Fifth Month. Plowing. Our cousin John Biseel was here.
2. Plowing and we went in the evening with our cousin Bissell to Joseph Warrington’s.
3. Was First Day. We went to a meeting with Solomon Gaskill and other Friends at Moses Hamil’s near the river shore and a highly favored time we had amongst the Methodists who behaved respectful and well and we parted with them with sweetness and great satisfaction. Having had an open time this afternoon we visited several Negro families which were favored times and to good satisfaction. An highly favored day.
<pb id="A0011521_033"/>

5. Was our preparative meeting. S. Gaskill was there. The meeting for worship was middling but that for business was a grievous poor time.
6. About home.
7. I went to help put up the shed at the meeting house.
8. Was monthly meeting. The first sitting and forepart of the meeting for business was pretty well, but it grew lower and poorer, but towards the last it revived a little. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, May 1789: "Our Friend John Hunt expecting shortly to leave his Habitation in order to comply with the appointment of our last Thearly meeting of Warrington and Fairfax opened to this Meeting a drought of love that had for some time attended his Mind to visit with Friends at Crooked Run and Southland Meetings, and such other Meetings thereaway as he may feel his Mind engaged in Gospel love to visit; which after being weightily considered the Meeting leaves him at Liberty to proceed therein as Truth may dictate, he being a Minister in good esteem amongst us. The Clk. is directed to furnish him with a copy of this Minute, and sign it on behalf of this Meeting."</note>  
9. Was select meeting and a distressing poor time it was for the most part, though we had some pretty close scraping and scratching about answering queries.
10. Went to our meeting. Came off bravely. A strengthening time.
11. About home.
12. Went to our meeting which was but low though instructing to me. The rest of this week about planting.
17. Was First Day. Went to our meeting. Came off middling pretty well only I hurt myself hurrying too much.
18. About planting.
19. At our meeting. A sorrowful, dull poor time as I ever saw.
Sixth Month 19 and 20. About home.
21 Fifty [Day] of the week. I set off toward Fairfax Quarterly Meeting, pursuant to an appointment of our last Yearly Meeting, respecting a division and arrangement of meetings to be laid off to Baltimore Yearly Meeting, to which service James Pemberton, Abraham Gibbons, Jacob Lindley, William Savery, Benjamin Reeve, John Hunt, Benjamin Mason, Samuel Smith, William Hartshorn, Joseph West and William Richardson are appointed to attend the Quarterly Meetings of Fairfax and Pipe Creek.
22. Proceeded on. Dined at Joshua Baldins. Had a little opportunity at parting. Went as far as Isaac Cots’s.
23. After a little opportunity in the family, William Savery, William Hartshorn, Elish Kirk and myself went on to Yorktown and lodged at E. Kirk’s.
[Left marginal note] Crossed the Susquehanna River
24. Was a First Day. We went to their meeting which to me was a poor time. Perhaps my giving way to diffidence was a hurt to the whole meeting. William Savery preach but all did not seem to do. In the afternoon, having had a little hammering, I took courage and we had a good open favored time. I had good satisfaction. Here are several choice Friends: Elisha Kirk, Peter Yarnall and William Matthews, a father in Israel.
25. William Savery, William Hartshorn and I rode on through a very wet day through divers flourishing towns. At Hanover or Mecolister we seen what they called an American lion. It was about the size of a calf of four weeks old. Its shapes much like a cat and color like a deer. Its tail three feet long. Said to be 18 months [old].
[Left marginal note] I had a very satisfactory time with some young women at P. Yarnals just after meeting, sisters of Ruth Kirk.
<pb id="A0011521_034"/>
We got to Allen Farquhar’s at Pipe Creek to lodge.
26. We traveled from Allen Farquhar's to Joseph Janney’s at Fairfax.
27. Quarterly Meeting began which on the whole was a much favored time. I thought I came off bravely. J.L. Took M B the H.
29. Was youth’s meeting. William Savery, Jacob Lindley and Abraham Gibbons were much favored in the exercise of their gifts. A door of utterance was opened and it was, I doubt not, a favored time with many and I believe generally speaking solid good meeting, but to me it was a time trial and close striping and poverty. 
This afternoon my brother Robert Hunt and I came over Potomac River towards Pipe Creek. Lodged at Richard Richardson’s, near old Manoquancy meeting house where my cousin William Hunt was born. Here I wanted to have a meeting, but through diffidence and fear came away not easy. I sadly missed it. So no trade wind today, except at one Whitcraft’s where we dined a little opportunity. So on to old Allen Farquhar's to lodge.
30. I went select meeting at Pipe Creek. Here were harpers: s<italic>ee </italic>Revelations 5:8 and 14:2 and divers played to good purpose.
31. I went to a meeting, with William Savery, A. Gibbons and Isaac Everett, appointed at Fredericktown a few miles this side [of] Munockacy. The meeting was held in a Baptist meeting house not finished. I thought it was but a poor time though a pretty deal said. This afternoon we had a meeting at Woodsburough to very good satisfaction. A solid favored time. I got some acquaintance with Isaac Everett a great minister and father in our Israel. His company and conversation was very edifying and comforting. We rode 42 miles and had two meetings. I lodged at Moses Forquhair’s.
{1789-06}
1st of the Sixth Month. Was Quarterly Meeting at Pipe Creek which was but middling. It seemed hard laboring though ended pretty well. I lodged at Moses Farquehar’s.
2. This morning I had a good time in Joseph Wright’s family and a number of strangers there. This day was youth’s meeting at Pipe Creek which was a hard poor time, though we had a pretty deal of preaching, the laborers complain. I with B. Mason, A. G. and several women Friends came on our way about six miles towards Baltimore. I lodged at Nathan Hain’s.
3 of the Sixth Month. This morning at parting I had a good favored time in the family, then came 12 miles to an appointed meeting at little Winchester at which I fared but poorly for want of something, but William Mathews being old and hardy labored through all. We dined at one G. Guess’s, a Negro master and had a close time with him respecting his Negroes. Maybe he may remember it another day, though he seemed then very hardened. We had also on his a close conference concerning a hireling minister then rode twelve miles to Roysters town lodged at a tavern.
4th. We had a meeting in this town in a Methodist or Presbyterian meeting house where the people are much unacquainted with Friends. To me it was a trying undertaking, but we were favored to come off pretty well and with satisfaction. After meeting we rode eighteen miles to Baltimore. I took up my lodging at John Brown’s and found most excellent entertainment.
5. We had little to do, except the town to view, and visit our Friends which we did to great satisfaction. 
6. Was Select Meeting, which for a time was to me hard and laborious, but life arose and it was a pretty lively time. On the whole, I thought edifying. This afternoon I attend their Meeting for Sufferings. Friends seemed under a good degree of care for the poor Black whose situation at this time is deplorable in some parts of Maryland and Virginia. Friends were stirred up to diligence and faithfulness.
7. Was First Day. Jacob Lindley was largely opened in his gift but I thought it a hard labor our time at meeting this afternoon, which was to me a poor time though William Matthews and several were largely opened. I hope it will be gathered another day.
<pb id="A0011521_035"/>
9 of the Sixth Month 1789. I went to a meeting held in the courthouse which was an open time as to the ministry. William Savery and Peter Yarnall were largely opened but poor times with me this afternoon. The Yearly Meeting for business began. I got a little better along. 
Select Meeting met again. I thought I seen something to do, but waiting for a confirmation another and another etc. etc. took up the time and some met again minutes being read and committees appointed to inspect accounts etc. Adjourned till 10 next day and accordingly met. All went on very well. Next select meeting met. I thought a pretty lively time. The consideration of the state of society was entered upon and many lively sentences communicated. 
Next Yearly Meeting met at 10 at which setting our business respecting the arrangement of the meetings was concluded with great unanimity. Met again at 4th hour. Minutes of the Meeting for Sufferings was read. The subject respecting the poor Blacks was taken up and a very lively conference held and an address to the Assembly agreed to be draw up and signed at large. Much unanimity and zeal appeared in this matter. 
11 of the week the state of society was taken up and a highly favored lively time it was. The testimony was raised into dominion in divers respects in the afternoon likewise are had a very good favored time on the subject of spirituous liquors in which much unity and zeal appeared.
11. I had a sitting this morning in the tent house. 80 they say or there abouts in family. <note resp="transcr">Journal expands "I had a religious opportunity with the large family in the tent-house, about eighty in number, who were mostly such Friends as had come to attend the Yearly Meeting, and board themselves," 256.</note>  Came off very well satisfied. Mary Berry, one of their family from the Eastern Shore, had good service. A lively minister. How wonderful it is that the Lord raises up some in almost every place. 
Met at 10th hour on business. A distressing poor time. Yesterday we could run through a troop and leap over the walls of opposition and today stumble at a trifling matter <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 22:30, Psalms 18:29</note> . Did nothing this sitting to purpose. Met again at 4. Got along pretty well.
12. Had three sittings this day with the Select Meeting, then the meeting concluded. On the whole I think it was a favored time in which the testimony of truth gained ground in divers respects. Its cause of humble thankfulness that I went out with full unity of my Friends and I hope parted with my friends and fellow laborers so at Baltimore, though it was a very tendering humbling thing to leave home on such business.
13th of the Sixth Month 1789. I with William Hartshorn and Joseph Ast. set off from Baltimore and rode 69 miles toward Wilmington. Lodged at Caleb Byrns, a kind Friend and had a little opportunity in the family at parting.
14. Was First Day I was at Chester meeting in Delaware where things are at a low ebb with Friends. I came off middling considering all. I got home to my family and found all well about 10 or 11 at night.
[Left marginal note] Miles: 44 from Caleb Byrns. 113 miles in two days.
15. I was unwell.
16. I was at our meeting at which a marriage was accomplished. I thought it was a pretty solid lively time.
17. I went to the burial of Michael Linch. I had a favored time at the gave, to good satisfaction and peace of mind. This afternoon John Collins, John Roberts and I went to see a retailer of rum newly sat up near us. There appeared room to hope the visit would be of use to them, and tend to the peace and clearing of our own mind what I said. The rest of this week home about tending our corn and about a cheese press for William Coat.
21. At our meeting First Day. I came off middling well, passable.
22. About home.
23. At our meeting a most distressing dull drowsy time indeed. The rest of this week about home.

29. About a pump for G. Githirs, 15 long.
[Left marginal note] J.C. said my spirit was with them.
30. Went to our meeting which proved in the end very satisfactory to me.
{1789-07}
1 of the Seventh Month. With John Hinchman who this morning departed.
<pb id="A0011521_036"/>
2 of the Seventh Month 1789. We went to the burial of John Hinchman, buried at Haddonfield. Benjamin Swet had a pretty deal to say but to me it was a poor shut up time. We were out of season getting to meeting, which was a hurt to the opportunity, I thought.
3. This day as we were at work at hay in the meadow there arose a whitish cloud out of the south and as it gathered and rose up it began to thunder. When it came nearly right over us, it thundered very hard. There seemed to be two claps that struck, however one struck a walnut tree at G. Githin’s and struck the shop that stood very near the tree, set the shop on fire. They soon put it out and it did but little damage. It stunned and very much surprised several in and near the house. There was no rain in the cloud and I think it must have went three-quarters of a mile from the cloud to the shop. 
A few weeks ago when I was in Virginia I seen a letter from William Dikson at Redstone giving an account of his son about 19 being killed with the thunder the 15th of the Fifth Month last as he sat at dinner with others of the family. His mother and sister were gone to meeting. He was not perceived to breath after he was struck down. A dog under the table yelped out and went out of the house and laid down and died immediately.
Elizabeth Atkinson informed me that up at the Black Horse or near there three boys went to a well to drink. Drawed some water and one handed the cup to the other, and then thunder struck the well pole and killed one of the boys in the spot.
At Baltimore a vessel was struck and I am informed. The news gives account of several cattle being killed all this spring or summer.
4. About hay. This night was a time of terrible heavy thunder after a very hot dry spell of weather.
5. Was First Day. At our meeting. I think I had a favored good opportunity. This afternoon Enoch Evans, Samuel Allinson, John Collins and I went to visit R.S. on account of retailing spirituous liquors and had a pretty lively time as to clearing ourselves. But Oh how doth a bribe blind the eyes, how dark a body is the earth and how are many eclipsed! Then we went to see Joseph Lee, not a professor with us, on account of his keeping a Negro a slave. I have a hope a use will arise from the visit though they seemed then deaf to entreaty and impatient with council. But the Negro got free soon after<italic>.</italic>
6. About hay.
7. Was our preparative meeting and a most miserable poor time it was. I could wished myself away before it was over. Search for the cause and labor to have it removed that the effect may cease.
8 and 9. About hay.
9. Went to our monthly meeting. Joshua Evans and Solomon Gaskill was there. The meeting I thought not so much favored as some, but I thought I came off bravely. A strengthening time of favor. <note resp="transcr"> Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, July 1789: "John Hunt returned to this Meeting, the Copy of a Minute granted him in the 5th Month last, with an account of the satisfaction he witnessed in the course of his journey."</note> 
10. About reaping and hay etc. A sad affair happened. The gates of confusion opened and I went in too far.
<pb id="A0011521_037"/>
12th of the Seventh Month 1789. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell and after a time of poverty, the meeting being small, I think I had a favored time. However my friends owned me as fare as I could discover. Went to I. Lippincott to dine afternoon. We had a Negro meeting which was but a poor low time and few laborers; however after a hard tug I thought it ended a little better.
13. About our hay and harvest.
14. Went to our meeting which was a distressed poor dull time I believe. The rest of this week we were getting in our hay and harvest and were favored to get along through with it very cleverly and had a good crop of grass and grain which is cause of thankfulness and a great favor. See Genesis chapter 11 15 verse, ay from verse 13 to the end.
19. Was First Day. I went with Joseph Warrington over to Byberry meeting. Came off middling I believe.
20. About home.
21. At our meeting. Heavy work. Something is the matter. I labored hard but no satisfaction. The rest of this week about home at corn.
26. Was First Day. Joseph Clerk and William Ashby from Philadelphia was here and went etc. with us to meeting. Jesse Kersey was there also and we had a favored solid lively meeting I thought and I find J.C. says so too, but I missed and hurt myself for want of more deliberation though came off pretty well.
27. About tending corn etc.
28. At our meeting. My wife says it was the best weekday meeting she had seen there this some years, but I can’t say so, though I don’t know that I had much cause to complain. She thinks I was favored.
29. About corn and went to look timber for S[amuel] R[udrow] pump.
30 and 31. About a pump for Samuel Rudrow, 23 [feet] 6 [inches] long.
{1789-08}
2 of the Eighth Month. Was First Day. I had a rousing time but refining from the Lees. See Jeremiah 48:11 and Zephaniah 1:12.
3. Went after timber for John Thorn’s pump. A very wet day.
4. Went to our preparative meeting. Silent and low, poor.
5 and 6. At work at Thorn’s pump at home here.
7. Went to our monthly meeting. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, August 1789:  Committee to Visit Black Families, Committee on Schools reports.</note>  A young man from Philadelphia, John Hutton made a notable prayer. The first sitting pretty well but as to the business dullness and heaviness prevailed with many. I fear we grow more dry and formal people work and weary themselves in the heat at harvest and hay till they are in no capacity for a religious services but are like creatures just come out of the water half drowned stupid dull and heavy drowsy.
8. At work at plows for John Barton and S. Roberts’s and in the afternoon we put in J. Thorn’s pump 35 feet long.
<pb id="A0011521_038"/>
9th of the Eighth Month, 1789. My wife and son Joseph and I went to Ancocas meeting. Robert Willis was there. Things seemed very low. Robert labored and tugged hard and seemed to raise the life a little at last. I came off middling, I believe, for low hard times. We went to brother Aaron’s to dine. Spent the afternoon in pleasant conversation in the company of our Friends, Robert Willis being there, but on review I thought I seen where we might have spent it much better and to more satisfaction if we had called the young people and family together and as William Penn says let every visit be a meeting and every family a church and every head of a family a minister etc. We went to Joseph Buzby’s to lodge.
10. We got home about noon and I finished S. Roberts plow.
11. Went to our meeting, a low poor time till last. I got up and got along beyond expectation and to some satisfaction.
12. Samme and I went to make a top piece for Enoch Evan’s pump twelve feet and a half long.
13. I went to Evesham meeting, a hard dull time. I labored, but to little purpose I fear, though I know no what others thought. Sort of rough work but no pay. Finished the pump, paid.
13 and 14. About some hay, sowing turnips etc. Joseph Clark was here. Most uncommon hot weather I think as I ever seen.
14:15. About some hay.
16. Was First Day at our meeting. John Huttoon was there and I thought we had a pretty good solid meeting. J. H. came home with me. This evening was a hard thunder shower. Lawrence Welester’s barn was burnt with lightning and one horse killed in the stable.
17. I went up to Samuel Carr’s to make a pump. It was very wet weather. The pump was 26 feet 6 inches long. Finished the pump.
[Left marginal note] All settled and paid off
20th. I was at Holly weekday meeting and a very dull poor dwarfish place it seemed to be. I thought I was given up to suffer with the seed, but At last I had something to do I hope to no disadvantage at least.
21 [or 20]. I came down to Evesham meeting. Solomon Gaskill was with me and we had a smart time of labor I thought.
21. I made a plow for Nathan Haines.
22. Cutting briars.
23. Was First Day. Enoch Evans went with me to Vincent Town meeting, which was very small dull poor and dwarfish I had very hard labor and but little satisfaction though I hope did not hurt. They are just on the point to conclude to let their meeting fall and give out. We came to Lawrence Webster’s to dine. Had a sitting with the family with which Enoch Evans expressed good satisfaction and said he did not begrudge going and Lawrence said he was glad of our company. E. Evans said the hints were very pertinent and they may be [illegible] but to me it was a day of hard sort of labor. I wanted more of the life and love of truth.
24. Cutting briars etc.
25. At our meeting. A hard laborious time to me, though I find my wife thinks I did very well. A degree of life attended.
25. I went after a pine log for a pump.
26. Went make a top piece for Samuel Stokes: his pump 13 long.
27. Finished.
28. Dressing out plow stuff.
<pb id="A0011521_039"/>
30th of the Eighth Month, 1789. Was First Day. I went to our meeting. We came off middling well I believe. Jnde Fatham was there. I went to Joseph Warrington’s.
31. Joseph and Beke and I went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting. The first sitting, there was but little said, but I thought there was something of a solemnity over the meeting and there was a time in answering queries in which there was life attended and divers lively sentences were dropped tending to raise the testimony in several thing considerably. To my satisfaction it appeared that a lively concern was spreading with respect to the advice of the Yearly Meeting tending to discourage the use of spirituous liquors. I had good satisfaction amongst them. We went to brother Aaron’s to lodge.
{1789-09}
1st of the Ninth Month. We came to the youth’s meeting which for a time was a very hard laborious time, but at last truth arose into dominion seemingly through the labors of Samuel Emlen and Thomas Scattergood, the last being raised in great eminence in the exercise of this gift and a highly favored time it was in the end. In his testimony, he spoke much to and closely warned and cautioned the youth and mentioned a very alarming instance of four young people being buried in one grave to which he said he was lately an eye witness and said they had just before been solemnly warned at such a meeting as this.
The case, as I was afterwards informed, was this: A company of young people after the Quarterly Meeting at Rahway went out in a party of pleasuring and for recreation went to the sea shore as it was said. Seven of them went at low water along the shore to gather little sea shells. They at entering on the sand bar at low water had crossed a low place and, whilst they were diverting themselves along the shore, the tide arose so high that it prevented their getting across the low place, the tide or the sea coming in very rapidly and no boat of relief could be had. At this surprising prospect, it is said, they screamed and cried out most grievously, the young women clinging fast to one young man that was with them and so seven of them were drowned and four of them taken up. A part of the clothes said to be found of the others and supposed the bodies of them were eaten by sharks.
[Left marginal note] It is said one young man swam ashore and was saved.
This seemed to revive in memory several instances of some at different times being drowned going to the beach at Egg Harbor. 
Last Seventh Day Silas Applegate of Ancocas went to market and was taken very suddenly with a pain in his head and Ears and died on First Day night. They say his ears turned black and purged. They took him up as far as Richard Fenimore’s and there he died before they could get him home.
2:3:4. About home making a pump for Samuel Corr and other things about the place.
5. I went to take Isaac Carr’s pump home, 21 feet long.
6. Was First Day at our meeting which I do think was a favored solid meeting. I had good satisfaction, a favor time since I came from Burlington. My wife and I went to see Joshua Bispham and wife who are far advanced in years and I hope in a good degree of [innocency?]. This evening Samuel Mattacks child was buried with the flux. I like to forgot being at the burial of Abraham Warrington 's child last Fourth Day with the flux. I thought I had a favored lively time at the house.
<pb id="A0011521_040"/>
This 6 of the Ninth Month 1789, we heard of the death of Richard Fenimore. This day week S. Applegate died at his house but it seems it had but little effect on him. This R. Fenimore was a man favored with a good estate and was twice married. Had valuable women to his wives and lived reputably a number of years, but giving way to drink to excess and in the time of the last war he went out lay out got cold and it fell in his eyes and he lost his eyesight and has been blind many years. His last wife died a few years ago. He continuing in drunkenness and very self willed. At last, as was said, refused to go to bed. The people of the house quenched the fire out or nearly out however in the morning they found him on the fire across the hand irons, burnt to death. His side etc. next the fire burnt to a crisp.
7. About home.
8. Was our preparative meeting. John Cox was there and spoke well and seems very hopeful. There seemed something in the first sitting. But as to the business – answer queries – it was a painful time of poverty. David Cooper was there.
9 and 10. About a bedstead at home.
11. At monthly meeting. John Cox Jr. was there and David Cooper. I thought the meeting on the whole was middling. Some things very lively.
12. Was Select Meeting. John Cox was there. I thought it was a hard laborious scraping time to me and no satisfaction.
13. Was First Day. My wife and I went to Cropwell Meeting. I sent some notice I intended to be there and should be willing to see the people generally together and oh how did Satan exert himself and his instruments to lay waste the opportunity. The forepart of the meeting was hard and dull and I had a close conflict but after a while got a little settled and a favored lively time to good satisfaction. I thought the meeting ended very well. We went to Joshua Lippincott’s to dine and in the afternoon went to the Negroes’ meeting. Robert Willis and Hannah Cathril was there and a lively favored time it was. Several Friends had good service. Hannah Cathril especially was savory and lively.
We heard of the death of Joseph Wilsheir’s wife who died very suddenly. Went to bed well as usual and awaked in the night, hastily desired her husband to rub her hand and said it felt numb. He according did and asked her if he rubbed it right and when she answered he found her speech failed and then he got up and got a light and found she was dying. He sent for some neighbors but she was dead before any came.
14. About home.
15. At our meeting. Robert Willis was there and had good service. I thought when he sat down there was a solemn covering over the meeting, but there was a stubborn self-willed fellow, Samuel Lawrence, that Friends at Mount Holly (for preaching) had disowned. He disturbs us and hurt the conclusion with it though two Friends desired him to sit down.
The rest of this week about sowing rye.
<pb id="A0011521_041"/>
Was First Day. Went to our meeting. Joshua Evans was there and I.C. thinks he never heard him a more lively and I came off bravely as far as I know. Went after a load of pine in Barrens. S. Stokes with me went to our meeting and at it again to the s[atisfaction] of some, I believe what ever others thought of it. Went to the burial of Sam Stokes’ child, four years old. Maybe it was a poor shut up time, though the people were orderly.
24. I went to Select Meeting at Haddonfield. Rebekah Jones from Philadelphia was there and had weighty service and thought there was a sweetness in the silent part of the meeting. A pretty good solid meeting.
25. Was Quarterly Meeting at Haddonfield. It was very full crowded and more I believe than the house would hold. Rebekah Jones from Philadelphia was highly favored in the exercise of her gift in the ministry, raised indeed in great eminence and it had a reach upon many, though our young women were too light in their appearance, fluttering their fans whilst our dearly beloved friends D. Offley and R. Jones were laboring in so solemn and weighty a manner, concerning which I found it my business to go into the women’s meeting to clear myself of the young women and came off with satisfaction. The meeting for business was pretty well conducted though there was not that openness for labor and the testimony raised as I could wish respecting some matters and as at some times. Our brother Aaron Wills was here and he with me went to Joseph Mickel’s to lodge. E. Evans and some other Friends from Egg Harbor was there.
26. This morning we had a sitting in the family to general satisfaction as far as I could discover and I believe it was so. Then we went over to Philadelphia to the meeting of ministers and elders: which to me in the forepart but dull and trying. I had been unwell and could not sleep the night or too before, but John Lloyd had good service in the first sitting and William Savery, John Simpson, and James Simpson had lively service in the last on the subject of love and unity. A harmonious labor together for the honor of the truth. John said we could not buy peace too dear and concerning keeping our covenants and amongst our friends neighbor and in our families how great a thing it was to maintain the unity and the way to do it was to keep faithfully our covenants, for if we lost that badge of discipleship we lost all.
I came home this evening. Brother Aaron was a few years ago been a captain in the wars, a carpenter by trade and a very drunken profligate man. A few weeks ago came home on Seventh Day night from his work very drunk and as usual very abusive to his wife and family next night was taken very ill. After lying a few days he begun to be much alarmed with death and appeared much surprised and very penitent. He sent for a Methodist, a Negro man whom he had derided, to pray for him, which he did. Near the last of the week he sent for one to make his will, but when the man came he said it was too late he could not do any thing at it. He appeared all along to the very last very sensible after desiring his brother to take care of his business and his wife and children and his effects etc. He seemed always in prayer and desired them about him to pray for him especially the last day or two. A few hours before he went of he asked what o’clock it was. When he was told he said (naming the hour) at such an hour I shall go off and be with Christ and died exactly as he had said.

27th of the Ninth Month 1789. First Day. My wife and I went to Cropwell Meeting and although not so clear of some spots as I could wish, yet after a time of some suffering and hard labor it was a tip top highly favored time with me. We went to see sister E.H. at Elisha Hooton’s.
{1789-10}
4 of the Tenth Month, 1789. Was First Day. We went to our meeting. Jonas Cattle, Benjamin Linton and I thought there was a covering of solemn silence in a good degree over the meeting towards the last, but for my part I got no satisfaction, perhaps for want of better guarding against right and left hand errors as we were cautioned last week.
5. About laying out flax etc.
[Right marginal note] 5 we went to the burial of William Shute, where I did not quite please myself in timing the matter.
6. Was our preparative meeting. A poor time guard strictly against one weakness perhaps I missed it on the opposite side.
7:8. About husking corn etc.
9. Was our monthly meeting. Samuel Lawrence came there as if it was on purpose to disturb the meeting, which he did and the first sitting was broke up over his head and so ended in confusion or too much so to what it should be. And then several couples being to pass meeting, our young people seem elevated and a spirit of lightness prevailed to which the weightier part was not a sufficient balance, for so upon the whole it was but a poor time to what it might, or what it should have been. One shot to my satisfaction. More humility, circumspection and reverent care I see is wanting.
John Morton, one of our neighbors, was buried whilst I was at the Yearly Meeting. I had been several times to see him whilst he was sick, which was but a few weeks. When he was first taken amiss, his wife one First Day after meeting came to me and asked me to come and see her husband and said he seemed very poorly, but could hardly tell what ailed him, only said he seemed low in his mind. Next day I went to see him and found him very humble and weighty in his spirit. After some conversation he said, O John I am not sick like a dying man, but I believe the Lord has a mind to stop me. He seemed tender and weighty. I advised him to labor for a state of resignation and to endeavor to keep his mind stayed on the Lord. Ah, said he, it’s an easy thing to talk of, but it’s a hard thing for such a one as I to come to it. I am now going on towards sixty year old. I have been this forty years now in the wide world in all manner of wickedness, drunkenness and whoring etc. I went again and he told me he never expected to go out of his room till he was carried out. I told him that must be a solemn awful prospect. He said he did not desire to continue here any longer, that he was now only waiting to be prepared. He said it seemed as if all that ever he did came before him, things that he never expected to think of any more come into his mind. I told [him] I thought it was a good sign and that it was the good remembrances that was near who told the woman of Samaria all that ever she did. I have a hope of his being one of the happy number whose sins go beforehand to judgment, as we read some men’s go beforehand to judgment.
And some follow after I told him we had been favored with a good meeting, he said he was glad to hear it and wished it might continue. 
Now whilst I write this I hear of the death of Hannah Allen, daughter of Anthony. A lusty fat healthy young woman in the bloom of life between eighteen and twenty years old. Died with the measles.

10. About our corn.
11. Was First Day at our meeting and what shall I say about it? Upon the whole I think it was a time of favor and ended very well solid and a solemnity at last covered the meeting, and yet our elders not well pleased nor myself altogether. Need of getting still a little deeper and a little deeper, R. Jones said and more and more out of the mixture.
13. Went to the burial of Aguila Lippincott and a distressed shut up dull dry time it was at meeting. I thought not reputable.
11[?] about our corn.
<pb id="A0011521_043"/>
11. Tenth Month, 1789. Most of this week about corn.
16th. On Sixth Day evening Robert Willis came to see us and staid all night and his company was very comfortable and edifying.
17. I went with Robert Willis to Joshua Lippincott’s and there we had a sitting in the family. Came off pretty well, I hope.
18. Was First Day. Came off middling so so. A time of close tight contest about some matters between me and some of my Friends. I hope we shall get over it.
19. Gathering in winter apples etc.
20. Went to our meeting, which was better than common for our weekday meetings, though many were very drowsy. The rest of this week gathering apples and sundry things about home. Samuel and Job and Lydia are gone to Egg Harbor.

{1789-11}
1st of the Eleventh Month, 1789. Was First Day. My wife very poorly. I and the children went to our meeting, but no satisfaction. Things grow worse and worse till a door seemed to open wide to destruction which was humbling.
2. I went to mend a pump for brother S. Stokes and one for Caleb Lippincott.
3. Was our preparative meeting which was a very poor time to me. Ready to conclude it is time to shut up and lay by.

5. I went to Evesham Preparative Meeting which was a favored strengthening healing time to me to good satisfaction.
6. Was our monthly meeting. Thomas Scattergood was there and Robert Willis. A good solid meeting. Divers young couples passed meeting and that business transacted with a good degree of solidity more so than at some other times.
7. Was our Select Meeting. Robert Willis was there. The forepart was low and dull but it ended lively and well or pretty well, though great room for improvement.
8 Was First Day: I went to Cropwell Meeting and am in hopes. Came off pretty well this afternoon. Samuel Lippincott and John Reeve had a meeting at Cropwell. A large door of utterance was opened which I hope will be as bread cast on the waters and found after many days. I heard of the death of E. Braddock, a young woman about 19, died with the disorder now so prevalent.
9. I went to get a log for J. Stiles pump.
[Right marginal note] This young woman’s sister died in 1798 and John Evans' son.
10. Was our weekday meeting. J. Reeve and S. Lippincott was there and had an open time in gospel labor and the meeting was solid. John commended their orderly gathering and sitting as I was told afterwards.
11. I went to Thomas Hollinshead to make a top piece for his pump, 11 feet long.

[Left marginal note sideways] Joseph Sharpe died 2nd 1784
<pb id="A0011521_044"/>
15. Eleventh Month, 1789. Was First Day. We were at Piles Grove meeting at which was buried David Davis Jr. his wife. Daniel Offley was there and had extensive service.
16. Was Quarterly Meeting. At the close of the first sitting Thomas Scattergood did speak most beautiful and most sweetly, like apples of gold in pictures of silver [Proverbs 25: 11]. This afternoon in meeting of business was a favored time with me, more so than ever before. At that place I found J. Li., Thomas Scattergood, J.C. and others were much pleased.
17. Was youth’s meeting which I thought was but poor and low though not for want of words.
18. We came home and found all well. I had divers good satisfactory sittings whilst I was out, one at Christopher Smith’s and one at D. Basit’s and at J. Mason’s.
19. Went to make a top piece for Thoms Stiless pump, 11 feet long.
20-21. We finished Stiles his pump, I went to mend I. Dudley’s pump and to see some Friends from Virginia.
22. Was First Day. I thought I came off but poorly at meeting, but we, that is my wife and I had a favored tendering time with some from Virginia, my old schoolmates.
23. About home.
24. Went to our meeting but no satisfaction. Some thing is the matter somewhere, somehow.
24. Went to Samuel Allinson’s about a pump.
26. Was a very stormy day. I went to the burial of James Hollen, a poor man on the town, crazy and died at the hospital, but they brought him up here to bury, but it was so stormy and so few come they did not bury him.
27. I went to the burial of James Hollen at Mount Holly here. Joshua Evans met with me and I went with him to David Ridgaway’s to lodge. We had a sitting with the family to advantage I hope.
28. We went to Chesterfield Select Meeting, which I thought was but a dry time, though Joshua had some lively service. We went to Isaac Collins at Trenton to lodge.
29. Was First Day this morning. I had a satisfactory sitting with a Negro family, then went to their meeting at Trenton, where are but a few Friends, though the meeting to me in the forepart a very baptizing season, but Joshua was favored in the exercise of his gift and I had a share at last in the labor to good satisfaction and the meeting ended very well and solid. After meeting we had a sitting with a family that was just about to set off to the back new country, which was pretty well as far as I could see. Some seemed tender and after that we had a sitting with Isaac Collin’s family, which was I thought pretty lively then we came to John Wright’s and had another sitting to satisfaction.
30. Was Quarterly Meeting at Chesterfield. <note resp="transcr">Journal: In the latter end of the 11th month, I accompanied Joshua Evans to the Quarterly Meeting held at Crosswicks- We were also at Trenton meeting," 257.</note>  Daniel Offley and William Savery and divers others, John Simpson, the meeting I thought but low to what it might have been, though in both meeting for business and the other at times there was something lively.
{1789-12}
1 of the Twelfth Month, 1789. Very youth’s meeting. William Savery and D. Offley had chief of the service of the day. Some things were very well and some very painful dry and formal. We came to my uncle Job Harvey’s to lodge where we had a sitting with his son’s family and with the old people and parted with them with satisfaction.
2. We came to Mount Holly Preparative Meeting and I thought we came off bravely after meeting. We visited three brothers separately, poor drunken stupid sots like to destroy themselves with strong drink, sons of H. Paxton, a valuable Friend. One of them had just before got his leg broke. And then we visited William Sleeper on account of his selling rum, launching into trade etc. to satisfaction.
3. We came to Evesham meeting, which was I thought a time of favor.
<pb id="A0011521_045"/>
Got home this afternoon and found all pretty well.
4 of the Twelfth Month, 1789. We went to the burial of Sarah Evans and had a meeting which ended pretty well. E. Collins seemed favored. Died with a swelling in her thigh. It seems a very sickly and a mortal time.
5. I was getting some firewood and taking up flax and in the afternoon my wife and I went to the burial of Edward Darling. There was for a time a silent calm and pleasant quiet attended the large gathering. He was buried near his own house. Elizabeth Collins and one more had something to say at the grave and the people seemed orderly but I have seen since that it might have been much better. Great room for improvement, more solidity and deep thoughtfulness and weightiness and life.
6. Was First Day. Went to our meeting, which was I think a favored time with me but hurt myself by hurrying. Not deliberate enough.
7. Went to get a pine tree for a pump and mended a pump for William Davidson [crossed through with notation] paid off Eleventh Month 1790; 3 s[hillings].
8. Was our preparative meeting which was a distressed poor poor poor time indeed. Did something a pump for J. Kain.
9. We went to Isaac Stite’s to put a bottom piece to his pump and I went to mend one for Isaac Armstrong. Put in a new box. [Crossed through] 5 s[hillings] 6.
10. Finished at Stite’s and made all even between us. Stopped at Joshua Robert’s to mend their pumps. [Crossed out] 1 s[hillings] 6. Then I visited our school to some satisfaction.
11. Was our monthly meeting. Robert Willis was there and Rebc Wright and both very excellent. A highly favored very large solid good meeting, though divers couples, four, passed meeting, solidity and good order was maintained till just dark.
12. We were killing hogs.
[Right marginal note] I had an opportunity amongst the women in the afternoon.
13. Was First Day. John Cox and Hannah Langdale was at our meeting.
14. About cutting up pork etc.
15. At our meeting and I thought came off pretty well, but met with a very pinching trial soon after. It seemed as if the gates of Hell and confusion opened wide before me and I found I stood in greatest need of the doctrine I communicated. *O what a world of trials, trouble and confusion, what scenes of sorrow, trouble and dissolution there is all round us! What lessons of instruction many ways and yet how we forget them. One taken away on one side and another one, one of one disorder and another another, one of a pleurisy another of a consumption, ulcers and cancers and accidents many ways and some yea many make way with themselves. Some conduct so as to get hanged – one tried last week for his life – and many now a days go crazy, lose their reason. A sorrowful instance at present of a neighbor's son Joseph Coles, lost his reason and like to have killed several in probability, so that he is now confined. A very hopeful young man hanged himself. Yesterday I heard of Job Clement’s wife had lost her reason. John Lanim’s son bad with an ulcer.
<pb id="A0011521_046"/>
16 of the Twelfth Month, 1789. A very stormy day. At work in the shop.

18. I went to take James Kain’s pump home and finished it 16 feet long and he paid for it.
19. I was mending the wagon put a new felloe in the wheel.
20. Was First Day at our meeting. Came off middling well I believe.
21. About home making sleigh runners.
22. Went to our meeting. Rather better than some of our weekday meetings. Went with A.S and R.C. and my wife to see S. Conrow. I mended John Sharp’s pump.
23. I went to look a tree for a pump for John Jessup.
24. About home.
25. My wife and I went to Cropwell Meeting, the first we were ever at of a weekday at that place and a lively good favored time it was. We went this afternoon to see Job Coles' wife who was just recovered of a spell of sickness.
26. Went to work at a pump for John Jesup in Evesham.
27. Was First Day, a stormy day. The meeting was long a gathering which was a hurt, yet I thought the meeting was favored with some solidity at last.
28. About home. Finished Jessup’s pump.
29. Samme and I went to our meeting. A most terrible stormy day of snow and rain. The meeting was very small and very poor. Abundance of rain about this time though it clears up moderate and the weather very fine warm even like spring. We have had very little cold weather as yet. About home the most of making a sled and I went with my wife to Moorestown to get her blooded and mended John Hollinshead’s pump B. S.
{1790-01}
3 of the First Month 1790, was First Day. I went to Upper Evesham meeting, which ended well to my satisfaction and as far as I could discover it was to the satisfaction of Friends in general for they seemed respectful and very kind. I heard of the burial of Uriah Moor, a young man at Lower Evesham who had been crazy several weeks and got out from the family a very stormy night, went to the creek, stripped off his greatcoat, swam through and laid down in the meadow and there perished with the cold. He was John Woolman’s sister’s son.
4. About home, turning pump boxes etc. Joseph Coles has got quite brave so as to go about his business.
5. Went to our preparative meeting the time Friends took J.W. out of meeting.
6. I went after a load of sand up in the Barrens.
7. I was very unwell.
8. We went to our Monthly. Joshua Evans was there and I find several thought it was a favored time but if it was I had but little share with them in that and no wonder for I did not keep humble and watchful enough after a time of favor. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, January 1790: "The consideration of the Extracts being resumed by reading such parts thereof as most materially require our present attention, a degree of solemnity attending under the influence thereof the Meeting proceeds to nominate the following Friends to take the same under care and report their service to this Meeting at or before the  Monthly meeting in the ninth Month next viz. John Collins, John Hunt, Abraham Warrington, John Roberts, Jacob Hollinshead, Henry Warrington, Saml Lippincott, William Roberts, William Matlack, Josa Lippincott, John Haines Junr., William Rogers, Enoch Evans, Sml Allinson, Job Haines, Sml Burrough, Saml White, Levi Ballinger, William Snowdon, Peter Andrews, Job Collins, Lawrence Webster, Josa Owen, Thomas Hollinshead, Rehoboan Bradock, Bethuel Moore, Josa Wilcox, William Rogers Junr., Isaac Griffith, Thomas Lippincott of Evesham, Solomon Haines, Sam Evans, Thomas Lippincott, Joshua Stokes and Edmund Hollinshead who agree to meet at this place next second Day Week at the tenth Hour."</note> 
9. About home at sundry little matters.
10. Was First Day. I was at our meeting, but not fully satisfied and see the cause.
11. I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting.
12. At our meeting, which was silent though not the poorest. 
<pb id="A0011521_047"/>
13:14:16 of [First Month]. About home. Abundance of wet weather. I went in the evening to John Haines’s near Lumberton.
17. Was First Day. Solomon Gaskill, J.H. and I went to Mount Holly meeting, which to me was an open favored time.
18. We came down to Evesham to a large committee meeting of about thirty-six Friends to consider the extracts. Joshua Evans was there and I think on the whole it was a lively favored time with them. 
20. About home.
21. I went to Haddonfield meeting. J [oshua] Evans had some service. A conference was held respecting the advice of the Yearly Meeting on spirituous liquors and the subject was very lively spoken to. A pretty solid time.
22 and 23. Getting some plow timber.
[Right marginal note] Joseph Coles got quite crazy again.
24. Was First Day. We went to the burial of my old aunt Elizabeth Toy, my mother’s sister. She was buried at the church. It was a very poor time with me. There seemed to be a rent in my net or a leak in the lamp that let all the oil run out. Arise and trim your lamps, is necessary. Yet when I came to look over the day I thought it a time of deep instruction and saw the necessity of dwelling in a state of more watchfulness and incessant labor so as to be in readiness for every good work.
25. I was dressing out plow stuff in the evening, was taken with a pain in my bones chills and fever followed and I have been very poorly.
26:27:28th. Got a little better.
Joseph Coles, a comely hopeful youth, has now lost his reason – again – so that they are forced to keep him chained and many such scenes of sorrow we hear of nowadays, but people choosing rather to go to the house of mirth than to the house of mourning. They seem to be soon forgotten, but were the accounts of such sorrowful instances cast together what a volume they would make. 
There was James Hollen and Uriah Moor died in that crazy condition lately. Some years ago John Matlack, after being kept chained several years died and his sister died crazy and their mother not quite right in her mind. N. Middleton’s wife died quite raving distracted. John Inskeep’s daughter, a comely young woman, being crossed in love quite lost her reason and Rachel Woolman and her sister P. Moor but she is got better. There was one Moses Haines run about many years crazy; it was supposed was killed at last. A. Hewlings sent to the hospital for a time. Got some better, but far from being right in his mind yet. And there is Jonas French and one J. Fish at this time very much disordered in mind. Some years ago Ephraim Stiles arose and heard of several more but this is but just a few that now occurs at the hospital there are great numbers seemingly in the most sorrowful crazy condition. John Hollinshead – I had like to forgot – through some cross occurrences gave way to despair, lost his reason, refused to eat and starved himself to death. There was some lost their reason by fits, viz. W. Warrington and now one in Evesham, William Snowdon’s son, a young man.
<pb id="A0011521_048"/>
31 of the First Month, 1790. I have been confined to the house with a chill and fever but got so much better as to get to meeting, though very weak in body. It was a very much favored time with me. 
{1790-02}
1 of the Second Month. About home.
3. Was our preparative meeting. I came off middling I believe.
3 and 4. John Collins, brother Joshua and I went to visit a sad drunken family and a tavern keeper and storekeeper. There seemed to be but little impression to be made, though we endeavored to clear ourselves. I mended H. Cowperthwait’s pump. 
3-5. About home very poorly.
5. Was monthly meeting. ] I met a committee at 9th hour on spirituous liquors which was a pretty lively time and I hope to profit. Meeting came on. The first sitting was silent and I have thought since that I and the whole meeting suffered loss for want of my not communicating what opened to me. Just before the meeting parted this and one other matter which was worse I apprehend was the cause why we had a most miserable poor dull time. I had not satisfaction. Only a little time amongst the women and one sentence amongst the men. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, February 1790: "The Committee nominated last Month on the Extracts reported that there were several matters contained therein by way of recommendation, which, altho they do not particularly require an Ans: to Superior Meetings and therefore not apprehended to come under their immediate attention, thet appear of such importance as to induce them to spread the same before this Meeting for further solid attention, which being obtained, it appeared the sense thereof, that the same be now submitted to the following Committee to proceed therein as they may be enabled in the Wisdom of Truth, and report their service to this Meeting in the 8th mo next, viz. Joseph Roberts, John Haines Senr., William Rogers, John Collins, Saml Allinson, Joshua Lippincott, Job Collins, John Haines (of upper Evesham), Job Haines, Josa Owen, and John Hunt: Who agree to meet at this place next second Day Week, at the tenth Hour." Also report of the Committee on the State of the Society.</note> 
6. Very cold. About home.
7. Was First Day. I was at our meeting.
8. I went to Isaac Armstrong’s to finish a top piece of his pump, 16 feet long and 5 s[hillings] 6 [pence] the mending before which makes in all [crossed through with notation] all paid now; 37 s[hillings] 6 [pence].
9. Went to our meeting. Grace Bocanon had some service to advantage.
10. At work at a pump for John Ridgaway here at home.
11. We went to the burial of William Matlack’s youngest daughter about 18 years of age. We held a meeting. I thought it but a low time both at the house and at the meeting though the meeting was better at last and ended pretty well.
12. My wife and I went to Cropwell Meeting and thought it was pretty well though room for great improvement.
13. Getting some plow stuff home etc.
14. Was First Day we was at our meeting I hope we came off without loss.
15. I went to Evesham to a committee meeting of men and women Friends appointed to consider the state of society and to have the care thereof as it was recommended from the Yearly Meeting in the extracts concerning the neglect of meetings, drowsiness, deviation respecting plainness, Friends living above their ability, bankruptcies faithfulness respecting our testimony against war and paying taxes for the support or to defray the expense thereof etc. and it was a very lively favored close searching time. The meeting held about five hours and none seemed weary or restless. At last it was concluded for the committee of each meeting to join and assist the overseers and meet once a month and proceed to a private labor as way might open till the time of adjournment in the Eighth Month next. Joshua Evans was here.
16. Went to our meeting. John Cox was there. The meeting low at forepart, but ended pretty well I hope.
[Right marginal note] At [Mount] Holly I had with William Sleeper a time of conference about selling rum again to satisfaction.
17. [crossed through with notation “all paid off now"] I went to take a pump home to Mount Holly for John Ridgeway 29 long at 1s[hillings] 6 a foot and 7s[hillings] 6 the boxes, the timber and hauling 20 shilling makes 71 shillings and he now paid 15 shillings the rest remains due to me.
<pb id="A0011521_049"/>
18th of the Second month 1790. On my return from Mount Holly I stopped at Evesham meeting. John Tatham was there and John had good service I believe, and I thought there was something savory and a pretty pleasant feeling over the meeting at last.
Last week and for some time before we had a spell of very sharp freezing weather and directly after it moderated a very heavy thundershower the lightning and the thunder was very sharp and heavy and coming in the middle of the night it was very awful alarming and unexpected.
19 and 20. About home at work in the shop about plow stuff etc. From some cross occurrences and perplexing things I met with a very close trial and stood it but poorly. I find the caution to one formerly is very needful to be remembered. Take heed to thyself etc. lest I become a castaway and make shipwreck of faith etc. <note resp="transcr">I Timothy 1:19</note> .
The gate seemed to open that leads to blackness and darkness forever. But the way to heaven is said be by the gate of Hell, not go in at them, but if ye do, we should, like the earnest traveler when he gets into a wrong road turn, back at once and get into the right one as soon as he can. 
In war, if men can get in between their enemies and their storehouse they sometimes make great conquests. And so it is in a spiritual relation. When the enemy gets in between us and the inexhaustible fountain, we really have to walk in and stand on slippery places. It may well be compared to a sea of glass mingled with fire.
21. Was First Day. Before I got up, my mind was turned to this passage of scripture, Isaiah 58 and 13: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord Honorable and shall honor him not doing thine own ways and finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words. 14: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed the with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken." 
I went to our meeting and a poor time it was with me, though Rebekah Roberts had some acceptable service.
22. About home at work in the shop.
23. Went to our meeting in which I was favored with a renewal of strength but met with a trial that disturbed my mind very soon after. But it went off and I went to visit the school with many other Friends at Moorestown and it was a satisfactory time at last.
24. I went to see Theodocia Vinicomb who was very weak and low. Joshua Lippincott, Samuel Coles and I stopped at Thomas Hollinshead and had a sitting with them to good satisfaction though it was very unexpected and seemed to me providential, his wife being then in great trouble on account of burying her daughter.
25. At home dressing out plow stuff.
26. And about home in the shop.
27. This afternoon I met Joshua Lippincott, Rebekah Roberts and Esther Hunt brother Joshua’s wife at Hinchman Bispham’s by appointment from our last monthly meeting. We had a sitting with them. The way opened to communicate very suitable council but there was not that life I could have wished to have felt, though no cause of complaint. Some cross occurrences and perplexing things had a tendency to spot, stain and defile the temple this week. More watchfulness is wanting and patience.
<pb id="A0011521_050"/>
28. Was First Day. We went to our meeting which was very full crowded and inany [irony?] apprehension, but a low poor time. But it is no wonder it was so with me and indeed with others. The careless indifferency luke-warmness and erase that prevails and idleness.
{1790-03}
1st of the Third Month 1790. About home.
2. Was our preparative meeting. Joshua Evans was there. The meeting in the forepart was very dull and poor but Joshua got up after a while and gave us home spun. I thought it exceeded anything I ever heard him do in my life. I thought I saw a prospect of his making an advancement or an improvement in his gift. But our preparative meeting was a most miserable poor time, indeed as it mostly has been of latter time answering queries.
I heard a few days ago that Levi Bud in Philadelphia cut his own throat and was buried last week. and that two school boys in Philadelphia had some difference and one pulled out his knife and stabbed the other in his arm, cut the vein and it killed him immediately. Levi Bud was crazy, lost his reason for some time before. To realize and bring such scenes of sorrow Chest [?] home how terrible it must be
[Right marginal note later by ink] George Bud cut his throat at Long-a-Coming. Four instances of the like near one time in Pennsylvania.
3 and 4. At work at plow work.
5. Was monthly meeting. The Committee on Spirituous Liquors met and gave in some account of their stewardship tending to strength. monthly meeting came on. Joshua Evans was there and was much favored with weighty service. The first sitting concluded with a good degree of solid weight and the business was a pretty good lively time. The abundance of business holding till just night rather hurt the service. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1790: "Our Friends John Hunt and Elizabeth Collins opened to this Meeting a concern that had for a considerable time impressd their Minds to pay a religious visit to some of the families of Friends within the compass of upper Greenwich and Pilesgrove particular Meetings; requesting our unison and concurrence therein, which after mature deliberation was obtained: Our Friend Grace Rogers informing that she found her Mind so far united with them in the service as to bear them company therein, with which the Meeting writes desiring they may be enabled to perform said visit to the honour of Truth and their own peace. The Clk. is directed to furnish them with a Copy of this Minutes and sign it on behalf of the Meeting."</note> 
6. Was our Select Meeting. Joshua Evans and David Cooper was there and it was on the whole a good profitable meeting. Joshua was remarkably favored, I think. Certainly his master has given him a new lesson, or put a new song in his mouth.
8. Was First Day at our meeting. Elizabeth Collins was there. I thought the meeting ended pretty well. William Rogers and wife and E. Collins came here and we went the 8 to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. Robert Willis was there and was favored. Elizabeth Collins, Grace Rogers and myself on 9 went to Woodbury Monthly Meeting. R.W. and E.C. had good service. 
[9] <note resp="transcr">Woodbury Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1790- "Our friend John Hunt produced a Minute from the Monthly Meeting of Evesham, dated the 4th of 3rd Mo 1790, signifying "that he, together with our friend Elizabeth Collins had expressed a concern that had for a considerable time impressed their minds to pay a religious visit to some of the Families of friends within the compass of Upper Greenwich particular Meeting: and that Grace Rogers had found it on her mind to accompany them;" which being read, this Meeting unites therewith.- And David Cooper expressing a willingness to accompany them, the Meeting concurs therewith."</note> 
10. David Cooper, Grace Rogers, E. Collins and I went down to Mullica Hill to visit families having the full unity of our Friends at first sitting: Edward Panocost’s – not in unity but a very good time, to Aaron Pancost's – Elizabeth Collins was highly favored, then to the widow Lippincott’s to lodge. This was a dipping striping time with me for some hours yet came off brave at last. A very great snow fell and it had been very exceeding cold just before several days. A man froze to death near Byberry at this time. 
<pb id="A0011521_051"/>
11 of the Third Month 1790. We went in a sleigh six miles to Upper Greenwich meeting. A poor hard time it was, but I hope ended with degree of life. We came to William Hollinshead's to dine and had a sitting, to Garrot Gruf’s, then to Thomas Enoch's to lodge. Had a sitting. 
12. To Joshua Moore’s, Levi Stratton's (two families), Samuel French’s Dined and had a sitting with them, then to widow Ellis Thomas [illegible] and to Joseph Allen's to lodge.
13. To Benjamin Moore’s, Benjamin Moors, Jr., then to Job Ridgeway's, then to Job Kelle’s, William Matlack’s, and then to George Colson's to lodge.
14. Was First Day. We went to Piles Grove meeting which to me was a poor time and no wonder. There was a plain reason for it. Dined at George Colson's, had a sitting with them. Then to Joseph Ridgeway and one Hosman with their wives, two young couples together, a favored sweet time. Lodged Enoch Allen’s.
15. Went to Joseph Zane’s, James Casaday’s not in membership, a favored time, Thomas Sharp’s, then to their school, came off pretty well, Amos Wille’s, Abel Nicholson’s, Matthew Allen’s, Chattin Zane’s, to Enoch Allen’s to lodge.
16. Went to the widow Strattan’s -- two families together, Samuel Brakny’s, I. Zane’s – his wife he was gone out, William Eldrige dined, and then to Isaac Zane’s and Enoch Eldrige’s together. Then we came up to David Cooper’s and lodged at Anthony Allen’s – had a sitting.
17. Came up to John Hurlies. Had a sitting with his wife and he was gone out from home. Then we came up to my house and found all pretty well. We had been nearly united together in the labor and although at times had some baptizing seasons of deep dipping and poverty of spirit so that I was ready to adopt the language of old, see Isaiah 2:19 who so dumb and blind as I. Yet we generally met with a very open reception and were often favored with very good sweet satisfactory times in families and on the whole it was a very favored strengthening time, I having had a prospect of a visit of this sort a considerable time past to the people of this place, many of whom came from our parts to settle here and many of them stood in a disunited state, one of the heads of the family a right and the other not. <note resp="transcr"> Journal expands "one of the heads of the family having a right among Friends, and the other not," 258.</note>  And now upon looking back at our visit I feel no uneasiness of mind about anything we have done or left undone, but true peace and solid satisfaction.
18:19:20: Made several plows.
21. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and I thought it was a highly favored time with me. A solid good meeting, yet not without great room for improvement. Some misses and some hits.
23. At our meeting. E. Langdal was there and did very well but not so with me. No satisfaction but far from it.
24. At work at home making a plow.
25. Went to our Select Meeting at Haddonfield. To me a poor dull dry time.
26. Was Quarterly Meeting. Forepart was low, but Samuel Hopkins and Daniel Offley was favored in the exercise of their gifts and the first sitting ended pretty well. That for business I thought but middling.
27. I did not go to Select Meeting at Philadelphia as usual but was at work at a pump and went to see D. Davies who is very ill.
<pb id="A0011521_052"/>
28th of the Third Month 1790. I was at our meeting. To me at last was a favored time Tip Top Tap Lash[?] About this time we heard of several very suddenly snatched away. One Walker, an old woman was taken with a pain in her thumb and died in a few hours and another towards Salem died very suddenly.
29. I went to Philadelphia to Select Meeting, all well.
30. Went to our meeting, which was a very poor low time.

{1790-04}
1 of the Fourth Month and 2 and 3. A very great rain. A work at home making several plows.
4. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting and a time of favor I think it was. A good solid meeting. Went in the afternoon to a Negro meeting at Evesham which was a poor hard time to me, though Elizabeth Collins had good service. I.L. says I did very well but I did not please myself.
5. At work at plow making.
6. Was preparative meeting. I had an unpleasant talk on the subject of a spirit of slumber.
7 and 8. About home at work at plow making.
9. Was monthly meeting which on the whole I think was not to be complained of. A pretty lively good meeting. John Collins and I were sent in amongst the women to confer with them respecting men and women sitting down in their apartments at monthly meeting and from that got on the subject of holding of wedding or accomplishing marriages. Came off with satisfaction.
10. About home plow making. This afternoon my wife and I, Elizabeth Evans, and Abraham Warrington went over the river to see our kinsman Joseph Thorington in a poor lingering state of health. Here we found divers valuable Friends.
11. Was First Day. We went to Byberry meeting where was a number of choice Friends, viz. the Irish women Friends Mary Ridgeway and Jane Watson, John Pemberton, Nicholas Waln, and James Thorington and yet the meeting the forepart was low and poor, but Mary Ridgeway. After a while was favored in the exercise of her most sweet and beautiful gift. This afternoon, these Friends had a sitting at Joseph Thorington’s. Jane Watson spoke very well. We came home this evening.
12. About home.
13. About home plow making. Was a marriage at our meeting, Edmund Darnel and Rac Dudley which was but a very poor time to me. The sun seemed to be eclipsed to Earth. It’s to be feared had covered divers wretched worldlings there. O Earth, Earth! Hear o Earth!) This afternoon, we mended F. Porter’s and N. Middleton’s pump.
14 and 15. Making plows.
16 and 17. We made a pump for Daniel Offley in Evesham, 20 feet 8 inches long. All settled and paid off.

19. About a plow etc.
20. At our meeting. I think it was a time of favor with me.
21:22:23. About a plow making. Met with a most piercing trial so that it seemed as if I was within one step of ruin and disgrace. It went off and I felt like a bird escaped out of the hands of the fowler.
24. I went to mend a pump for Joshua Bispham.
25. Was First Day. Wrote a letter to the Negro master this morning in Pennsylvania. A most sore trying time I had again and stood it but poorly. A poor meeting this afternoon. My wife and I and A. Warrington and Martha Dudley went to see Samuel Franklin, a tavern keeper to good or pretty good satisfaction. They received us freely and parted kindly, though they not in membership.
26. Plow making etc.
27. Was at our meeting. A favored healing time. seemed to set all to rights in the true resting place.
<pb id="A0011521_053"/>
27:28:29:30th. About home plow making etc. Nothing material except this: Gideon Burroughs, one of my old schoolmates was killed with a tree falling on him. Hurt him over the hips and back so that he lived but a few hours, but very sensible to the last and reflected much on his misspent time and past conduct. It is to be feared he was very much unprepared. Samuel Burroughs Jr. was buried a few days ago of a short illness.
{1790-05}
2nd of the Fifth Month. Was First Day. We went to our meeting. Came off pretty well. This afternoon Rebekah Roberts and R. Cowerthwait and Joshua Roberts and I went to visit several young new married people. Dined at Jacob Hollinshead’s. Went to Jac. Holn. Jr. then to John Haines’s. It was very hard laboring but maybe best we were there. Some satisfaction.
3 and 4. Was preparative meeting, which was some better than common but great room to meeted.
5 and 6. About home.
7. Was monthly meeting. Joshua Evans was there. But a lowish time. life was wanting, though it might have been worse and much better. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, May 1790: "Joshua Lippincott on behalf of the Committee on Spiritous Liquors proposed for consideration the appointment of Meetings for conference on that subject for herein might be revived several Minutes of Discipline suitably adapted to the occasion, which after attention given united the Meeting in the appointment of one at each particular Meeting which constitute this, to be held the Week preceding the Preparative Meetings; and Enoch Evans, William Rogers, John Hunt, John Collins, Joshua Lippincott, and John Haines of upper Evesham are appointed to select such minutes as is proposed, attend said Meetings and report their sense thereon to next Meeting."</note> 
8. Was Select Meeting, a low dull time though we had some close labor about it and it ended better. This afternoon J. Evans and I went to see a Scotchman in Evesham on account of his selling rum to the poor drunken people. He received us with great openness and treated us kindly and we had a full opportunity to satisfaction. We lodged at Caleb Evans' and a sitting with them and no cause to repent it.
9. Was First Day. We went to Cropwell Meeting which was at first a very heavy dull time to me for a while, but it growed better. This afternoon, I went to Negro meeting which was very dull and poor at first. Hard, hard labor, but I thought it growed better after a while and I hope ended pretty well.
10:11. Was at our meeting.
12 and 13. About home.
14. After finishing a plow I set off with John Collins to Salem Quarterly Meeting lodged at David Brown’s.
15. Rode twenty-two miles to Salem Select Meeting. John Simpson was there and had good service. What right have we to demand a full spread table more than the children? was some of his words. It was a dull poor time.
16. Was First Day. I was at Salem meeting both forenoon and afternoon meeting, which were both exceeding dull heavy poor though, maybe to some of us very profitable meetings. In the first, Mary Newbold had good service very lively and likewise John Simpson so I thought we just escaped the scoffer. The afternoon was more dull and poor.
17. Quarterly Meeting came on which was but low at first, but in the afternoon it was a fine lively time and especially respecting the use of spirituous liquors. Great unity appeared and we seemed to go on conquering and to conquer.
18. youth’s meeting or Yearly Meeting at Salem came on, which was a good meeting and ended solid savory and well. Then John Collins and I set off and came home. I got home about the 11 hour at night. At Salem we had settings in the families in most places where we dined and lodged and some to very good satisfaction.
<pb id="A0011521_054"/>

[Left marginal note] First Day
24. Shearing sheep etc.
25. At our meeting. A little better.
26. I went with Joseph Warrington to the burial of Joseph Thornton over to Byberry. A large concourse of people and a large number of valuable ministers, to wit James Thornton, John Pemberton, Samuel Emlen, Nicholas Waln, Samuel Wilson, Thomas Scattergood, John Parrish, Samuel Gomery and myself at meeting. But no good was scattered. A very dull silent poor meeting. I came home this evening with Enoch Evans. At the house after dinner, Thomas Scattergood and Samuel Emlen had good lively service.
27:28 and 29. About home making several plows and some screws for cheese presses etc.
30. Was First Day. I was poorly but at our meeting. A very poor time.

{1790-06}
1 of the Sixth Month. Went to our meeting. Joshua Evans was there. A conference held and some ancient advices and minutes were read respecting the use of spirituous liquors, I hope to good advantage though many seem to hang back too much. About this time there was a man killed at Darby with a standard of a wagon, a difference between two about the tax etc.
2. I went to Upper Evesham to attend on the subject of spirituous liquors in company with Joshua Evans pursuant to the direction of our Quarterly and monthly meeting. It was thought to be a solid time and the matter weightily and feelingly spoken to. 	
[Right marginal note] Samuel French died with the pleurisy at C.F.
3. We, that is Joshua Evans and me, attended Lower Evesham and had a very solid favored time. I thought and find I was not alone in that opinion. The testimony was raised into dominion over all.
4. I was very unwell and could not attend at Cropwell this day. Have been very poorly all the week and grow more so with a disorder called the influenza, a very general and common complaint at this time. In meeting I don’t remember that I felt poorly, only hoarse like a bad cold, but out of meeting could hardly set up or keep of my bed.
5. About home very poorly.
6. Was First Day. I went to our meeting and I think it was a highly favored time with me.
7. About home.
8. Was our preparative meeting and miserable poor time it was I think.
9 and 10. About a cheese press for H. Bispham.
11. Was monthly meeting which was but dull at times but some pretty smart work especially amongst the women. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, June 1790: "The Meeting appointed to attend the Meetings for conference appointed last Month, reported they were held agreeable thereto, and to a good degree of satisfaction."</note> 
12. About home.

23 and 24. We were making a pump for Samuel Shute 17 and a half [feet] long paid all off.
25 and 26. About home at plow.
27. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and do believe it was a pretty good meeting to me. A time of favor if I am not mistaken. Aunt Mary Harvey came to see us.
28. About home mending fence. Warm weather, hard labor and I not very well.
29. At our meeting and a most miserable grievous poor time it was.
30. At home.
{1790-07}
1. I went to Haddonfield on business of several sorts. I was at Haddonfield meeting at which was a conference on the subject of the use of spirits etc. Some former minutes and advices was read, but it was a very poor low time, a small meeting, things very low to what it should be, yet I had a hope some good was done. Divers which ought to be foremost seemed very fearful of going too fast and they seemed an over balance for a number that stand fair in the work.
2 of the Seventh Month, Sixth of the week. I was at Cropwell Meeting. A busy time of year. The meeting very small and my wife thinks to her but poor and low, but I think I got pay for the time and labor, though I had to walk home on foot.
3. About hay and I thought was the better for the labor of yesterday.
4. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and I thought it was a highly favored time to me. See Psalms 138:17: How precious also are thy thoughts unto me Oh God. How great is the sum of them etc. Visited two families this afternoon with J.C.. R.R. and  [illegible]
[Left marginal note] I and R.R. and J.C. and R.C. visited E. Hollinshead and S. Lan families to some satisfaction
5. About hay.
6. At our meeting-- preparative. A very very poor miserable but very little life to be felt or seen from end to end except a little at last.
7. About plowing corn.
8. I went to Newtown Meeting which was very small and very poor. There seemed to be nothing if not worse than nothing at all.
9. Was monthly meeting. Thomas Vickes was there and spoke very well. The Meeting for Business I thought was but a poor time. Its harvest time; our meetings are generally small and very drowsy.
10. Reaping.
11. Was First Day. I went Evesham meeting and thought I came off pretty well this afternoon was the meeting for Black people. Thomas Vickers and Elizabeth Collins was there. E.C. had some service but it was a very poor dull time to me except toward the last it was better.
12. About Mowing, getting hay etc.
13. Went to our meeting. Thomas Vickers was there and I thought I had good service on the subject of the nature of the gospel of Christ. Peace on Earth and good will amongst men. I had a satisfactory time, also my Friends owned me.
18. Was First Day, a poor low meeting. I went with Joshua and R. Roberts to visit William Burr and his wife newly settled.
<pb id="A0011521_056"/>
19. About hay and getting in harvest and all this week.
20. At our meeting a Methodist. A very solid sober looking man. I heard afterwards he was a minister. A poor time, not satisfactory to me.
21. Getting hay.
25. Was First Day. Went to our meeting which was a satisfactory time to me. I thought there was something solemn and quieting at last.
26. My wife and I attended a committee meeting in order to draw up an account to send forward to our superior meetings. Friends of the different committees had lively accounts to give in of their care and attention on the several cases to which they were appointed, to wit on spirituous liquors, the case of the Blacks, and on schools. Though life did not arise as I could have wished for, yet not much cause of complaint.
27. Was our weekday meeting. A very miserable poor full time it was. About hay etc.
28 and 29. About hay etc.
30. I was at Cropwell Meeting, a poor low time.
31. About home, sundry matters.
{1790-08}
1 of the Eighth Month. Was First Day. At our meeting. A poor time with me. Search for the cause. Went to the burial of Daniel Heritage’s wife this afternoon. A low poor time much so. 
[Right marginal note] I am told D. Heritage’s wife was resigned and willing to die favored.
2. About a cheese press for William Matlack.
3. At our preparative meeting. Elizabeth Collins was there but says sumptuously she did not fare a poor time.
The rest of this week we was making a lower part for Samuel Heritage’s [Xing through begins; notation "all settled”] pump 30 feet long [crossed out] and finished both that and the press and went to monthly meeting, which was was the forepart pretty well but there was a matter which very much hurt the meeting at last Is[?] Wit. Case.
8. Was First Day. I went to Evesham Meeting which seemed very low and weak, many very raw. I thought I labored after a state of resignation and it was a favored time. At last I had sweet satisfaction and the people was very respectful and pleasant when we came out. See Barclay’s Apology, page 353 and so on several pages on silent meetings, ministry etc. <note resp="transcr">Robert Barclay, An Apology for the True Christian Divinity. Philadelphia: Joseph James, 1789.</note>  I went this afternoon to visit T.D. Had a full opportunity with him in company with my Friend Joshua Owin concerning his neglect of meetings and the use of spirituous liquors but seemed no impressions to be made.
9. About home.
10. At our meeting. A low poor dull time. The rest of this week, nothing material unless it was this: divers things and some very trying vexing and perplexing tending to disquiet discompose and disturb the mind, which to escape and prevent requires great watchfulness circumspection and care truly to preserve the vessel clean or to steer to straight, that when we look back as not to see where we have missed our way, or not made quite strait steps to our feet. 
I was at market which seems like a place of confusion to me, or like disturbed troubled muddy waters. Though I had a little time with a couple of sweet spirited Friends J. Parrish and T. Scattergood at their houses. Scattergood is gone up to Cropwell. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see <note resp="transcr"> Matthew 5:8</note> .
<pb id="A0011521_057"/>
15th of the Eighth Month, 1790. Was First Day I and my wife and children a wagon load of us went to Cropwell Meeting. Thomas Scattergood was there. The meeting was at first or forepart very low and poor but growed better Thomas Scattergood had good service, especially amongst the youth some of whom I believe were reached and tendered and some close scraping work amongst the fore rank.
16. My wife and I met some Friends at Moorestown. Consulted together and divided ourselves into three companies and proceeded to visit some families that were dilatory or neglectful of attending of meetings. H. French and her son R., my wife, and I went to J. Hack, Joel Middleton’s, and Jh Dudley’s. We found dull hard work but tried to do as well as we could and I have a hope and belief there will be a use in this labor, tending to strengthen the visitors and stir up the careless and negligent.
17. Was our weekday meeting Benjamin Jones and John Cox was there. B.J. said nothing but John did speak very well.
18. I was about home and 19-20-21 went to hew a pump for D. Haines.
22. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and believe it was rather a better meeting than it is common for us to have. Something solid and satisfactory to me.
23. At work at D. Haines [crossed through with notation] Twelfth Month paid all off; pump 19 long.
24 and 25. I went to work at a press for T. Hollinshed.
26. I got up about 3 o’clock in the morning and set off with Samuel White to the Quarterly Meeting at the Falls in Pennsylvania, about seven miles beyond Burlington or Bristol. Got there in good season. John Lloyd had good service in the first sitting and in the meeting for business there was something good and lively at times, but it seemed to me there was not industry enough to keep it or to keep to the life and it was very troublesome. Contentious men come in with their appeals at last and the meeting thereby much hurt and hardly ended in good order. Lodged at Jonathan Kirkbright’s.
27. Was their youth’s meeting. Rebekah Wright was there, Hannah Wilson, and divers others, but the service as to ministry fell to John Lloyd and Benjamin Linton who I thought did very well, but it was a distressing poor dull time to me. A large concourse of people but very idle as to a true labor for spiritual bread. Though I believe there is a few names there preserved, yea many, though few compared to the whole or what I should be. We came home as far as brother J. Buzby’s was stopped, a hard rain, lightning etc.
[Right marginal note] At this time as we sit in Joseph Buzby’s there was a very sharp lightning and by account a terrible time in Pennsylvania. Storm tore down houses.
[Left marginal note] I had a sitting in a Thoms his family. John Simpson was there. Came off pretty well.
28. I was at brother Joshua Hunt’s vendue. I thought the people live as orderly.
29. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. I thought the meeting sat very solid and was middling well. When I was over the river at the fall Quarterly Meeting, I heard that the grasshoppers were so thick in places that they eat up the clover and J. Simpson said they were so thick last summer in New England that they destroyed the corn and eat up the cabbage to the very stumps in places and was informed that the like account is now in the newspapers in New England.
30. I was making top piece for Ind. Matlack’s pump 10 feet.
31. At our meeting. Something lively. My wife thinks however [leaves off there].

{1790-09}
1st of the Ninth Month, 1790, Fourth of the week. I went to Upper Evesham Meeting appointed for Peter Yarnall. There was something calming, sweet and solemn covered the meeting from the very first to last. Peter had very extensive service and to me it was a satisfactory meeting.
[Right marginal note] Peter labored till he sweat like a mower.
This afternoon Peter had another meeting at Lower Evesham. I thought there seemed something like a cloud to cover at first and was soon confirmed. Peter stood up and said it’s a cloudy time both inwardly and outwardly. Clouds of thick darkness have spread themselves and so went on. Said he expected to have hard labor amongst them. A scraping threshing time it was.
[Right marginal note] This is going to the both of things said one.
2. Peter Yarnall was at our meeting. Peter had a great deal to say, but I thought there was not the door of entrance as I could wish, though Peter was eminently raised in the exercise of his gift. I dined at brother J. Warrington with P. and brother A.W., Wr. R. and Jna Cox.
3 and 4. Made a pump for Jn. Ostler 24 feet long. He paid three dollars. All paid now. 
5. Was First Day. Cousin P. Ellis was here and wife. At our meeting I thought the people sat very still and commendable, but to me it was but so so indifferent. This afternoon divers Friends had a sitting with brother Joshua Hunt’s family. They were just going off next day off to Redstone to settle.
6. I was About a pump for the widow after 21 feet. Samme and Job finished it next day. She Paid 15 s[hillings]. [Later addition] 1791 Ninth Month paid of all<italic>.</italic>
7. I was at our preparative meeting. A tugging time but I hope to profit.
8. I went to John Smith’s to hew a top piece for his pump.
9. From the stump [?] this day we took a white oak tree and made a [crossed out; notation "Twelfth Month paid all off”] pump 18 feet long for Daniel Zille.
10. Was our monthly meeting. Samuel Lawrence was there, a disturber of meetings. The business was to me but a low laborious time, but I got pay at last and came off with satisfaction.
11. I did something at a pump, both before and after our Select Meeting, for John Smith. Our select meeting, though close hard labor to me, in the end was a strengthening time and satisfactory.
12. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting I think in the end was a time of favor to me at least. I was at the Negro meeting this afternoon and a distressing dull heavy time it was to me (I was unwell). But Elizabeth Collins had good service among the Negroes and the meeting ended reputably. Its a query whither I did not miss it in not going to John Lanin’s burial this afternoon. I was with him several times in his illness. He died with a swelling on the pit of his stomach.
13. I went to finish John Smith’s pump 12 feet 6 inches long.
14. Went to our meeting, which seemed like lost time to me. No satisfaction.
15. About home the rest of this week. About home sowing etc. 
<pb id="A0011521_059"/>
19. Was First Day. I was at our meeting, which was some disturbed by one a little unsettled in mind, though I hope the meeting ended middling well at last.
20. Plow making.
21. At our meeting. Robert Willis was there. The meeting was much disturbed again by the same person, R.S., but Robert had a good deal to say at last and I believe hit several states.
22. I went to hew a beam for Joseph Warrington’s cider press.
23. I went to our Select Meeting of ministers and elders at Haddonfield. John Simpson was there and had excellent extensive service. A scraping smart lively time to my satisfaction in a good degree.
24. Was Quarterly Meeting. Peter Yarnall had good service this day in the first meeting and John Simpson much so in the last. Daniel Offley and divers others a pretty smart lively. I went this evening to I. Kain’s to lodge.
25. I was at our Select Meeting at Philadelphia. James Thorington had close searching service toward ministers. John Lloyd and one of the women from Ireland also. Adjourned Select Meeting Fourth Day morning. I came home with J.R. and E. Evans.
26. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. A favored time. I think it was a solid good meeting. Here comes on our Yearly Meeting.
27. My wife and Samme and I went down to the Yearly Meeting, a narrative of which I kept in my pocket.
{1790-10}
3rd of the Tenth Month, First Day. I came up to our meeting with J. Warrington and several others. Mary Newbold was there and spoke most sweet and excellent and I think I had a favored time. A good satisfactory meeting. I do think the critic, scoffer and gainsayer was put to silence if any was there. It’s a favor we come of with any degree of reputation.
4. I was very unwell having taken a bad cold.
5. I went to our meeting though hardly able to set up. Rebekah Wright was there and Alice Needham from New England and Benjamin Swet and his wife and we had abundance of preaching till I began to think of Exodus 36:7: For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it and too much.
6 and 7. I was about home a good deal unwell, trimming some casks etc.
8. Was monthly meeting. Alice Needham from New England was there, Benjamin Swet and his wife and upon the whole I do think it was a very lively open good meeting to my satisfaction in a good degree. I thought the strangers had good service amongst us.
10. Was First Day. We went a wagon load of us to our meeting. A very stormy day and I thought it was but a poor time. The meeting was disturbed by Rac Shute.
11. I went to Lawrence Webster’s to mend his pump.
12. Finished and come home. I went in company with Elizabeth Collins and divers others to visit H.S. which was a time some of us won’t soon forget, I believe, though not satisfactory. The rest of this week about home.
<pb id="A0011521_060"/>
18th of the Tenth Month, 1790. First Day. At our meeting. Not so satisfactory as some a little back.
19. About home laying out flax etc.
20. At our meeting. Joshua Evans was there forepart. Joshua Evans had good service but it did not end so well as I could wish and I think seen where the miss was. Instant in seasons, as J. Cox said to me once in meetings. I don't know whether I have not had the messenger of Satan to buffet me of late. Great heights end in great depths etc. We have had some favored meetings. Some weeks past it seemed as if I could not bear the cumber and care of so large a family which seemed to haul me down into the earth or earthly concerns. About home the rest of this week gathering winter apples etc.
24. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. Robert Willis was there, Aaron Wills and wife. I thought I came off pretty well satisfied. Robert was silent. I went to William Rogers to dine. Spent the afternoon very pleasantly with the Friends but upon retrospection think we might spent it better. William Rogers and I in the evening went to Job Haines and there had a sitting, so I went to see the widow Jaskill who lay very ill with a cancer. All her nose is quite eat away with it and she not like to live long.
25. About our corn etc.
26. At our meeting which was not satisfactory to me. More charity or something is wanting.
27 and 28. About husking corn etc.
28. My wife and I with brother Roberts wife went to Cropwell Meeting which was a time of favor to me and strengthening but as Mercy Redman once said: when we have been at a religious meeting and have had our minds seasoned with the seasoning virtue of truth let us endeavor to retain it I have found it difficult say she to retain it I could not discover that I was a burthen to the living: so pass along.
[Left marginal note] We went to E. Hooton’s and S. Stokes
30. Was First Day. Abraham Griffe was there and was favored as we thought in the exercise of his gift.
{1790-11}
1st of the Eleventh Month, 1790. About our corn.
2. Was preparative meeting. A distressing poor time to me.
3 and 4. About our corn.
5. Was monthly meeting. John Simpson, Abram Griffe, and Thomas Vickers was there. John had very excellent extensive service. I think he beats every thing as it is common to say but in this case perhaps the most proper.
6. Was Select Meeting. John Simpson had very edifying good service amongst us.
7. Was First Day. Thomas Vickers and John Cox was there. Thomas and John both spoke and I find it was the united opinion of several that it was pretty satisfactory.
8. About getting in our corn.
[Right marginal note] On First Day afternoon I was with Thomas Vickers and other Friends at R. Smith’s, John Matlack’s, and Samuel Coles. The last was pretty well.
9. I was with Thomas Vickers at Robert Howey’s and Samuel Lanin’s on a family visit. Came off pretty well, though the waters seemed low. Then went to meeting. Solomon Gaskill and Samuel Shin was there on their return from a visit in Pennsylvania. Solomon had good service, said a great deal and Samuel Shin seemed pleasant and cheerful, though his barn was burnt with the lightning a few nights ago whilst he was out with Solomon. I seemed unexpected released from Friends in their family visit. The rest of this week about getting in corn etc.
14. Was First Day. My wife Abigail Stokes and I set off to Salem. Was at Woodbury meeting which I thought was but low. I went to see John Laning, a young man much wounded with a blow on his head in a difference with one Fleming. I seen the doctor cut away the flesh, scrape the skull and bore a hole through the skull. We went as far as Benjamin Wright’s.
15. Was at Quarterly at Salem. John Simpson had good service in meeting of business in the other was but little said.
<pb id="A0011521_061"/>
Lodged at Mark Millers.
16. Was youth’s meeting at Salem. Benjamin Reeve and Daniel Offley spoke. Daniel was very large. We came up as far as Christopher Smith through a hard rain. Many Friends was there. A house almost full. Some young people. We had a sitting to good satisfaction.
17. We came up with James Cooper and his mother as far as their house and lodged. The storm still continued very hard. Had a sitting at Cooper’s I hope.
18. Come on our way home. Stopped to see John Laning. The doctors were dressing his head and there seemed a prospect of his recovering. We went to cousin James Whitall’s to dine and had an opportunity tended to the increase of true unity and so to good satisfaction. Then home and found all well.
19 and 20. About making a new screw to our cider press.
21. Was First Day at our meeting Thomas Vickers was there and think had a good service. Pretty solid good meeting, I thought. Joshua Roberts and his wife and I visited Isaac Dudley’s and Jacob Hollinshead family in company with Thomas Vickers.
22. I was about home. Thomas Vickers on his family visit with Josha Roberts and wife and Jacob Hollinshead Jr. family in company with Thomas Vickers 
22. I was about home. Thomas Vickers on his family visit with Joshua Roberts and wife. And Jacob Hollinshead, Sr., had a sitting at our house which was a time of favor in some good degree.
23. I went with Thomas Vickers on a family visit first to Dorcas Haines’s, not a professor with us, who had requested a visit and received us very openly and I think we came off bravely. There was a man from Virginia there and sat with us who was looking for a Negro with him. We had an opportunity, then to Joshua Lippincott’s and he went with us to Samuel Allinson’s, John Haines’s, then to Joshua Lippincott's to lodge.
24. We proceeded to Abraham Inskips (in company with J.L. and wife) then to John Stokes’s, Isaac Borton’s, Jane Eves’s, Eliza. Lippincott, John Inskip’s, then to I. L. to lodge.
25. To William Whitin’s, Benjamin Matlack’s, Thomas Lippincott, Martin Durit’s, James Lippincott’s, Abigail Saxton’s.
26. To Samuel Burroughs, then to Cropwell Meeting which our elders say was to their satisfaction, then to William Vinicomb’s and William Davison which J.L. says wound up well. We have had fine weather, but now a storm of snow hail and rain and very cold.
27. To William Evans', Enoch Evans', and Isaac Andrews’s. This was the last within the compass of Cropwell Meeting. We lodged at Enoch Evans'.
28. I parted with our Friend Thomas Vickers. He went to Evesham and I came to Cropwell Meeting, which was a time of favor to me to good satisfaction in this visit to these families. The waters were so low at times and places we had hardly enough to float or navigate us but at some times pretty much favored with lively satisfactory opportunities to our satisfaction and the people I think generally expressed their satisfaction with the visit.
29. About home, hauling wood.
[Left marginal note] First Day
The 4th of last month there was a hard thundershower and a terrible hurricane which blew down George Githin’s chimney. It broke through the roof floor and all and narrowly missed of killing several of them, though but one was hurt. Last summer their shop was struck with the thunder and sat on fire. It was but about a year ago Ann Morton’s chimney blew down in a time of a hurricane broke, through the kitchen roof floor and all and narrowly missed killing her.
[Left marginal note] See Ezekiel 1:4, Behold a whirlwind cometh out of the North.
1790 27 of the Eighth Month. There was a most uncommon hard wind in Pennsylvania, a thunder show which made most ruinous work. I think the like I hardly ever heard of in our parts. Killed some creature, tore up orchards, blew down buildings, and blew some parts of buildings, as it was said, some miles.
<pb id="A0011521_062"/>
We have had a very exceeding great fruit year of all sorts of fruit, apples in particular. I never saw the like and I believe there never was so many at one season before. A general complaint for want of casks to hold cider. The apples kept very sound and hung on the trees full till very late and the ground covered with apples in some places till the snow came, which was 27th of the Eleventh Month 1790.
When I was at Christopher Smith’s, on our return from Salem Quarterly Meeting several Friends were telling of a great death amongst their apple trees. Several young orchards, they said, were almost all dead or likely to go with a kind of a worm of something at the roots. Some years ago the fruit, especially the apples, were blasted by one means or other in many places. The rose bugs eat up the young apples so that for many years together there was but very little fruit, not apples for house use, so that some said they that had no orchards were better of than them that had for they had none to cumber the ground. But now there is not casks to be had to hold the cider and abundance they get distilled, make molasses of it, let the creatures eat them and yet now in places abundance of choice sound apples under the snow. So we are tried both with plenty and with scarcity. O that we might learn like the apostle how to behave when we abound and otherwise.
We have had a pretty good season for grain and some here away have very good crops, but at Salem John Wister tells me they had a very dry summer especially the forepart and on places there about much complaint of the louse in the Indian corn. Some fields I heard of almost whole field being destroyed with the worms like pismires [?] and much complaint of the birds: crows and blackbird. With some of these thing one piece of ours was so hurt in the Spring that it was not more than half a crop.
Probably 30 of the Eleventh Month went to our meeting. John Simpson was there and I conceive the people believe he exceeds all. A most excellent time, some thought it was. I went to Joshua Lippincott’s with John Simpson and brother A. Wills. John Simson's subject in part was concerning the state of our society. Many goodly people, he said, dwell, as it were in a pleasant land like the land of Gilead and are like the people formerly not willing to pass over Jordan, but he said it is polluted and they that dwell in this easy state and pleasant land were nearer pollution than they were aware of and pressed the people to come a little further. He very much enlarged on this subject and spoke very beautiful to the school children in most endearing language.
{1790-12}
4. I was finishing a pump for John Robert 21 feet long.
5. Was First Day at or meeting. More deliberation still wanting. I hope to mend of that yet.
6. About home.
7. Was preparative meeting. But low times.
8. About home.
9. Went after some pine and I visited Cropwell school to pretty good satisfaction. A very cold freezing time.
10. Went to monthly meeting. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, December 1790: "The Clk. produced the Extracts from the Minutes of our Last Thearly Meeting which being read and considered, united the Meeting in the nomination of... John Collins, Henry Warrington, Joseph Warrington, John Hunt, John Maxell, Saml Burrough, William Wilkins, Enoch Evans, Simeon Haines, Joshua Owen, Joseph Wilcox and Joshua Stokes on the subject of Spiritous Liquors; and report their service there[sic</note> subjects to this Mtg at or before the Monthly meeting in the 8th  Month next, in order to enable it to send an account thereof to the ensuing Quarterly meetings as recommended."]  A very poor low time it was. There must be a cause. Search for the cause.
11. Was a very wet day. I was mending shoes etc.
12. Was First Day at our meeting. Came off but very poorly on examination. I had to remember Samson. He shook himself and thought to go out as at other times etc. 
<pb id="A0011521_063"/>
13th of the Twelfth Month, 1790. Killing hogs. Thomas Cowperthwaite’s wife was buried. 
14. I was at our meeting. A very low time, though not destitute quite of some life. R.R.
15. Salting up pork etc.
16. There came on a great storm of snow and very cold weather.
17. Jacob Haines’s wife was buried but we did not hear of in time to attend.
18. Very cold. I was hauling wood etc.
[Right marginal note] She died very suddenly.
19. Was First Day at our meeting which I thought was to profit. Came off pretty well I hope and believe. What a favor it is to be preserved above contempt. Several I observed looked very pleasant after meeting.
20. We were killing a beef and dressing it-- a bull-- in the afternoon. Samuel White and I went to see Joshua Evans who has been very ill but getting better. He tells me he has been much favored with quietude and resignation of mind and that the Lord owned his plain way and his singularities.
21. Went to our meeting but poor times, very cold snowy weather.
22 and 23. About home.
24. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Came off pretty well I hope.
25. Making a meat tub.
26. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. Amos Willis was there. A poor distressing time to me, the silent part the best. The rest of this week I was getting plow stuff. An exceeding cold snowy time.
{1791-01}
1 of the First Month 1791. A snowy cold day I was hauling logs to the saw mill for plow stuff.
2 of the First Month. Was First Day but poor low times.
2. About home.
3. Was our preparative meeting, something better than some.
4 and 5. Getting plow stuff. Very cold, snowy weather it has been, but now grow warmer. The snow taken away.
7. Was monthly meeting, Came off pretty well. More lively than last.
8. Was First Day. We went to Evesham with Lucas Gibbs from home here. The meeting was very low. After meeting my wife and I with Lucas Gibbs went to see three young men under dealings for the neglect of meetings. We labored to clear ourselves but they seemed deaf the entreaty and but one would sit with us. Their names were Sharp. A very rainy, freezing time. The ground all glazed with ice.
10. I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting which to me was but a low time, though perhaps to some profit and advantage. Here I met with our ancient Friend, Thomas Vickers with a view of accompanying him a few days. We went to Woodbury, lodged at S. Miccle’s.
11. Was at Woodbury Monthly Meeting. Things seemed very low. However, maybe some good was done. We went to Samuel Paul’s to lodge.
12. At Upper Grinage [Greenwich], which to me was a very low suffering time. D.C. says he believes it’s so to everybody that goes there. T.V. had a great deal to say, though the life and power I thought was wanting. This afternoon we had a meeting at Mullica Hill I think was a time of favor with a good degree of the savor of life. After this meeting I returned homeward eight miles after night as far as D. Cooper’s.
13. Got home and found all well. I thought to go to work but a call further out from home again.
14. I went to Cropwell Meeting at which was a marriage Samuel Lippincott and Ammer Haines. The meeting was low but ended something better.
<pb id="A0011521_064"/>
15th of the First Month 1790. I went to the burials of Agnes Lippincott. She died very suddenly, raving distracted, a young widow, daughter of John Inskip. There was a very large concourse of people. I had a pretty solid opportunity with them to some good satisfaction to myself and W.R., one of our elders, says it was so to him.
[Right marginal note] See back 13 of Ninth Month 1789 the account of the death of her husband.
16. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. A low time with me.
17. About home. At our meeting. low times. I was about home this week dressing out plow stuff. Cold weather. Nothing material this week except this: it was as to the inward state a cloudy time of contrary winds, a purging time.
23. Was First Day. At our meeting and I think favored again with a satisfactory time to myself and as I could discover it was so to my Friends.
24. At work at a pump for Isaac Peacok 37 feet long. John Collins and wife paid us a visit to my satisfaction in a good degree.
25. At our meeting Isaac Hutch was there and had acceptable service though the meeting was very low. There is many ways to gratify self etc. Extensive expressions. The rest of this week I was about I. Peacock’s pump alone. The boy goes to school.
30. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting and a good to me. [A] solid favored time it was I believe. After meeting I went to brother E. Evans' to dine and then went to see Jacob Evans who lies very ill. Then we went to visit John Inskip’s family, one of his sons being lamed with the kick of a horse.
31. Getting moldboard for plows.
{1791-02}
1 of the Second Month. At our meeting. A poor low meeting it was. After noon we put in Isaac Peacocks pump 36 feet 8 inches long. The rest of this week I was about home getting firewood and about plow work.
6. Was First Day. We were at our meeting. Came off middling well. After meeting we went to brother J. Warrington’s and to see John Stokes his family and had an opportunity to some satisfaction, though he was not at home (a poor intemperate creature striving to reform).
7. About home.
8. Was our preparative meeting and a good favored time it was to my satisfaction. I believe Friends were generally sensible that it was a better meeting than common.
9. At work in the shop. Very stormy weather as to the outward but no so inwardly though a little time past it was so.
10. My wife and I went to Evesham Preparative Meeting. The meeting, I thought, was middling. After meeting the Committee on Negro Cases met and had a lively conference on their business.
11. Was monthly meeting. <note resp="transcr">2 Month 1790: "The Women's Meeting inform'd that Judith Bispham (formerly Jennings) hath been treated with for outgoing in marriage, against which she had been precautioned, and that they have agreed to submit the same to this Meeting for further procedure therein, which after attention given, John Hunt and Josa Lippincott appear united in paying her a solid visit previous to our next Meeting and report their sense thereon, which is concurred with."</note>  Benjamin Reeve was there about to visit the Select members. I thought it was a pretty good lively meeting.
12. Hauling plow stuff from the sawmill.
13. Was First Day. I went to Vincent Town meeting. A small low meeting with hard labor. I thought I came off pretty well. No cause to repent going there. I called to see Elizabeth Collins who has been very ill but getting better.
14. Making a lye tub for Hinchman Bispham.
15. Went to our meeting, which was very low and poor till last it ended with a good degree of life and satisfaction to me and J.C. says so too.
16. Joseph and I went to make a pump for William Burr.
17. I went to Evesham meeting. Came off bravely. The Committee on Spirituous Liquors met. Conferred on that and other business. <note resp="transcr"> This Committee “on the subject of Spiritous Liquors,” to which Hunt was appointed, was formed by Evesham Monthly meeting held 12mo 1790 in accordance with the Extracts of the previous Yearly Meeting. The Committee was charged with “reporting their service to this Mtg at or before the Monthly meeting in the 8th Month next, in order to enable it to send an account thereof to the ensuing Quarterly Meetings as recommended (Minutes of Evesham Monthly meeting, 2mo 1790).</note>  
<pb id="A0011521_065"/>
18th of the Second Month, 1791. I went to the burial of Jacob Evans. A poor low dry time till just at last at the grave I had a satisfactory opportunity. It seemed as if my horse went the better for it and I did not mind the cold this afternoon. Afternoon I went and finished William Burr’s pump and he paid for it, 20 feet 4 inches long.
19. I came home through a great storm snow, hail and rain, and visited forepart of this week. It was so warm the frogs was singing, but by the middle of the week it was most extreme cold pressing violent windy weather. Some thought it exceeded all we have had this winter.
[Left marginal note] William Cox to good satisfaction
20. Was First Day. I was at our meeting but something is the matter. little or no satisfaction.
21. About home at work in the shop. At Joshua Burrows’s vendue afternoon.
22. At our meeting. Isaac Huch was there and did very well, but this meeting sat with me like physic on my stomach. The rest of this week about home at work in the shop. Very cold weather and stormy.
27. Was First Day we was at Evesham meeting. Old Thomas Wilkins was buried, aged 91 years as is said. There was a large concourse of people and I thought we came off pretty well, however W.R. signified he thought so. It was a strengthening healing time to me. This afternoon I set off to go to the burial of my aunt Mary Harvey. Went as far as William Rogers's and he sat of with me next morning.
28. Was a very hard rain like a shower in which we got very wet and the roads being extreme miry, through which with the rain and badness of the roads we concluded we could not get to the burial in season. So we went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting, which was small it being very stormy and bad roads. People were long a gathering which spoiled the first sitting very much, but in the afternoon we had a pretty lively time on the queries and other business William R. and I and Joseph H. lodged at Samuel Rogers's in Burlington.
{1791-03}
1 of the Third Month 1791 was their youth’s or general meeting which was large and much favored with a powerful living ministry, Mary Ridgeway and Jane Watson being there and favored in the exercise of their gifts. Mary was eminently raised with life and power.
[Right marginal note] We had a very lively time at parting the Select number.
Ezra Comfort and his companion Thomas Shoemaker was there and come with William Rogers this evening to perform an errand for our meeting to a young woman gone out in marriage. And I think we had a good favored time with the young people, then with the revive. And then called to see a relations of William R. and come off with satisfaction and finished the day’s work. Got back to our Friends to Joseph Buzby’s about 8 clock at night.
2. We were at Ancocas meeting which was very low the forepart, but growed better and ended very well and I believe to general satisfaction. I proposed in preparative meeting going into the women’s meeting and Ezra agreed to go with me and no cause to repent it. We dined at brother Aaron Wills’s. A large company. Aaron come with us to Mount Holly and there we parted with the Pennsylvania Friends and I got home and found all pretty well. About home at work in the shop the rest of the week.
6 of the Third Month. Was First Day. I went to see Samuel Allinson who lies very ill Benjamin Swet was there we had a little sitting with him and wife and than we went to Cropwell Meeting which to me was but lowish though not much cause of complaint
[Left marginal note sideways] At Burlington Quarter met May Ridgeway [who] told us there was a sore famine in the land and it required hard labor to get anything to live on etc. etc. etc.
<pb id="A0011521_066"/>
7th of the Third Month, 1791. Joseph and I went to make a pump for cousin Samuel Wills. A top piece 13 and a half [feet] long paid off all.
8. Finished the pump. Went to see William Buzby who lies very ill. He served his apprenticeship with me. Had some satisfaction.
9. We were at Ancocas meeting I thought I came off but poorly, but brother A: W: says come comparatively pretty well. Got home this evening. At work in the shop. 
11. Was monthly meeting. I thought it pretty well, though some matters, one in particular in which there was diversity of sentiments, in which there was something not pleasant nor exemplary. I went to see sister A. Evans who has been very poorly but getting better.
12. Was Select Meeting. Joshua Evans was with us and it was agreed that it was a time of favor so the clerk minuted and the meeting agreed to it though I thought there seemed a lowness yet there was many close searching and some lively remarks. Joshua Evan and Joseph Kaighn came here and lodged at the schoolhouse by J. Cowp and Friends agreed it was a time of favor in some good degree and no cause of discourage though the number of the Black people was but small, perhaps for want of their being properly notified.
14. At work in the shop.
15. Went to our meeting, which the number with whom I had something to do, I thought I discovered some were satisfied better than I was.
16. There was a large meeting appointed for Mary Ridgeway and Jane Watson from Ireland. Samuel Emlen, Thomas Scattergood, and Robert Willis were there. The women were highly favored. Mary especially was raised in great eminence, with good demonstration, life and power. The stream and main stress of their testimony was against a worldly spirit and a state of carnal security in own society. Scarcely a word to the drunkards and profligates. Likewise at Haddonfield, verse. they had very close tight scraping work. Jane said the people were so taken up with their worldly schemes and earthly concerns that it seemed as if they had forgotten they must die or that they had but a little time to stay here on earth. Mary began with this saying, We are ready to say sometimes, by whom shall Jacob arise for he is small <note resp="transcr">Amos 7</note>  and so went on in a lively powerful manner. Jacob, she said, was so little in his own eyes that he said he was a worm and no man and signified it was the case with some now a days. Now worms, she said, was a thing that was frequently trod upon* and some were so cruel in their nature that they delighted to tread upon them and would tread them to death. Thomas Scattergood had also very good service
[Left marginal note sideways] This doctrine concerning treading on worms made me think how Joshua Evans had been trampled upon amongst the people and oppressed at this place. Now see Sewel’s <italic>History</italic> page 657, William Dewsbury's words.
<pb id="A0011521_067"/>
After meeting I went to John Glovyer's and he went with me to settle some business with some Black people.
18 of the Third Month, 1791. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Ezra Comfort and his companion was there. The meeting was but small; it was thought one reason was the smallpox by inoculation was much in the neighborhood. Ezra was very poorly. I thought the meeting ended pretty well. The weather at this time was very warm like summer so that the people sweat and we could hardly set in the house without hoisting the windows.
19. I went with Ezra Comfort and his companion Thomas Shoemaker to Upper Evesham, but what shall I say of the meeting? Though there were many gospel truths delivered, the people seemed asleep. I thought it seemed as if the people had been taking sleepy drops, anodyne or Laudanum and it seemed as if there was no waking of them, though there seemed something of a solidity at last. This was a very stormy day. Rain in the morning and violent storm of snow in the afternoon through which these Friends rode down to Philadelphia homewards. A very great change of weather though it was so worm yesterday, the ground covered with snow the next day, clears up again still and fine.
20. Was First Day. Ezra was to have been at our meeting, but being unwell thought best to go homewards. The meeting was but a poor time far from being satisfactory to me. There must be a cause.
21. I was making a plow for Samuel Roberts.
22. At our meeting and a very poor low time it was though I had after meeting a satisfactory time with Mary Howe in company with our women overseers on account of her outgoing in marriage. Robert Howe shewed we his cancer on his breast and a dismal hole it has eat on the pit or upper part of his breast bone. The hole is as big as the palm of one’s hand or bigger.
23. I went to Hugh Cowperthwaite's to make a pump.
24. At work at the pump. Left the boys at it and I went to select meeting at Haddonfield. Mary Ridgeway and Jane Watson from Europe was there and had most excellent searching service amongst the elders in particular. After meeting I went and finished Hugh Cowperthwaite's pump, 18 feet 4 inches.
This night before we got home it was very dark and we met with some trouble. Run against another wagon and broke of one of the wheels and after that it was so dark we were much beset to find the way home. We were forced to leave the wagon and then on horse back. The boy got lost behind me. His horse got out in the swamp and a time of most dreadful thunder and lightning it was. After a time of blowing the horn and going out with the candle we got the lad home, but the dreadfulness of the thunder increased until midnight. It was really an humbling awful time to me. Very rare to see the like so early in the season.
[Right marginal note] See Sewel’s History, 357
I was informed that M. Ridgeway and J. Watson was very much affected with this time of thunder. It is said its not common to see the like in their land.
[Left marginal note sideways] 24. This night there was a house struck with the thunder, the bed singed where some children lay and not hurt, in the midst of the town of Mount Holly.
25. Was Quarterly Meeting at Haddonfield which I think was but lowish. The women Friends were quite shut up though there was several lively little testimonies delivered. I went down to town or to the river to Joseph Kains to lodge with William Rogers. Robert Willis was there and well in health.
26. We went to Select Meeting at Philadelphia and a most highly favored time it was. Mary Ridgeway and Mary Berry Had most excellent service. Mary Ridgeway's words was little children keep yourselves from idols and said she looked on herself to be one of those little children. And further she said a fear had possessed her mind least some there had been unhappily prevailed on to set up idols in their heart, in their mouths, and houses and mentioned the declension and that blindness in part had happened to Israel. Mary Berry was much on the same.
[Left marginal note sideways] I was told that at Upper Evesham Jane Watson told the people it was better to have an empty house than a bad tenant. I said the drunkard was a bad tenant and destroyed the house. The whoremonger also was a bad tenant etc.
<pb id="A0011521_068"/>
27. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting, which I believe was in some degree to general satisfaction. After meeting went to see Samuel Lippincott, very ill, like to die. See 14 of the Twelfth Month last. 
28. I went down to town with John Collins. Went to Select Meeting and very lively time and deeply instructing it was. Many lively sentences were dropped on the state of society.
Meeting of worship began at 10. I went to Pine Street meeting. John Simpson had edifying service on the subject of drunkenness: drunk but not with wine but with anger etc.
Peter Yarnall also was very notable and lively in Prayer. A good edifying meeting it was. Select Meeting at 3. Jacob Lindley had lively service, some of which was this: he said we should never be made perfect but by suffering. John Pemberton’s case concerning his going to England again was considered and referred. The meeting concluded and here I thought I seen some of the most beautiful creature in the world and that is innocent sweet spirited men and women: bright stars in the firmament of the Lord’s power, polished shafts in his quiver, as the prophet Isaiah expresses it.
29. I came up home on foot with William Rogers and John Collins at this last Select Meeting, though there were many bright shining examples, I had to look round and think of many that time past were such, but now seem to have got hitched by the way and wounded in their reputation and were not there. To wit, M.P., H.R., R.H., I. Ha: and A.H., J. Sa., J.R. and many others, which seemed to revive this caution: he that thinks he stands let him take heed least he fall. For it is so indeed we stand in slippery places, comparable to a sea of glass mingled with fire <note resp="transcr">Revelation 15:2</note> .
[Right marginal note] I am told that the thunder of the 24 struck a house in Mount Holly and singed a bed where some children lay, but did not hurt them.
30. About home.
31. Brother Robert was here.
{1791-04}
1 of the Fourth Month 1791. Brother Robert and I went up to see our relations at Springfield, uncle John Harvey’s and others and we had some temporal Interest to attend to.
2. We came home. 
3. Was First Day. It was a most distressing poor time. dullness, stupidity and insensibility prevailed. There seems no getting along with any thing at such times to any purpose.
	How dreadful is our state what dismal risks we run
	Must we be wicked if we are great and if we are poor undone. 
Almost all our money making men [illegible] are very drowsy and good for nothing at meeting.
4. At home.
5. Was preparative meeting. John Cox was there and had I thought a clear view of the state of the meeting.
6 and 7. At work at home.
8. Was monthly meeting. James Thornton was there and had most excellent lively edifying extensive service. I thought the meeting of business was not attended with that life as at some other times, though no cause of complaint. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, April 1791: "The Women's Meeting produced to this an Acknowledgment presented to theirs by Mary Haines for giving way to Temptation and thereby became the Mother of a Bastard child; requiring the assistance of this Meeting in further treatment with her: to which service John Hunt and John Collins are appointed and report their sense of her disposition of Mind to next Meeting."</note>

I was with him at Ancocas meeting and at our meeting and as he eyed to tell us so it is with him time will rub off after a while. We had some struggling of mind about going to our ancient worthy Friend Robert Willis his burial, but some things prevented, so we went to our meeting and had but a lowish time, though not the worst.
18. Joseph Buzby and wife was here. I was about a plow for G. Gilkins.
19. At our meeting, but so so sort of a time. Had an opportunity with I. [name indecipherable] who made request to be taken in amongst us.

23. I was at work at a plow for Noah Haines and went to the sawmill.

25. At work at a plow for S. Shute.

15. Was First Day. We were at Salem Meeting which was highly favored with a living ministry Huson Langstroth from Philadelphia, a young bright shining instrument lately raised up, was there and had a good service. In the afternoon at Salem the meeting was but low and almost silent. Lodged at Lucas Gibbs. Had an opportunity with the oldest children, the heads of the family: to advantage I hope.
16. Was Quarterly Meeting, which on the whole I believe was a pretty good edifying time especially in the meeting for business. Lodged at Heze Bates.
17. Was youth’s meeting, which to me was but a poor time though it might not be so with some others. We came up to John Jesups to lodge.
18. Got home and found all pretty well. About home the rest of this week.

{1791-06}
1st of the Sixth Month went to work at brother Samuel Stokes’s pump.
2. We finished it, 30 feet long, and I went with them to Haddonfield meeting and came off middling well I hope. Mary Swet took me by the hand as it were and united in labor which seemed comforting and strengthening. I came home this evening and here I found our much esteemed, well beloved, worthy, ancient Friend John Lloyd.
3. I went with John Lloyd as far as Enoch Evans. He was going to Egg Harbor Yearly Meeting and I was sorry I could not go with him. I went to work at Caleb Lippincott’s. Got to work at the pump log about 9: o Clock. Hewed it and bored it and dressed it off and had like to have finished it, 20 feet and a half long.
4. We went to the burial of Samuel Allinson. Daniel Offley, Nicholas Waln and John Parrish and divers others were there, but it was a poor low shut up time. But I find since J.C. and some others did not think so. I had something to do.
5th of the Sixth Month. Was First Day<italic>. Miscellanies Moral and Instructive,</italic> page 138: <note resp="transcr">Milcah Martha Moore, Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in prose and verse. London: J. Phillips, 1787.</note>  it is said it was the practice of Vespastian the Roman Emperor to call himself to an account every night for the actions of the past day, and as often as he let slip one day without doing some good he entered upon his diary this memorial "I have lost a day
	Count that day whose low descending sun,
	Views from thy hand no worthy action done.
I went to Cropwell Meeting and a good favored time I think it was to me and went to see S. Allinson’s family. 
<pb id="A0011521_071"/>
6 of the Sixth Month 1791. I went to make a pump for Amos Haines and Left the boy to finish it, 15 feet long all settled.

14. At our meeting. There was two couples married, Joshua Lord and William Evans. On the whole at last I had good satisfaction.
15. Making a plow for Samuel Allinson's widow, then About home tending corn etc. till 18 I went to mend a pump for E. French.
19. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. John Cox, Jr., was there and think spoke very prettily, came off middling well. We went to brother I. Warrington’svto dine and this afternoon at our meeting. John Reeve and Benjamin Reeve had a meeting at our meeting house which was middling as to life.
20. John and Benjamin Reeve on a religious visit to the select members of our quarter had a sitting in our family in which much pertinent council was communicated. I then went with them to Joshua Roberts, Ha Cowpert, Robert French’s and brother Joseph Warrington’s, then to John Collins to lodge. Here I left these Friends and came home.
21. Was at our meeting. I having been out late several nights past lost some sleep and took some cold. Had a numb pain in my head and a most distressed poor dull meeting we had. 
Whilst I was in company with John and B. Reeves they informed me that there were two men and two women drownded just before. They left home on the strand or beach or water shoals in a party of pleasuring, like them at Rahway a few years back. Walked out [illegible] that in kind of bravado got out of their depth got frightened. The women clinged fast to the men and all drowned together, some of them having children grown up and married.
Another thing John Reeve told me I thought worth notice concerning a man, one of his neighbors, much given to strong drink and exceeding abusive to his wife when drunk so that she seemed often in great danger of her life and frequently came to their house when he turned her out, who was much surprised by two men, as he thought, who came to him dressed in white and opened a prospect to him what would assuredly be his doom if he held on in his wicked course, which so surprised him that he betook himself to performing religious duties in the way of the Baptists and so continued very temperate and religious for two years and then broke out to drinking again. John said he thought he was one of the most profane men in language before, but after his taking to it the second time, if it was possible, he was ten times worse than before but lived not long after. Died in his bed. Nobody knew how his wife found him a corpse.
22. About tending corn etc.

<pb id="A0011521_072"/>
About hay and harvest work.
[Right marginal note] Under considerable affliction with a bad bite
{1791-07}

4. About reaping.
5. At our preparative meeting, a lowish time.
6 and 7. Finished reaping.
8. Was monthly meeting. Elizabeth Collins had good service in the first sitting and the business was pretty well conducted. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, July 1791. "They [the Women's Meeting</note> inform that they have treated with Mary Hillman (formerly Evans) for outgoing in Marriage, and are united in submitting her case to this for further procedure therein, which after being deliberated upon united friends in deferring the same to next Meeting, under the care of William Rogers, and John Hunt; who are desired to take a solid opportunity with her, and report their sense of her disposition of Mind thereat."] 
9. Getting in grain and hay etc.
10. Was First Day I went to Cropwell Meeting which was satisfactory and went to the Negro meeting this afternoon which I think was not to be complained of. Elizabeth Collins had good service amongst them this day. Elizabeth Bud, daughter of Benjamin Cooper, was buried, who died with a cancer in her breast.
11. About mowing. This day William Tallman was tried for his life at Woodbury and condemned to be hang for robbery.
12. At our meeting which was not a satisfactory time to me somehow.
13. About mowing.
14. I went to Evesham Meeting and came off with satisfaction after meeting. The Committee on Spirituous Liquors met to consider that matters.
15 and 16. About. Hay and hauling in grains etc.
17. Was First Day. I went to Woodbury meeting, which was a low shut up time with me. This afternoon I went to see William Tallman, a young man about 21 years of age under sentence of death for stealing. John Tatham went with me into the prison and had a good deal to say to him and he seemed affected and tenderhearted after we had been speaking to him.
[Right marginal note] He was executed the Seventh Day following.
18. Joshua Burroughs sent for me to come and see him under great affliction with an ulcer and not like to continue many days. He seemed under very great concern about his future state and greatly desirous of a full assurance of his peace being made. I believe I left him more easy in mind.
19. Went to our meeting, which to me was somewhat satisfactory.
20 and 21. About hay.
22. We went to the burial of Joshua Burroughs. Rebekah Wright was there. We had a meeting after the burial and a solid profitable time I believe it was. It ended I thought solid savory and well. I had good satisfaction. Rebekah Wright had good service.
This young man told me the other day when I was with him that he had been greatly troubled about giving way to much to fashionable dress and said if he got well again there should never be a coat with cross pockets come on his back and said he did not want to live longer, only to set his house in order etc. He had the fall-down collar and unnecessary capes taken off before.
23. About home hauling wood etc.
24. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting and came off pretty middling well, I am in hopes. After meeting brother Enoch Evans and I visited three families, one on account of selling strong drink and the others respecting the use of it in time of harvest and they all three expressed hearty satisfaction with our visit and particularly their wives.
25. We went to Cropwell Meeting appointed for Zachariah Ferris from Willmington, who had good service and a good solid profitable meeting I think it was and ended with life and savor. Zacheriah and his two companions, Robert Johnson and William Canby came home with us after having a sitting to profit, I hope, at William Siniamly.
<pb id="A0011521_073"/>
26 of the Seventh Month, 1791. Went to our meeting. Zachariah Faris had very excellent service and was favored in Supplication at last. I went with these Friends to Joshua Bispham's to dine and then we went to William Rogers's to lodge.
27th. We were at Upper Evesham and came off bravely, I believe, though great stupidity prevailed amongst a many professors. We lodged at William Snowden's.
28. We came to Lower Evesham. A full crowded meeting it was and a lively time, especially towards the latter part. It ended with solidity and with a good degree of the savor of life. Here I left these Friends with feeling nearness and uniting regard. This morning before meeting we had an opportunity in two families, T.B. and N. Leeds, to a good degree of satisfaction. It seemed as if I could have went through the world with these Friends.
29 and 30. About home making a plow for Thomas Stokes and at work on the place.
31 of the Seventh Month 1791. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting and it was a good satisfactory meeting to divers of us. William R. says it was to him. At this meeting notice was given of the burial of John Stokes. William Rogers and I went to the burial and a poor shut up time it was. He was killed with a fall from a horse. As he was running of him, the horse threw him against a gate post near against our meeting house door. Broke his skull and killed him instantly. Much in drink, he was perhaps one of the greatest drunkards of his age and one of the most profane with his tongue that was ever raised in these part, though a wealthy Friends son of a reputable family. I think I never saw more hard heartedness, unfeeling, unsympathsing, insensibility prevail at a burial in my life. If the Scriptures had told us that all that die drunk and all the drunkards should Surely go to heaven it would not be so admirable.
When William Tallman, a young man about 21 years of age, was hanged the other day at Woodbury for robbery, I was informed it was a serious, solemn time and many were affected with tenderness, even to tears but no such thing here. And here the retailers of strong drink could come to the burial as unconcerned as the rest. O! how custom has blinded our eyes and drawn a veil or brought a thick cloud over us. 
William Rogers informs me that a young man from Maryland brings straight and clear intelligence that at Maryland they have had no rain for three months and so pinched with the drought that they are forced to feed their creatures with corn to keep them from starving to death.
{1791-08}
1 of the Eighth Month 1791. About home at work on the place hauling rails wood.
2. Went with Joshua Evans (who was here, lodged with us) to our preparative [meeting]. The first for worship, I think, was pretty well but the business went on dull, though Joshua and I went in amongst the women and had a lively favored scraping time, tending to the increase of strength.
3. I visited Mary Hilman and her husband on account of their outgoing in marriage and came off with satisfaction to myself and to them, as they divers times expressed. <note resp="transcr">Hunt and William Rogers were appointed by Evesham Monthly meeting held 7mo 1791 “to take a solid opportunity” with Hillman “for outgoing in Marriage” (Minutes of Evesham Monthly meeting, 7mo 1791).</note>  I also got a tree home for E. Hollinshead's pump.
4. I went in company with William Rogers to Mount Holly Monthly Meeting. There was William Shatterthwaite and Isaac Hutah and I think we had some lively close work especially in answering queries and yet I think cause why it was so. Great weakness prevails there, a taking up a rest and dwelling on the surface of things and content with the form and not willing to alter or be roused up. I lodged at William Rogers's.
5. Went to our monthly meeting. Met a Committee on Spirituous Liquors to agree on a report, which we did to mutual satisfaction and strengthening comfort.*
[Left marginal note sideways] But we had but a dull time in meeting for business, though there was something quieting at the close of the first sitting and I had satisfactory time amongst the women.
6. I put in a bottom piece in Ellenor Hollinshead’s pump, 25 feet 6 [inches] long. Preached to others etc. A thorn in the flesh etc.
<pb id="A0011521_074"/>

Jacob Evans buried his wife and one child with the flux which seems spreading. Thomas Potter at Haddonfield buried his wife last week. A young Couple went to our meeting. Solomon Gaskill was there and had good service and I thought we had a very good meeting strengthening comforting and healing to me after a wounding time.
[Right marginal note] Joseph Butcher died with a small cut in his leg mortified. Had a young son.
8. I made a plow for William Rogers.
9. Went to our meeting and a most distressing poor dull time it was. A lethargic drowse seemed to cover all. I mended two pumps afternoon, one for Samuel Hackney and one for I. Wortington.
10. I went to mend James Lippincott’s pump and found it quite rotten.
11. I went to mend some pumps for Nehemiah Leeds, all settled.
12. I went to work at a top piece for James Lippincott’s pump, 18 feet 6 inches long and went to Cropwell Meeting. James Thorington was there and Solomon Gaskill and abundance of preaching we had and I think it was a solid good meeting.
13. We finished James Lippincott’s pump.
14. Was First Day at our meeting and came off pretty well, I hope, though not so well but it might have been much better.
15. At work at a cheese press for John Evans. William Rogers and his wife was here.
16. At our meeting a most shocking poor dull time it was I believe to almost all, but Rebekah Roberts seemed to have some life about her.

19. Went to work at a pump for Joseph Gardiner.

22. Met at John Collins'. John Collins', Enoch Evans, and Joshua Owin and I went to visit the retailers of spirituous liquors in Moorestown. Had an opportunity with John Cox and wife to clear ourselves but they are settled on their lees and blinded through dark and wicked customs. Had an opportunity with the widow Wood endeavoring to persuade them to be careful not to sell strong drink to them that have no government of themselves and of the bad effects of such practices. R. Smith was not at home, but we had a full opportunity with the magistrate, Reece Edwards, to no satisfaction except clearing ourselves.
23. Was at our meeting. The forepart I thought was a favored time in silence, but it did not end to my satisfaction, though perhaps to my instruction and profit, something like a dose of physic. Remember John Churchman, aye and divers others: Bownas, Maplebeck.
24. I went after a load of bricks and mended Joshua Lippincott’s pump.
25. Made a plow for Samuel Davis.
26. Went to make a pump for Edmund Hollinshead.
27. Finished E. Hollinshead’s pump, 25 feet, 10 inches long.
28. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and a time of favor I think it was. I.C. after meeting said, Well, John thee has mended thy misses. I went home with brother Joseph Warrington.
29. We went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting. Huson Langstroth had good service and in the afternoon on business we had a favored time, came off bravely. Went to brother Aaron Wills’s to lodge. I went to see Hannah Stokes, a young woman lays very ill of a fever.

5. I went to John Rudrow’s to lash timber for two pumps and got it home.
6. Was our preparative meeting. About our queries, my Friends and me cannot agree. We had a fighting time. Some seem to pass along smooth and fine as if all was well.
7:8. I was at work at two pumps, one for Joshua, others done for John Rudrow’s and put in a pump for Nathan Haines 23 [feet] 6 [inches]. The bottom pieces was an old one 16 feet long.
9. Went to monthly meeting which was a time of close labor and rough work for me, but rather gained ground. I have heard tell of state's attorney and king’s attorney etc. and of old Benjamin Lay. I think come off pretty well on the whole but it might have been better.
10. Went to Select Meeting which was a time of close rough labor to me. I made greatest part of a plow for Joshua Bispham and sent Ostler’s and Rudrow’s pumps home, each near 17 feet long, all settled but N. Haines.
11. Was First Day. I was at home, our son Samuel having been about a week past very ill of a fever and purging and sickness at stomach and having been broke of my rest. A very great rain today and having a bad boil I attended no meeting today. There was another Negro meeting this afternoon.
12. About home making a plow for [Crossed out] Joseph Coles. 
14. I went to Woodbury Monthly Meeting, but Samme being so ill I did not get there till very late this afternoon. I mended John Tatham’s pump and I went to John Jesup’s on some urgent business.
15. Came home.
16 and 17. I was very poorly afflicted with a boil and fever.
18. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and think there was a good degree of quiet and orderly stillness over the meeting and I hope it ended pretty well. This afternoon Joshua Evans came here and lodged.
19. We went to the burial of Thomas Dudley’s daughter about 18 years. We had a sitting after the burial and a good deal was said, but it seemed to be a hard laborious time and the life wanting. Many there who seldom ever get to meeting, settled on their Lees.
20. I went after a log for a pump instead of going to meeting.
21. I went to Joseph Warrington’s to work at a pump to little purpose for it seemed as if wind and tide was against us.
22. I went to Select Meeting at Haddonfield. Robert Nesbet and his companion John Luptun from New England-- Robert had most exceeding close searching service and I think it was a pretty smart, searching, lively good meeting. This evening Isaac Coates and William Fisher from Pennsylvania came to see one and Job Collins and his wife all lodged with us and next morning had a sitting with Samme who lies very ill of the fever. The company of these Friends was truly sweet and satisfactory.
23. We went to our Quarterly Meeting. Robert Nesbet from New England had most excellent close home searching service and in the meeting for business we had a very favored time. The bells seemed to ring clear with good favor (the bell and the pomegranate together) <note resp="transcr">Exodus 28:34, 39:26</note> . I think it was the most favored time to me that I ever had at that meeting. A smart searching time.
24. I could not get to select meeting at town as usual. Finished Jacob Hay’s pump, 21 [feet] long.
[Left marginal note sideways] Robert Nesbet seemed very bold in his business and told us of a case of a young man in the time of the wars whom the soldier met with and told him he must go with them. No, said he, I am a Quaker, I can’t fight. You a Quaker! said they. Yes, said he, I have a right. But, said they, you have not got the marks. So they took and cut off his hair for he had it tied. They cut off his cross pockets and some buttons.
<pb id="A0011521_076"/>
[Left marginal note] Samme lies yet very ill.
25 of the Ninth Month 1791. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and thought there was a very commendable quiet and stillness and I hope it ended pretty well. Hudson Middleton from Virginia after meeting informed me that, what with the drought and the war their grass was cut off, so that where they used to mow five hundred load of hay they would not this season now mow five load, and that R. Haines who used to mow a great deal would not mow or had not mowed a handful. And that they were driving their cattle this way to sell and had to go fifteen miles for water in places. And from some Friends from the eastward, they say that in some parts there is hundreds of acres of corn that will not produce the seed that planted it. Another account says that there is thousands of acres that will not produce five bushels to the acre. That it is not higher than a man’s waistband. Surely these accounts are enough to make people look round them and consider what they have been doing with the Lord’s outward blessing in times of plenty and even we here by this time should have been in a most languishing condition before now, if the pinching drought had continued till this time. But now there is abundance of choice pasture and we seem to have forgotten the threatening prospect that appeared a few weeks ago. 
Brother Joshua Hunt was here from Redstone.
26. I went down to the Yearly Meeting with him. Meeting of Business began at the 10 hour and opened in a solid manner. Proceeded to read the accounts brought up in the queries of the state of the meetings. At the close of this sitting I had one right fair shot to very good satisfaction. After meeting I met with Samuel Emlen and he told me he was glad to hear my voice lifted up amongst them. I told him I hardly expected I could attend any more on account of my son’s being so ill at home. He said, I believe thee came to do what thee did and further said, whatsoever thine hand finds to do, do it with all thy might.
I stayed the next sitting this afternoon which was to my satisfaction. We had some right down sharp shooting, perhaps pursuant to the command shoot at Babylon spare no arrows <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 50: 14</note> . Robert Nesbit from New England was the archer and the subject was concerning a conformity to the world and uniformity amongst ourselves, especially active members, concerning which a deficiency and want appeared in that great meeting which was looked upon to be the greatest on the continent and therefore much looked up to. For example, a certain something was closely spoken to which had been an exercise for some years past to many well concerned Friends and that was the assistant clerk who had been clerk wore cross pockets and very high collared clothes. We had a close searching time but it all settled a way quietly and the meeting went on orderly and solid, by so it is to be hoped all of it will work together for good. 
I came home and found my poor son growing worse as to the disorder but in a very tender favored frame of mind. He expressed divers very affecting edifying exhortations and tender cautions and advice to his little sisters. He called them to him took them by the hand told them not to set their minds on fine things and said there was a great Lord who loved good children and loved to do them good, but them that set their minds on fine things the Lord did not love so well, for they mostly did bad things and said the Lord behold the proud afar off and he told them there was a good country where good people went to when they died, where they should have no more sorrow nor trouble and spoke something to them of the bad country and asked them if they thought (it was a very tendering time) they would remember what he said. One of them answered yes and said she never thought it was right. 
The fever continued very violent which caused him to be lightheaded, unsensible at times but at this time I believe he was very sensible and asked me if I thought it was possible for such a one as he to be made fit for that glorious place concerning which it was said no unclean thing can enter. I told him I had no doubt of it, and that he had for the most part done pretty well and that I hoped he would be accepted. He said they were close sayings, where no unclean thing can enter and then expressed a desire that he might have a full clear evidence of his peace being made. 
And then he wanted to know of me how the Yearly Meeting went or how we fared. He said perhaps not so favored as at some other times. I told him it opened solid and well and business went on well as long as I stayed. I had good satisfaction. He said he was glad to hear it and said he that it was a pity I should be hindered from the Yearly Meeting (of this he had always appeared very tender) and that he was sorry to keep me from the meeting. I signified to him I was resigned. 
<pb id="A0011521_077"/>
His disorder, the fever, seemed to return with greater violence (notwithstanding all that the doctor or we could do) which deprived him much of his senses yet he was sensible in part. At times would call his Friends and neighbors by their names that came to see him and showed very loving and affectionate to all of us. Once he said to me, Oh Father, * How I love thee. I love thee. I think I love thee.
[Left marginal note] *his arms around my neck
His uncle Aaron Wills came to see him, but his fever was so violent he could not converse much. But yet he did ask his uncle if he thought they should ever see one another again in this world. His uncle told him he could not tell, but said he was in hopes it would be for the best if they did not. 
His fever still seemed to rage and weaken him very fast yet I it appeared he had some right sense and knowledge of things till near the last moments: he would take drink etc. He appeared to be exceedingly afflicted and in great distress both of body and mind, till the 30 of the Ninth Month about 5 o’clock in the morning he departed this life and I hope suffered his last. 1791.
The day after our Quarterly Meeting William Allinson and two other young men, strangers, came to see him and he spoke to them in a very tendering affecting manner. He told William Allinson that he had thought he felt great nearness to him of late, that they had been engaged to walk together in one path or one way and desired he might persevere, with something more to that effect which seemed to have a very tendering reach on the young men. He told his mother afterwards he believed it was a favored time with them. He had during his illness several opportunities with his little brothers and sisters advising them to be good boys and said to Benjamin, be a good boy and then there is nothing will hurt the hardly. Which advice was dropped in such a manner that it made very tendering impressions. Whilst I was at town he expressed himself after this manner, which was expression such a manner that his mother desired a neighbor to write it down, viz: Oh Lord, be pleased to strengthen me that I may appear before thee, with something more which she could not well recollect clearly.
He one day asked the doctor what he thought of him, who seemed not hasty in answering. He told the doctor he need not be afraid to speak for he had been favored not to be alarmed, and said divers times he thought he was pretty much resigned but said his fever was so hard he had not or could not think much about it. I remember in the forepart of his sickness there was some conversation passed in the room respecting great and high letter learned ministers he said the Lord is certainly able to raise up ministers without it.
He in the time of his illness told his little brothers that he had endeavored to set them a good example but had missed it sometimes and then had to suffer for it. As I was one day holding back in his chair whilst his bed was making, I was saying something about his having a great deal of sickness and that may be it might be for the best and work together for good he answered he had no doubt of it and said there seemed not room for a single wish. This was after I had been mentioning the affliction of Lazarus who was full of sores: and so it seemed to be with him. The doctor had laid blister plasters on him for the fever and then there came boils very bad boils near where the blisters were drawn so that he was sorely afflicted and yet bore it with great patience and said both in this and his last sickness that he had no doubt but it was all in best wisdom. So was not heard to murmur or complain. He was born [blank space left in manuscript for birthday never filled in]
He has been a steady youth, a near dear dutiful and affectionate child to me, of great comfort and help in my temporal affairs in taking care of my business when I was from home and tending markets for me and buying necessaries for the family, and likewise in religious matters he strengthened my hands. We often had religious conversation together when alone and on passages of Scripture in which he had a strong and clear memory, never much at a loss to find almost any passage we conversed on. I thought his judgment was beyond his years in his younger days, and his stability and steadiness superior to most of his contemporaries.
<pb id="A0011521_078"/>
He has preserved a good name and I believe in good esteem among not only his intimate friends and near relations but wherever he was known, so I hope there is little or no room to doubt but that our loss is his gain and that he now rests with the righteous where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest where none of the inhabitants ever shall say I am sick, as it is mentioned by the prophet.
{1791-10}
2d of the Tenth Month. Was First Day. The people met here at the 9th hour to the burial of our dear son Samuel. James Thornton came here with divers of our relations on Seventh Day night up from the Yearly Meeting went with us to the burial. A very large concourse of people there was and James Thornton had most excellent service and especially amongst the youth and divers times made mention of our dear son, of his steady example and innocent circumspect pious life and said without any reserve or exceptions but positively, he is now safe out of the enemy’s reach where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. 
I do think he was highly favored and that it was a very solid affecting time to many. Thomas Scattergood and Abraham Griffen was there but was silent. Thomas Scattergood came home with us with a considerable number of our relations. 
After dinner we had a sitting and Thomas Scattergood had most excellent service and especially amongst the youth, a number of which were present and he likewise divers times made mention of our dear deceased son Samme and of his great troubles and afflictions he had passed through and mentioned that passage of Scripture in the Revelations of St. John the Divine, the question what or who are these; these are they that have come through great tribulation etc. <note resp="transcr">Revelations 7:14</note>  and said as J.T. had said, and alluded to his words in the meeting, and concurred with his testimony and said without reserve positively to this effect that he was gone out of the reach of trouble and centered in a state of endless bliss and happiness. 
He told us of the weakness that had attended him ever since he had left his home and said he had not one syllable to say in the meeting. But, says he, this is my meeting and now I know what I came for, and a highly favored tendering time it was.

There was something very calming, soon covered and I think it was a lively edifying meeting and though some miss might happen, on review I had sweet peace and good satisfaction. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, October 1791. "Our beloved Friend Elizabeth Collins opened to this Meeting a concern that hath for some time attended her Mind to pay a religious visit to some Meetings of Friends within the compass of Shrewsbury and Rahoway Quarterly Meeting with other meetings adjacent, as Truth may open her way; requesting our sympathy and united concurrence therein, which was obtained. Our Friend Rebecca Cowperthwaite also informed us of her willingness to accompany said friend in her proposed visit with which the Meeting expressed their full concurrence—the former being a Minister, and the latter an Elder, in good esteem with us.

11. Was First Day. W. was at our meeting and a highly favored time it was to me, tending very perceivably to the increase of unity, love, life and strength, one of the most open times I ever had.
12. I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting, met the others of the Quarters Committee on spirituous liquors, appointed to labor to discourage the Traffic therein and unnecessary use thereof. I thought there seemed a lowness and want of life yet ability was given to labor and things were laid close home in an extensive manner, so no cause of complaint or discouragement.
13. At our meeting and came off brave. Had the countenance of my Friends perceivably. What ups and downs! I have see Joseph White’s <italic>Affectionate Address</italic> in manuscript, page 34:
	For may it not without reserve be named,
	confirm’d apostates never were reclaimed
	Or have we heard or did we ever know	
	A bold apostate solid Christian grow
	Yet in our pilgrimage we often find
	Both times of ebbing and flowings in the mind
	And from a want of steady watchful care
	Receive a wound from Satan’s poisoned spear
	And yet not lost but be again restored
	And reconciled through grace to their offered Lord, etc. 
	So it is and so best.
14 and 15. About dressing out plow stuff etc.
16. Went to Cropwell Meeting. Had an open satisfactory time.

19th of the Third Month 1792. My wife and I attend a meeting or conference at Evesham appointed for parents and heads of families wherein some minutes of our Yearly Meeting respecting the care and education of the youth was read. Thomas Scattergood and Joshua Evans was with us and a highly favored time it was. The testimony was raised into dominion over all against divers undue liberties but most particularly against the custom of company keeping among the youth. The meeting was well conducted and ended in a very savory solid manner.
20. At our meeting Enoch Roberts and Hannah Shute were married. Thomas Scattergood was there and had most excellent extensive service very particular to the worldly minded. I omitted or put of opening the door till he got in and opened it in the very way and the words I had opened to me.

22. Went to Select Meeting at Haddonfield. Thomas Scattergood was there and had excellent service. The last sitting for business things to me seemed low got along middling so so.
23. Was Quarterly Meeting. Mary Newbold spoke first most sweetly and Thomas Scattergood took up the greatest part of the meeting, very long and very notable. The stream of his testimony was chiefly towards the youth. He mentioned the sorrowful instance of the young people that were drowned at Rahway just after being solemnly warned at such a meeting as this. Went out in a party of pleasuring and seven were drownded. One of them beside what he heard at meeting was remarkably warned in a dream, yet would venture to go and was drownded. Four were taken up and buried together. the others three it was thought were eaten by the sharks. In the meeting for business I had good satisfaction. When meeting broke up Thomas Scattergood said to me, thou mayst be encouraged. So came home with an answer of peace.
24. Was Select Meeting at town but sickness in the family prevented my attending. At work in the shop plow making.
25. Was First Day. At our meeting. Came off pretty well I believe.

{1792-04}

He gave way to despair and refused to eat and so died like John Hollinshead in a sorrowful manner.

2. About plow making.
3. Was our preparative meeting which was pretty well. Some matters lively.

29. Was First Day. I got down to a little meeting in Penns Neck which was to some satisfaction; then to Salem Select Meeting Second Day which was their monthly meeting at which the Quarter’s Committee on Spirituous Liquors had agreed [to] meet and did meet and I think it was a lively favored time. 
We, that is Joshua Evans, John Tatham, Thomas Redman, myself and James Cooper proceeded to Greenwich Monthly Meeting. Was at their Select Meeting and monthly meeting which was a time of openness for labor. We visited all the retailers of spirituous liquors in that village, and although they seemed to cling to the profits of selling rum etc. and though there seemed but little entrance to be made in the hearts of some yet we all agreed the labor was manifestly owned and the testimony raised in meetings as well as in some families. Parted with Friends with increasing feeling nearness and uniting regard. 
John Tatham and I had some lively opportunities in several families over the creek and with Thomas Williams (and family) who was a servant to my father when I was a child, and at John Lanins who was an old playmate when we were boys, and at Samuel Reeves after this we had a solid opportunity with all the retailers in the town together which was to good satisfaction. Then came up to Piles Grove. Had an opportunity with a retailer there, then with another one at the Head of Timbercreek. Then I returned home and had peace of mind. 
{1792-05}

11. Was monthly meeting which was on the whole pretty well.
12. Went to Select Meeting, a time to be remembered: and not with pleasantness. Such a time as we never had before, and hope to never have no more though it may work together for good and tend to profit. The apostle recommended an earnest contending for the faith, but then it should be in [illegible] right spirit great [he]ights end in [gr]eat D[epths] [illegible]. 
<pb id="A0011522_003"/>
At our last Spring meeting I borrowed off John Pemberton <italic>Primitive Christianity</italic> written by William Cave. <note resp="transcr">William Cave, Primitive Christianity: or the Religion of the Ancient Christians...in three parts. London: printed for J. Walthoe et. al., 1728.</note>  Read it through in about two weeks and since a very excellent piece called the art of contentment, in both of which are many things very deeply instructing.
13 of the Fifth Month. Was First Day. In the writings of Christopher Love, said to be one of the martyrs, page 103, speaking of the body. Here in this world your bodies are liable to many sufferings and many sorrows and dissipations – in heaven you shall bid sorrow and sighing fly away hence. Here, as the philosopher terms it, your bodies are but like an hospital wherein all are full of infirmities, all the members of the body are subject to passion and weakness, but in heaven they shall not be so. Here the body is a magazine of all kinds of diseases. Pliny tells us that in his time, the body was subject to three hundred several kinds of diseases, but now I say three times more. Many thousand infirmities the body in this world is subject to. See the prophet's words, None of the inhabitants ever shall says I am sick. Here our bodies tend to corruption, meat for worms, and thence proceeds loathsome savor. Eliphaz in Job calls it a house of clay, Paul a house of earth, the philosophers a moldering cottage. Ecclesiastes 12:7: Dust shall turn to earth, as it was subject evil and noisome diseases, a sink, dung a magazine of all infirmities. Here our bodies lumpish and heavy, here we are like tired jades that go on slowly in all divine employments, must be spurred on to all good duties etc. mention a possibility of being made more swift than the chariots [of] Amminadib <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 6:12</note>  in all the ways of God at our meeting and do believe it was a good meeting strengthening and satisfactory.
14. About planting.

About some plows etc.

Upon a Quiet Conscience
Close thine eyes and sleep secure,
Thy soul is safe, thy body sure,
He that guards them, he that keeps,
Never slumbers, never sleeps,
At quiet conscience is the best
Has only peace, has only rest
The music and the mirth of kings,

Then close thine eyes in peace and sleep secure,
No sleep so sweet as thine, no rest as sure.

[Note: John Hunt's Journal gives the following passage, which does not correspond to the manuscript:"7th Month. This season, many harvest fields have been cut off by the Hessian fly, as they are called. Some fields of wheat, in divers places, have been blasted with a kind of mildew; yet on the whole there was a plentiful harvest, and a fine time to get it in. But some were reaping on the first-day; in which I thought I saw the danger of looking at the gifts, and forgetting the Giver; like the man we read of, whose ground brought forth plentifully, so that he concluded he would pull down his barns and build larger ones, that he might have room to bestow his fruits and his goods. But let it be remembered what was said to him, "Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall be those things be which thou hast provided. So shall it be with all those who lay up treasure for themselves, and are not rich toward God." There is danger of giving earthly treasures the preference, and so living far from the state of one formerly, who said, "Let my right hand forget her cunning, if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chiefest joy." If we give anything the preference, we render ourselves unworthy of the Divine favor.
"If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off or thy right eye, pluck it out." There have been many people under different denominations, who have chosen rather to part with the greatest outward comforts of this life, things that might be compared to a right hand, or right eye, rather than give anything the preference to the Truth; or comply with things which they believed were contrary to the Divine will; and many have not only given themselves up to suffer the most cruel tortures, but have even laid down their lives, rather than comply with what they thought was wrong. O'Leary, on Toleration, says, "Persecution, on the score of conscience, has thinned the world of fifty millions of human beings." (264-265)]

On a quiet conscience

Thy soul is safe thy body sure
He that guards them he that keeps
Never slumbers never sleeps
A quiet conscience in the breast

And Nathan Yarnall, also an approved minister, and Nathan Smith and Emmer Kimber and Enoch Walker, all large acceptable ministers, lost their seats in the gallery through insolvency and Sarah Cressen, a beautiful minister, sunk under lowness of mind. What scenes of sorrows and calls for humility and fear and watchfulness.
Brother Aaron Wills came here and he and his daughter Grace went with me to Philadelphia evening meeting, which ended solidly. Peter Yarnall, David Sands and several others had weighty service. I attended the several sittings of this meeting both select and others, which was a time of great edification and comfort. divers yea many sentences of these worthies were dropped on various subjects with such demonstration clearness life and power that I thought they not only deserved a place in our minds, but it was a query with me whither they did not deserve to be transmitted to the latest generations. I had some satisfactory opportunities in families where my lot was cast. meeting concluded on Seventh Day About 2 o’clock

And inasmuch as divers other matters of importance are contained in said Extracts which may necessarily claim the attention of the Meeting, it appeared the solid sense thereof that the following named friends with the Overseers be appointed to unite in the weighty consideration thereof, and report their sense thereon to the Meeting on the 9th  Month next John Hunt, John Collins, Reuben Matlack, Saml Lippincott, John Roberts, Morgan Hollinshead, William Roberts, Joshua Lippincott, William Rogers, William Snowdon, William Haines, John Haines Junr, Job Collins, William Troth, Barzillai Braddock, Ephriam Stratton, William Branin, who agree to meet at this place next second day in the first month at the eleventh Hour."</note>  Joshua Evans was there.

My wife and I went to a meeting at New Hopewell (which was but small to what it was when we were there before by the reason of a Baptist meeting in the neighborhood) but the committee unitedly agreed it was a good meeting (as I was told by one of them) and to me satisfactory.

I was told the flesh on one side was quite decayed and Mary Haines, wife of Isaac, died suddenly with the palsy or a fit: an old acquaintance.

5th Month, 1793. Lodged at Caleb Lippincott’s.
20. Got to the Quarterly Meeting. James Thornton and many more worthies were there. Many of them and had the extracts read before the women separated and I could but admire the goodness of the Lord in thus favoring and following of us. Lodged at Lucas Gibbs and on looking back have to believe many precious opportunities are lost for want of more vigilance, as Peter Yarnall said the other day at Thomas Wormsley's.
21. Was youth’s meeting which was a time of weakness in general and of poverty to me in particular, though many ministers appeared and some pertinent and lively. We came up to Jonah Brown’s where, after doing some business and at Woodbury at Samuel Miccle’s, we came home.
23 and 24. About plow making.
25. Went to the burial of Hannah Stokes, an ancient woman and a very poor dull dry time it was. O what a hunger and thirst I perceived amongst the people in general after worldly greatness and a splendid appearance. A shut up time and no satisfaction.
[Right marginal note] I think they aimed to make a grand parade in the Philadelphia mode, which tended to poverty perhaps.
26. Was First Day. Came off pretty well satisfied.
27. About plow.

We came down to Mount Holly to their afternoon meeting. William Jackson and his wife and Mary Sain were there. The meeting at first was very poor, but life arose and growed better and better. William Jackson had solid time in exercising his most beautiful and most excellent gift on the subject of parents bringing their children to meeting and educating them. Mary Swain and myself had some share in the labor and meeting ended very well and we came home as far as Job Haines who had bore me company and there I lodged and went next morning to see Grace Evins who lies in a deep consumption and very low and weak. The opportunity I think was somewhat favored though rather too much hurrying, yet it was to pretty good satisfaction.
3. About plow making.
4. At our preparative meeting. Suppressed, withheld, put off.
5. I met our Committee on Spirituous Liquors at Upper Evesham. Had some Yearly Meeting minutes read. Men and women together. Things seemed low at first but growed better and a down right open favored time it was I believe, however divers expressed it.

<pb id="A0011522_013"/>

8. About home.
9. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. Solomon Gaskill was there. Life was wanting more than words and them not all to be thrown away. Went to see Grace Evans who seems in a deep decline and consumption. This afternoon had a Negro meeting which was a very poor low time. The waters were very low indeed.
10. I went to the burial of John Moxel’s son about 11 years old. Had a close siege with an easeful indolent spirit which is too apt to prevail at such times and I think got the better of it.
11. Joshua Evans, Joshua Lippincott and I went to visit Samuel Evans and his family on account of the use of spirituous liquors, then J. Lippincott and I proceeded to visit divers other families on that occasion, we being a part of the Monthly Meeting committee on that subject: L.W., Re. B. and was at Job Collins, seen I.R. a retailer and had some conference with him respecting selling it to poor people whose families suffer by their selling strong drink to them, then to William Rogers and he went with, to E.D. They mostly acknowledged the work was right and what we had to say was very well, yet not wiling to take up the cross with respect to selling it or the laying by the customary use of it in time of harvest as our Yearly Meeting hath advised. Returned home late. Very warm weather as is common to have. At work at home preparing stuff for cheese press, going to mill etc.
16. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. Indolence prevailed in to general a way. So prevalent it was, it was hard standing the tide or force of it. Went to Joseph Warrington’s afternoon. John Bizzel and wife were there but poor time. Something wanting, no true and solid peace.
17. At work at home about cheese press.
[Right marginal note] At Evesham meeting, middling well. Joshua Lippincott and I visited several families.

6. Reaping.
7th. Was First Day. At our meeting which was to good satisfaction to divers I do believe. What a favor well would it be if we could walk worthy of it and have it continue and increase.
8. Mowing etc.
9. At our meeting, which was very small. A very busy season. The people can’t spare time to attend meetings till it is a little over in the dead of winter perhaps. Winter Quakers offering to the Lord the refuse of their time. But when a little sickness lays hold or apprehensions of the approach of death, how it changes the prospect. I had satisfaction.
10:11. About our hay.
12. I went to Cropwell. A poor little low meeting no satisfaction.
13. About hay.
14. Was First Day Joseph Clerk and Richard Painter came to see me. I went with them to Cropwell and a poor low shut up time it was. Richard says it is mostly so at this season of the year. People work hard, douce into the spirit of this world till we are like creatures half drownded and so not in a capacity to perform the business. We met about a dull drowsy distressing meeting. I felt benumbed with the headache, yet I gathered this instruction: that it was not right nor never intended, though we are doomed to get our bread by the sweat of the brow [Genesis 3:19], for us to work so hard to get a living or to earn money to put into a bag with holes as to unfit us for the Lord’s service. But it is to be feared it is much the case with professors. 
Many lately read a new book <italic>The Life and [Religious] Labors of Sarah Grubb </italic>her travels in Truth’s service with George Dillwyn. I believe it is good to bathe in pure clean water, or bathing her senses in pure liquid fire, or put wood on the altar to keep it burning. See William Penn’s <italic>Select Works</italic>.
On 16 at our meeting a poor time. Could not get along to any satisfaction but far otherwise. The rest of this week about hay too much hard labor and fatigue hurts the mind.
21. Was First Day. Out of joint a little somehow, but hope for better times. R.R. had pretty service. About getting hay.
23. I had to go to town on Abigail’s account: she being ill with the flux, but pretty soon got better. The rest of this week about hay.
28. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting, came off pretty well. This afternoon I went to the burial of Grace Evans, died with the consumption. Daniel Offley* was there and had a good deal to say at the grave. Next day one of her children was buried with the flux. Finishing hay.
[Left marginal note] *Daniel Offley died in Philadelphia in the time of that great sickness soon after.
31. I went to the burial of Patience Crispin. It seemed to me it was a senseless dark spirited hardened earthly idle company as to any thing of a religious life. A poor shut up time.
{1793-08}
1 of the Eighth Month. Finishing a cheese press for Joseph Morgan.
2. Went and took Joseph Morgan’s press home [notation] all settled.
3. Getting hay again.
4. Was First Day at our meeting. It was dull forepart but ended pretty in the afternoon. I went with Solomon Gaskill* to a meeting at the new schoolhouse amongst the Methodists, or people not being too zealous and speaking too [illegible].
[Left marginal note] * Solomon Gaskill died soon after.
<pb id="A0011522_015"/>
5th of the Eighth Month, 1793. About home or hauling hay for a poor neighbor.
6. Went to our preparative meeting. John Reeve and Samuel Lippincott were there. A large meeting and they had a great deal to say but was a poor time with me. I hope it was not so with others. I was unwell and lost sleep the night before. The preparative meeting was a poor low time.
7. About getting hay home.
8. My wife and I went to Evesham Preparative Meeting. John Reeve and Samuel Lippincott were there. John had good service against a covetous worldly spirit. After meeting our Committee on Spirituous liquors got together, but the time being for spirit, preparative meeting holding late, we did but little.
9. Was Monthly Meeting. John Reeve had good service very pertinent to the states of the people. I believe the Meeting for Business was to my satisfaction in a good degree. Several shots seemed to hit the mark well too. Solomon Gaskill came home with us and we took him to Joshua Evans. Stopped on the way with my wife who was under appointment to visit a young woman, Eliza Cooper or to inform her the meeting had received her acknowledgment. Solomon and I had opportunity to drop some hints pertinent I believe to the young people.
11. Was First Day. I went to Evesham Meeting which was a time of hard labor. A great crowd not of true witnesses but of a large number of raw giddy unthoughtful youth. In the afternoon had a meeting with the Black people which was at first a low poor time, but after a time of hard labor it growed better and ended lively and well to good satisfaction. It seemed like laboring hard all day. Got the penny at last.
12. About home.
13. Went to our meeting. John Cox was there and thought we had something pretty lively and were united in labor and sympathy though the labor was not very pleasant. Word came to Jonah the second time etc. <note resp="transcr">Jonah 3:1</note>  14. About home.

16 and 17. About a pump for Edmund Hollinshead, 16 feet 4 inches long. Got home.
18. Was First Day. Went to our meeting. Something was the matter. Could not would not or did not get along to satisfaction.
19. My wife [and] I met the large committee at Evesham. The committee gave in lively account of their attention and labor in the matter recommended in our extracts which seemed comfortable and strengthening. This afternoon friends had a further conference respecting dividing our Monthly Meeting in which I met with some trials not pleasant and strengthening but far otherwise.
20. Went to our meeting which to me was low and laborious hard.
21. About a pump for Sarah Burroughs.
22. At do and I went to the burial of Lucreci Ellis, a young woman who died with the flux and had [obscured by dirt] deranged in mind some years, whose mother was an old acquaintance. Had a pretty good solid opportunity at the house: but there was need of more watchfulness and care soon after.
22. At work at the pump and went to Cropwell Meeting. A poor low time. Finished the pump, 24 feet long, all settled.
24. About home and went to the burial of David Claypol’s son eight years old, died with the flux. I had an opportunity of making some remarks to the people etc. which I believe were pertinent though there seemed a lowness and raw. 
25. Was First Day. A very stormy day. At our meeting. Came off pretty well.
26. I went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting. First sitting very low, though James Thorington had some service, that for business was pretty well. I came off very well. A feather in the cap not the block this time. Thomas Scattergood was there but silent.

27 of the Eighth Month, 1793. Was their youth’s meeting. James Thornton had extensive service. Charles Williams and I went to see a Negro man under sentence of death for stealing. He said he was willing to die but I was afraid he was not deep and weighty enough.
At this time there was a very alarming account of a great mortality in Philadelphia. Many died very sudden with a disorder something like the plague and many left the town for fear, and we hear that the flux is very mortal in divers places, abundance of people dying with it.
28. About home. I was taken very poorly latter part of this week with a complaint very prevalent, almost general, like a bad cold. Some call it influensey. Very distressing but I kept about.
{1793-09}
1 of the 8th [sic] Month 1793. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. though very poorly it was an open favored satisfactory time to me and I could not perceive but that it was generally satisfactory.* Oh what a favor continued.
[marginal note:] * Thomas Harrison from town was there. 
2nd. Went to Joseph Warrington’s with my son Joseph about buying some land of Jacob Burr, but I was very unwell.
3. I went to our preparative meeting. Joshua Evans was there. It was a very low tide, the waters were low. I wish I had crouched down and suffered. Joshua, I believe, found hard getting along. Poor times answering queries, dryness and formality, no satisfaction. Ready to wish I had stayed at home for I thought I was poorly enough to do so. A poor time. We hear that the sickness prevails and increases and many flee from town.
4 and 5. About home very poorly.
6. I went to Monthly Meeting. Samuel Wilson was there and I had extensive service. The meeting was very large, that for business not all together so well as I could wish. I lodged with Joshua Evans at William Snowden’s.
7. We went to our select meeting. Samuel Wilson had close pertinent searching service on the subject of a worldly spirit and doing as we would be done by in dealing etc.
8. Was First Day. I was yet very poorly but went to our meeting and a highly favored time it was to me, J.C. owned me, open and satisfactory and very large. I received a letter from my beloved friend Thomas Harrison, wherein he mentions that the sickness increases so that the relations of the deceased follow not the corpse to the grave as usual nor make such a parade as he terms it as usual now. See my account 25th of the Fifth Month last of the burial of Hannah Stokes.
9. About sowing etc.
10. Went to our meeting. Had something to do but was sorry to feel the life of true religion so low in our meeting. Deadness, dryness, dullness. 
Thomas Harrison from Philadelphia was here and informed me that the sickness prevailed and spread in the city. People died very fast and sudden so that thousands have moved into the country and are still moving out very fast so that business there is very much stopped and houses and stores much shut up. Joseph Dubre was here to see us and told me that the town seemed solitary or desolate the countenance of the people much changed and the streets as thin and still on weekdays as they used to be on First Day and one thing very remarkable that in this sickness and great mortality the Negroes had not been very little if any affected with the distemper in burying the dead, so that they are employed in waiting on the white people in a way very different from what they used to be. A very great and sudden change of times and things indeed, which stains the glory of all earthly things and turns the world upside down. See Acts 17 and 6, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also. About home sowing the rest of the week. Met with a very [illegible] trial this week, hard to [illegible].
<pb id="A0011522_017"/>
15th of the Ninth Month, 1793. I was at our meeting. To me silent and dullness yet prevailed. I was informed that just before this sickness began there was a young new married woman died in the city and they had a mahogany coffin plated with burnished gold and a kind of black curtains round the bottom which they call a paul [pall]. I was at a burial at Newtown some years ago where J. Burroughs told me that there was a double coffin but I did not look into the grave to see it, but he seemed displeased with it and said it seemed as if they thought their deceased connections were too good to touch the ground. And indeed I have often thought of that passage of scripture, see Deuteronomy 28:56, The tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness etc. See verse the next, 57. But now they bury people they say often times without coffins and abundance of them that have coffins are made without plaining and entirely without their great forms and parade as usual at burials. We hear daily of the increase and spreading of the sickness all round us, burials almost every day and people afraid to go to burials or visit the sick. They bury them chiefly in the night it said in town.
16. About home but poorly. Seeding etc. 
17. At our meeting. Had something to do to satisfaction, healing.
18. About home.
19. I went to select meeting at Haddonfield. John Reeve had lively service. A time of deep trial appointing representatives to attend the Yearly Meeting on account of the great mortality and sickness which greatly rages and increases. Friends were left to their liberty to give up their names, none being free or easy to nominate. A few gave in their names but none with that that clearness and courage like Elizabeth Collins, who said her mind had been much drawn towards the city. William Rogers, John Collins, Reeve, Joshua Evans, Martha Allins, and Mary Swett were set down and in the Quarterly Meeting my name was set and I think some few others (B Swett) which were named at the select meeting. After all friends were left to their liberty and feeling.
20. Was Quarterly Meeting. Benjamin Reeve and Mary Newbold had lively solemn solid weighty pertinent service. The business was low and flat old fashioned yet I had a shot or two.
21. We had the company of some friends from Virginia. Rowland Richards and wife and Mary Haines.
22. Was First Day. Went to our meeting. John Cox was there and had lively service and we came off pretty well.

24. Solomon and I went to see Mary Haddock at Thomas Thoms. Had a pretty comfortable little sitting with them and then went to our meeting. Rowland Richards was there. He and Solomon had a good deal to say. I thought it a dull low time.

30. About gathering corn.
{1793-10}
1 of the Tenth Month, 1793. Went to our meeting. Dullness and heaviness prevailed. Notwithstanding the language of mortality never sounded louder in the land. A hundred or more died in a day in the city as it is said and many all around us in the country almost daily.
2, Gathering corn.
[Left marginal note] Solomon Gaskill died with the flux and was buried the 25 of the Eleventh Month 1793.
<pb id="A0011522_018"/>
3rd of the Tenth Month and Fifth [Day] of the week, 1793. My wife and I went to the burial of Sarah White, daughter of Samuel White and granddaughter of the worthy Joseph White, a young woman died of a fever at N. Barton’s. I had a hard struggle with a light floating spirit amongst the youth and I thought rather gained some ground to some satisfaction. We stopped at Martha Allinson where there was a company of Black people at a wedding. We had a sitting with them to some advantage I hope.
4. About gathering corn.
5. I went in the afternoon to fit up a pump for William Matlack, all settled.
6. Was First Day. Went to our meeting. A poor dull hard time. I wish I had patiently suffered under it in silence.
[Right marginal note] Held meeting too long and did not get the penny at last. I.C. came to see me this evening.
7. About gathering corn etc.
8. Was at our preparative meeting. Through diffidence and fear I kept what I had to myself and concluded to crouch down in the time of the business, but when self was put down way opened for something to satisfaction.
9 and 10. We made a pump for John Barton 18 feet long, all settled. I was at Newtown Meeting which was small and poor yet came off pretty well at last.
11. At our Monthly Meeting. Hannah Reeve was there and spoke largely. The Quarters Committee was there. John Tatham and others on the subject of dividing the Monthly Meeting and fixing the day to hold of the week the new meeting, on which was concluded to be held on Seventh Day. A poor shattered time though I had one shot to good satisfaction with some strength and authority.
12. Hauling in corn etc. We hear daily of the calamity and mortality increasing in the city and of the death of divers worthy Friends: Huson Langstroth and William Savery and that Daniel Offley’s death was confirmed, but we are in hopes that William Savery is yet remaining. Accounts of the death of many of our valuable useful members are taken away.
14. About getting in corn.
15. Went to our meeting. Hannah Reeve was there all silent.
16. Attending to some business of the preparative meeting between T. H. and J.H. and I put a new box in J. Hollinshead pump.

18. Brother Abn Wills came to see us on a visit; I having some business went with him as far as Mullica Hill.
19. I went to look [for] timber for Aaron Pencost’s pump at Mullica Hill, 58 feet long.
20. Was First Day, went to our meeting and it was a time of favor with me. A good solid lively time. Hannah Reeve was there. I went to Aaron Pencost at Mullica Hill to make a pump about 58 feet long, finished it on Fifth Day evening, all settled.
[25.] Sixth Day. Went to work at a pump for George Tailor which had been made by a man that did not understand the business. I had a great deal of trouble with it, but made it do well at last. We bored a pump ten feet long for a fuller then came home. Such hurrying and driving and worrying seemed to wound and to me seemed like taking bribes.
27. Was First Day at our meeting. A poor low silent time to me.
29. At our meeting, a good favored time to good satisfaction.
30. I finished Plum’s pump, 21 feet long.
<pb id="A0011522_019"/>

6. I went to Joseph Champion’s and Joseph Plum’s.
7. I was making a pump for Joseph Champion at Colestown, 16 [feet] long.
8. At our Monthly Meeting. Ezra Comfort was there and had good service. The business was not altogether to satisfaction, got too much on the high horse. More humility is wanting and weightiness and watchfulness.
9. At select meeting, met at the 9th hour. Ezra Comfort and Hannah Reeve was there. I thought it was rather a healing gathering edifying comfortable time, yet thought if more faithfulness was kept to, we might have experienced [a] larger degree of heavenly influence or the celestial showers.
[Left marginal note] Before meeting I put in and finished Champion’s pump.
This afternoon after our select meeting Ezra Comfort appointed a meeting at Moorestown which was large and a solid good meeting. Ezra had extensive service.
10. Was First Day at our meeting. One of the most favored times I ever had.* A precious meeting. I thought John Collins was a little proud about it. It seemed to me he could push a boat to set a float to go abroad by what he said. I went to visit the sick and the fatherless and widow Keen and Joseph Matlack. Lodged at brother Joseph Warrington’s.
[Left marginal note] *Pride is as apt to grow on our virtues as on our vices. He that grows better, let him beware lest he grow proud, lest vain glory give him a greater over throw than his former vices. [William Law; see entry for November 22, 1776] A good state [illegible].

20. Had a meeting at Alloway’s Creek which was a very poor time with me, but Ezra came off very well. Rode down to Greenwich.
21. Had a meeting there which was a very low suffering time. It was their preparative meeting and at last we had some service to good satisfaction [and] parted sweet and well with them.
22. We rode 45 miles through the barren lands in 8 hours and 20 minutes – this is a desolate road, it was a comfort to see the least token of the living along it even the mark of an axe – to Mark Townsend’s on Cape May.
23. Had a meeting there which was a low suffering time at first but we were owned and favored at last. A time of favor with me. Rode about ten miles to the bay. Left our horses and crossed the bay about three miles in a small batto [bateau] and quite dark cloudy and windy so that the water flew over and wet us some. Traveled three miles and very dark to the widow Scull’s to lodge.*
*Marmaduke Cooper’s was there and went to the beach after his cattle and lightly talked whether man was made for the Sabbath or that for man, but he and his wife died soon after.
24. Was First Day. Had a meeting on Great Egg harbor, which was small and long a gathering and very low and dull at first, yet it ended well and divers seemed tendered and reached. Rode to Josiah Leeds to lodge and was at their meeting which was a favored time with Ezra.
25. We crossed over the waters four miles to Little Egg Harbor. Our bateau was small and the wind pretty high and the water rude and rough. We went to Barnegat, near twenty miles from where we landed. Had a sitting in Richard Osburn's family, he being terrible bad with a cancer, his nose being eaten all away so that he could hardly talk. It was a pretty good time, something savory and satisfactory.
[Right marginal note] He died soon after.
27. Had a meeting there which was very low and small. The service of the meeting fell on myself. Came off pretty well. Here our guide John Ridgeway was taken very poorly with a dizziness and trembling so that he could not walk without help but got better so as to ride home fifteen miles. Lodged at Jonah Smith’s.
28. Had a meeting at Clam-town [Tuckerton] which was as well as we could expect considering things are so very low amongst them. Went to Jonathan Smith’s and had a sitting with them and some other friends too. I hope profit. An exceeding great storm this evening.
29. He took us up to Batstow [Batsto] where there was a young man near expiring to all appearances, though sensible. We met our horses here and rode to Joshua Owins through the wilderness and about eight or nine miles. It was so dark we could hardly keep the road but got safe along.

[Left marginal note] A rainy day
[Right marginal note] Perils by land and perils by sea we had to pass through.

2nd of the Third Month 1794 was First Day I went to Evesham Meeting which was full crowded, many idle and raw. The forepart was a suffering time but it ended to good satisfaction something like an owning gathering time. All seemed sweet and pleasant when meeting broke up. My friends seemed to own me. I went to Job Haines and to see James Eldrige who for some years had wholly neglected meetings. Found hard work but came off pretty well at last. Lodged at William Rogers’s.
3. William Rogers and I went to Joseph Powel’s to meet Thomas Rogers in order to settle some business of a Black man which had lain nine or ten years which we accomplished better than we expected. Then to Samuel Carr’s on the same business, then homeward. A violent heavy rain and wind.

A favor yet continued.
8. Was our select meeting which was in a good degree favored.
9. Was First Day at our meeting and a poor low humbling mortifying time it was. Forced to drop anchor abruptly. Perhaps it is the food most convenient for me. <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 30:8</note> 
10. I went down to Mullica Hill. Took the boys to make a pump for Rebekah Lippincott 54 feet long. All settled and we got back Sixth Day night very late.
15. Rainy, about home trimming apple trees.

Had some minutes read pertinent to the heads of families. This the third meeting at this time of the year and all favored lively. The strangers came home with us.
18. They were at our meeting. A poor shut up time. All silent. A very full large meeting.
19. I went up to Upper Evesham with the strangers which was long and we came off pretty well. [There was] a marriage Isaac Haines and widow Bu[same name]. We had a meeting at Cropwell this afternoon. Hard labor but I hope it ended pretty well.
20. Went to select meeting at Haddonfield which I thought was low and dull the forepart but it was pretty well and edifying at last. Divers Friends came to the burial of Theodocia Vinicomb. Thomas Scattergood had excellent service at the grave and Arthur Howill and Nathan Smith a pretty deal to say.
21. At Quarterly Meeting Thomas Scattergood was raised in great eminence and very large and powerful In his testimony. At this meeting Joshua Evans got liberty to visit New England after thirteen or fourteen years struggle. After meeting I went to Joshua Evans to lodge. Had a satisfactory opportunity with them at parting of which he said he was glad.
22. Went to select meeting at Philadelphia and attended these meetings till the conclusion which was on Second Day evening. At divers of these meetings the beauty appeared in solemn silence in the aged ministers and in several young ministers. Got home Third Day and found several of our family very poorly. The rest of this week I was about home sowing flax barley and clover and made one plow for Samuel Thorn.
Divers of our most experienced ministers seemed to unite in an apprehension of a time of trial, a storm approaching. We hear of terrible wars over great part of the world and I have thought the clouds of confusion seemed to heave in sight. Great wars on the seas. abundance of our vessels [illegible] taken by the Algerians and English. <note resp="transcr">The manuscript shows that Hunt originally wrote "Algerians & French," but crossed out and corrected this.</note>  An embargo laid on our vessels. Salt 15 a bushel.

For some years past there has a thought struck my mind when I have beheld the superfluity in eating drinking and in furniture, the most enormous pitch of pride and luxury our country has got into, whether the time would not come wherein the channel through which these luxuries have flowed in upon us would not be stopped up and* now there seems a great prospect of it and it may be the food the most convenient for us <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 30:8</note> , for we have abused prosperity and is it not fit we should be chastised?
The ferryman told me that he was told by a man that lately come from one of the islands that he saw a thousand men killed in one night and it is said two hundred of our vessels are taken by the Algerians and English and now they say an embargo is laid on our vessels and salt 15 shillings a bushel.
30 of the Third, 1794. Was First Day. I went to our meeting and a highly favored time it was with me open and truly satisfactory.

Here I was amongst a dismal drunken stinking low lived [low-life] pack of hardened wretches which was a lesson of instruction to me. At the magistrate’s court, a drunken sot himself and most of the jury like him. I had to lament with the philosopher (William Penn mentions) to see good laws in bad men’s hands: <italic>No Cross No Crown,</italic> page 283, Demonax.

11. Went to Monthly Meeting which was very large although we so lately divided, the upper meetings taken of, yet they were hardly missed. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, April 1794: "Friends at the Preparative Meeting at Evesham reported that Thomas Haines hath been treated with for being guilty of unchastity with a young Woman who he hath since consummated marriage with; John Hunt and Samuel Borton, are appointed to take a solid opportunity with him, and report their sense of her disposition of Mind to next Meeting."</note>  The house crowded full below and some above stairs and we were favored: William Ashby, William Goodwin, Joshua Evans and Hannah Reeve. The service fell to Joshua Evans who is about to go on a visit to New England. I thought there was a solemn holy heavenly quiet covered the meeting at the conclusion of the first sitting and in that for business life was prevalent. I had good satisfaction yet some little misses.
12. I and my boys made a plow for Joseph Coles and one for Samuel Thorn and got home two logs for a pump for David Davis.
13. Was First Day. It seemed to me there was an improvement in the orderly sitting in solemn silence in our meeting. I do think it was a pretty good solid meeting and ended well and although I made some little misses in quotations John Collins says we have had highly favored meetings of late.

24. Proceeded and got to their select meeting. John Reeve was there and had some service and myself some share in the labor. Things seemed low though there was some life. I went with friends to Stony Brook, twelve miles, lodged at Benjamin Clerks.
25. Was First Day. Went to Stony Brook meeting. Rebekah Wright, Lydia Hoskins and Mary West was there and Benjamin Clerk, Friends in the ministry. There were a number of very raw unsettled people there. After a time of hard labor we seemed to get the victory and it ended well. A Negro meeting was appointed there to begin at two so we sat down with them without going to get dinner and this meeting was favored and ended well to good satisfaction. The Negroes were almost all slaves and behaved orderly. We went to
<pb id="A0011522_026"/>
then went to Benjamin Clerks to get dinner and went to the burying ground to the burial of Isaac Clerk. At the grave I had something to communicate. Lodged again [at] Benjamin Clerk’s.
26. We went to the house of Isaac Clerk. Had a sitting with the widow and children which was owned in a good degree. We, that is, R. Wright, L. Hoskins and M. West being much united in the labor wherein suitable counsel was delivered. Then we came down to Chesterfield to the Quarterly Meeting. There was a very large gathering, the weighty part hardly a ballast for the light part. John Reeve was there and spoke very well but it was a time suffering with me. However in the time of the business I had some several good shots and we got the better of that light airy floating spirit and all ended well and Friends showed very respectful. I lodged at cousin Peter Ellis’s and settled some business with him concerning a legacy left to us by our uncle Peter Harvey. Went to see Aunt Ann and cousin John Harvey and had a sitting with them and came off middling well I hope.
27. I came homeward, stopped at Joshua Newbould's and there I had some religious labor with them and old James Gaskill, a man of great wit, but few, if any, use it worse. A poor drunken creature. I had a close conference with him and he seemed to take it very well, as well as his son who seems to be like to make much such a man as his father. Then came home and found all pretty well except our youngest son having got a fall off a colt and hurt his leg pretty much.
[Left marginal note] 1805 I was told this old drunkard fell in the road and died suddenly.

3. Was our preparative meeting. Some better than common.
4 and 5. About home.
6. Was Monthly Meeting. Elizabeth Collins there. The first sitting ended solid and well. The business was lively forepart but it seemed to me at last like the pond run out. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, June 1794: "The Friends appointed to attend the marriage of Job Haines and Martha Ballinger reported attention thereto, and that it appeared to be orderly accomplished, excepting that it was consummated at upper Evesham particular meeting; which latter circumstance being exercising to many minds, it appeared the united sense of the Meeting, that John Collins, William Rogers, John Roberts, and John Hunt be appointed to take a solid opportunity with the parties above named, and their parents on the occasion, and report their sense therein to the next meeting."</note>

8. Was First Day at Evesham. A hard time getting along. A committee went this afternoon to visit Thomas Ballinger's family concerning their observing of times* about their daughter’s marriage. But a poor time with them though I believe we were right in doing what we could. 
[Left marginal note]*what is an observer of times in Scripture phrase (Deuteronomy 18:10)
9. About home.
10. At our meeting, a low time. The rest of this week I was about home finishing two cheese presses, one for Nathan Lippincott and one for William Black. Took Lippincott home. All settled. Did something at corn plowing etc. Hannah Reeves and me went to see a poor family. John Crosley had a favored time.
First Day, 15. At our meeting. Hannah Reeve was there. So so about home. Nothing remarkable this week.

{1794-07}
1st 3rd. Monthly Meeting with a very close pinching trial.
2. Went to our meeting which was not the worst to me. I had an opening but there was something so in my way. I kept it which I since believe was not best. The rest of this week we were reaping except some wet weather Seventh Day afternoon. I mended Thomas Hollinshead's pump.
4. I reaped an acre a day several days running without mol[asses], sugar or rum. Very hot weather.
<pb id="A0011522_027"/>
6th of the Seventh Month, 1794 was First Day. I was very poorly but went to meeting. A favored time in a good degree; however John Collins seemed well pleased with me; only I held meeting too late, but it was unsettled a while a girl had a fit or fainted.
7. About home. Wet weather.
8. Was preparative meeting. Some life [during] first sitting but in that for business lowness and death. What is the cause of such feeling weakness and lowness in our preparative meetings so generally?
9 and 10. Getting in our grain etc.
11. Was Monthly Meeting which on the whole I thought was a time of uncommon low water. It felt like our preparative meeting but yet at time some things were lively spoken to and was better at last.
12. Wet weather. At work at a pump and mended one for Richard S. Smith. All settled.
13 of the Seventh Month, Was First Day. At our meeting which to me seemed very well. A day of favor. I handed out about several pieces of writing tending to stir up the indolent, Dennis Gisehels and Hannah Tripp etc.
24. About our hay, tending corn. Went to Jose's lot Second Day to work at fences etc. This week only Third Day at our meeting which did very well lively I believe.
27 of the Seventh Month. Was First Day. John Collis and myself having proposed to our Monthly Meeting the appointing a meeting at the new schoolhouse below Moorestown which was granted and held this day. William Savery was there and it was agreed that it was a solid good meeting from first to last and I believe ended to general satisfaction and reputation. William Savery had savory service. See 4 of the Eighth Month 1793. We had a meeting there.
[Left marginal note] After meeting had a sitting at J. Waton’s which was to good satisfaction.
28. About hay.
29. At our meeting, which was a lively time to me although we were douc'd [doused] about in the heat wet [with?] sweat etc. etc.
{1794-08}
3 of the Eighth Month. Was First Day. A very rainy day. I went to Cropwell. If I was a burden to them they were very deceitful for they were very respectful after meeting. After meeting I went to the widow Allinson’s. There were some young women from town with the family. We had sitting which ended well as I thought the meeting did end very savory and well. A time of favor.*
[Left marginal note] <italic>* </italic>Rheubin Haines Jr.: was there and shot himself soon after
4. About hay. Very wet time.
5. At our weekday meeting 
[Interlinear note] This must have been preparative. 
Lowish but came off middling. This afternoon I went with Enoch Evans and his wife and Samuel White over to Byberry in part to visit James Thorington who lies very ill in a deep consumption. We had several little settings with him. He appeared to be in the innocency and heavenly quiet seemed to fill the room and is not this a crown of life: a crown of glory which the apostle said all should receive who loved the appearance of our lord and savior Jesus Christ <note resp="transcr">James 1:12 or Revelation 2:10</note> . Peter Yarnall, James Simpson and divers other choice Friends, Samuel Gomery and others with whose company I was comforted and strengthened and edified.
[there was substantial confusion about the dates for the next few weeks, with later attempts at correction. Some dates must have multiple entries.]
6. At Byberry Monthly Meeting the forepart was to my satisfaction but answering queries is dull work as Peter Yarnall then hinted. A memorial was read for James Thorington Sr. and abundance of other business which held late. The young people run away after passing and many of the older ones so it en[d]ed but poor. I went this evening to visit Ruth Kirks as was now Wormsby and lodged at William Walton’s.
7. Went to see Ann Hampton and there I think we had a sweet time in sitting in the family. Then she and Ruth and me with others visited the school which was as well as we could expect. Indeed I thought it a savory time. Came home this afternoon and finished hay this week.
10. Was First Day at our meeting, an open time and pretty well.
11. About home.
12. At preparative meeting things did not go to my m[illegible].

19. At our meeting, so middling. I think I was favored at last but John Cox was quite shut up.

19. At our meeting which I thought was middling well but J: C: L : S[illegible]er. 
The rest of this week about home cutting briers etc. Made a plow for J. Rogers. I forgot, I mended a pump for William Crispin and one for J. Rogers and went up after pine logs for a pump for John Inskeep and was at Cropwell Meeting which was small but it was a time of favor at last or some of us was mistaken. I thought I had good satisfaction they treated me with regard and true respect.
24. Was First Day. A very rainy time till near 11. A small meeting but came off very well I believe.
This week I made two pumps and three plows: one pump for John Inskeep Jr. 40 feet 3 [inches] long, all settled and one pump for Samuel Haines 16 feet long, all settled. Lodged one night with brother Aaron Will and one with brother Joseph Buzby and one night with my near friend Joshua Lippincott whose company was very agreeable and sweetly uniting and I was at a vendue William Evans amongst a company of dismal drunken sots.
[Left marginal note] James Thorington Jr. was buried.
31. Was First Day. I appointed an afternoon meeting at Cropwell and was at their meeting which was to me an open satisfactory time but that in the afternoon was a hard laborious poor time to me. The weather was exceeding warm which hurt the meeting. I seen one of the women sweat quite through her gown. A very raw company gawping for words, a disposition that should be famished to death.
About plow making this week and was our preparative meeting. Hannah Reeve was there and spoke very well. Some of my friends and me cannot agree. Some seem to want to have our state represented very whole and clear, against which my business has always been to contend.
{1794-09}
5 of the Ninth Month. Was Monthly Meeting. The forepart was lively and savory but there was so much business and for want of an inward travel at last I fear it was too much like out of doors work against which may we be guarded.
6. Was select meeting. So so middling.
7. Was First Day. Very stormy. Went to our meeting which was but small, but to me to good satisfaction. My apprentice lad appeared in the ministry. What to think of it hardly time. Time makes manifest.

[Right marginal note] I went First Day evening to see Noah Haines who lies very ill.
16. We went to the burial of Noah Haines. I had something to say at the house which seemed to have a good effect. In the afternoon I went to the burial of an old Negro woman at Micajah Wills. The Negroes behaved very sober and well but some of the white people kept talking before the door till they heard something said and then came gathering up. Came off middling, but at the grave I had an highly favored time. Joshua Lippincott told me he seen several tendered so that the tears run down their faces. 
The rest of this week about finishing a seeding and making cider.
21. Was First Day. I have this remark to make respecting the state of the people both in the city and many places in the country. Last year about this time the yellow fever raged in the city so that many hundred fled and paleness and fear and humility covered the faces of thousands. But now they are all in an uproar – fifing and drumming and enlisting in the city, and exercising or learning the art of war in the country. And raising an army to go to war with the back western inhabitants at Fort Pitt and there away about their refusing to pay their taxes on their distilleries.
It has been brewing here ever since I was there two years ago and I have many times thought it was likely that their iniquities would be suffered to correct them and their backslidings reprove them for their wickedness in distilling the grain, as they have this many years past, so that for some months a few years ago, some were forced to live without bread, as I was informed in letter by one of my friends from Redstone. 
I went to our meeting. Hannah Reeve was there all pretty middling well.
22. About home.
23. At our meeting. Did pretty well only put off and held meeting too long which I have been to apt to do.

27. About home not at town at select meeting as usual which is a cross.
28. Was First Day. I went to Evesham Meeting words were not wanting yet it was not satisfactory to me though I believe some were well pleased. After meeting I went to see Patience Wane from Redstone and her mother my kinswoman Patience Moor who is very poorly.
29. I went to Philadelphia to select meeting. Deborah Darby and Rebekah Young from Europe had most excellent service. A solemn good meeting.
I attended the several settings of this meeting both select and yearly which were some of them highly favored precious seasons greatly to my edification. I was on the committee appointed to draw epistles which was an instructing school, though I was stripped naked to see others younger than I outstrip me. I was much stripped after times but its like it is the food most convenient yet I had. 
{1794-10}
[4.] Seventh Day. I dined at the widow Lewis’ with Deborah Darby and Rebekah Young from Europe.
<pb id="A0011522_030"/>
5th of the Tenth Month, 1794. Was First Day. My wife and I went to Cropwell Meeting which was small but to pretty good satisfaction. After meeting we went to see [my] sister Abigail Evans who lies very ill of a fever. A general complaint in most families this fall.

12. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting which was small much sickness being in the neighborhood. After some time I thought I saw an opening upon which I stood up and expressed a few sentences I thought very well, but all closed up and I sat down very abruptly, but at last labored through pretty well. After meeting I went again to see my sister who lies very ill but much resigned to die.
13. About our corn.
14. Went to our meeting, a distressed dull poor shut up time to me. Worked too hard.
15. Went again to see my sister yet very low and weak.
16. About our corn.

18. About getting in corn.
19. Was First Day at our meeting. Benjamin Swet and his wife were there and both spoke. He had a great deal to say. Meeting held late and not fully to the satisfaction of some. I had a share in the labor and to good satisfaction.
20. About in gathering corn and apples and potatoes etc.
21. Our sister lies very ill. Went to see her again. Stayed all night and next day.
25. We went to the burial of our poor afflicted sister Abigail Evans, which was a shut up poor time to me and no wonder all things considered.* (a very stormy day) My poor sister was sorely afflicted both in body and mind though as to her own inward state I believe as she said there was not much in her way. She said she was resigned to die but could not be resigned to live only on account of her children. She discovered a great concern and desire that she could do something for the good of her husband and children. Her sickness was a fever and very sick stomach, vomiting and flux. At divers times as I was with her she prayed for mercy and that she might have an easy passage saying, O Lord Jesus Christ be pleased to take me, expressing a hope that her time would not be long and at last was very sensible but a few minutes before she went off and seemed to have an easy passage at last.
* The wrong prevailed over the right spirit. Now it is too late. I see where I missed it in not saying what appeared to me at the house.
26. Was First Day. Very stormy meeting. Small but I thought pretty solid.
27. About home getting in apples etc.

3. About home making cider etc.
4. At our meeting, a poor trying time this week. Sore trials exceed all pretty well. Some satisfaction though I omitted an opening in the first sitting which with other things my spirit was depressed and much dejected.

24 of the First Month 1795. Deborah Basit and Lititia Craig was at our meeting in the course of their religious visit and a solid good meeting I think it was, favored with a livening affecting ministry and a solemn quiet: the best of tokens, and a beautiful crown and a diadem. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 28:5</note>  I had a little share with them and satisfaction. (This was a most violent stormy day.) The whole need not the physician <note resp="transcr">Matthew 9:12</note>  but these meetings were healing to me.

9. At our meeting. A poor low time but ended better a little.
10. About home finishing hay. There has been of late for some weeks past abundance of rain and the weather very hot. It’s likely thousands and thousands of pounds worth of hay and grass is spoiled with the great rains and freshes and in some places in Pennsylvania we hear of vast great damages done amongst the mills. Abundance of hay here away spoiled and swept off with the freshets. To me the long cloudy and rainy weather seemed awful and threatening. 
And I remembered Job’s language: the Lord gives and the Lord takes away <note resp="transcr">Job 1:21</note> . He can bless a little or blast a great deal. He has many ways. He can take away by too much wet or too much dry weather. 
I remember old Samuel Atkinson told me that they once thought the staff of bread would have been cut off by the rain after the grain was shocked in the harvest fields (called the wet harvest). I remember once seeing an account in the papers of a famine in Germany on account of the abundance of wet and I have known people who live on the best of our lands and farms forced to fodder in the Ninth Month on account of the drought and now some of our best farmers talk of buying hay, their grass and pasture is so spoiled. A talk of cattle growing cheap. I have known fields of corn withered and almost dried up with the drought by harvest, but this year exceeded all I ever remember for a growing season, the field covered with white clover all the forepart of summer.
11. At our meeting, a sad time to me all to pieces undone.

30 of the Eighth Month. Was First Day. At our meeting. Hannah Reeve was there and I thought had good service but it was a mortifying time to me. Got aground on the shoals. Yarnall had excellent service in the meeting for business. I had a share of the labor with my brethren and they owned me as a brother. John Simpson was there and oh! what a favor yet continued: to be a little time with them. Next day I was at our meeting, lowish. This week I made a pump for William Matlack* at Evesham and was at Cropwell Preparative Meeting and went to see Mich Wills who is very ill of a fever.

{1795-09}
6 of the Ninth Month 1795. Was First Day, not altogether satisfactory.
7. About getting ready for sowing fitting up some plows etc.
8. Was our preparative meeting and a favored time it was to me.
9 and 10. About sowing and we went to the burial of Esther Wilkins widow. It was not so favored a time as some I have seen though I hope for improving.
11. Was Monthly Meeting, came off pretty well. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, September 1795: "Said meeting [Evesham Preparative Meeting</note> further reported that John Jonens requests to be in Membership with Friends. John Hunt and John Collins are appointed to visit him, inquire into the grounds of his convincement and report to next Meeting."] 
12. Was our select meeting and to me low and poor to what I could wish.
13. Was First Day. A very rainy morning. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting and I do believe it was a favored time, sweetly satisfactory in general. I thought I seen tokens of it after meeting.

24. I went to select meeting at Haddonfield which to me was a very poor low time though John Reeve and Samuel Smith had good service.
25. Was Quarterly Meeting which was to me a distressing poor time the forepart, but the clouds broke away and it ended well. J. Reeve and S. Smith had extensive service. Warner Mifflin and I had a satisfactory time amongst the women.
26. I went to select meeting at Philadelphia which was a most precious highly favored time. I thought I hardly ever seen such a shuteing [shooting] match before. Deborah Darby and Rebecca Young and Joseph Cloud and John Wigham from Scotland were there and held till they spare no arrows. Adjourned to half past three and held till they lit candles and then I came home some unwell. I thought the sentences of some of these valiants deserved to be transmitted to the latest generations. Their lights shined and they were as lighted candles to search Jerusalem <note resp="transcr">Zephaniah 1:12</note> .
27. Was First Day at our meeting, somewhat favored but so-so middling.
28. I went to the select meeting at Philadelphia met 10 hour and an highly favored time it was. Joseph Cloud from Carolina had most excellent service towards ministers and elders. He seemed to see the danger of their falling into a state of ease and carnal security. Deborah Darby and Rebecca Young from England and John Wigham from Scotland were there, most beautiful sweet ministers who throughout the course of the week had most excellent service. Some settings to me were tiring and low times but some to me were highly favored lively times. And John De Marse Lak from France who spoke by an interpreter and had weighty service. meeting concluded about 10 at night and friends thought it was a very favored time upon the whole.
[Left marginal note] On the state of society we had a smart lively time exceeded all as I thought. Some sharp shooting.
{1795-10}
4 of the Tenth Month. Was First Day. At our meeting. I believe it was a good solid meeting though it might have been better on some accounts.
[Right marginal note] At our Yearly Meeting we were brought at times to the banqueting house and as to a feast of fat things to a table spread with dainties and plenty of the wine of the kingdom from the lees well refined <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 25:6</note> .
<pb id="A0011522_043"/>
At this time the yellow fever we hear is very mortal and rages at New York as it did at Philadelphia two years ago. Last year it raged at Baltimore and some other inland towns.
5th of the Tenth Month, 1795. About our corn gathering.
6th. Was preparative meeting which was not to be complained of.
7. About our corn husking and hauling stalks and corn.
9. Was Monthly Meeting. Peter Yarnall was there and Ben Swet and both spoke pretty largely. Peter dropped a hint again of a day of close trials and troubles coming on the land.
The meeting for Business was a very poor time.
8 of last week was a very wet day. My wife and I and John Collins and his wife visited Samuel Evans and wife, and Samuel Darnel and wife and John and I had an opportunity with John Jones who had requested to be joined to friends. This days work was to satisfaction.
10. About getting in corn and apples etc. A great rain again Seventh Day night.
11. Was First Day. At our meeting. Claton Brown, a very promising young minister was there but seemed to have hard work did very well.
12. About our corn till noon then I was called off and had to go up in Evesham after a colt strayed away. I lodged with Job and Elizabeth Collins who with their children have been and still are sorely afflicted. He thinks he has a cancer on his breast broke out and they lately buried two children and others yet very ill. I think they bear their afflictions with fortitude and Christian patience.
13. I visited two very sick persons, Jesse Lippincott and Mathias Lidinmire. A very sickly mortal time. I have more calls to visit the sick and to attend burials than I can attend to though I should give up all the week. Hannah Prickit, a young woman, buried this week and cousin John Harvey who it was supposed was taken in a fit and fell in the fire and was burned so that he died after suffering about two weeks. He had one fit some time before and was subject to drink too much. A young man in the very bloom and prime of life. He left three children as his parent did about twenty-five years before, left him and two more.
18. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. Samuel Borton was buried. Reuben Hilliar and Samuel Atkinson, [a] young minister, were here and I thought we had a favored meeting.

29. Finish Willard’s pump. He paid 3 dollars, remained 3 unpaid.

{1795-11}
1 of the Eleventh Month. Was First Day. At our meeting. Made out but poorly I thought, but one of my friends thought otherwise.
<pb id="A0011522_044"/>
1 of the Tenth Month, 1795. This afternoon I went to Philadelphia with Lucas Gibbs and was at evening meeting, which I thought a low time though some lively testimony.
2. Was their Quarterly Meeting. Some lively testimonies and some lively sentences in the time of business. Came off middling.
3. I met the Yearly Meeting Committee on Indian Affairs at 8 and we sat on that business till 10 at night. Though youth’s meeting was this day, I was at a Negro meeting. The French Friend and Sam C. Emlen were very lively, but after them the meeting was hurt by some others.
4. I got home.
5. About getting a pump log for Agnes Roberts.
6. Was Monthly Meeting and on the whole I think it was a favored time to me. Benjamin Reeve was there. I went to visit the widow Haines, widow of Simeon Haines and visited Noah Sharp who is very ill.
7. Was select meeting which some of us thought was a favored solid meeting.
8. Was First Day I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting which was a highly favored time.
9. Rainy weather.
10. At our meeting. Ann Willis was there.
11 and 12. About a top piece of a pump 9 feet long. Cleaning the well etc. 1=10=0 
13 and 14. About home.
15. Was First Day. I went to Newtown Meeting which was to me but a poor time though not a shut up time. The life and savor was wanting. A poor place. I fear the market and contention about roads spoils their meeting.
16. I went to the burial of old Benjamin Moor perhaps four score or more old. Abraham Grise and Elizabeth Collins was there and we had a meeting and a pretty deal was said amongst us and believe many pertinent sentences were communicated yet I thought it but a low poor time.
17. I went to our meeting, unhinged and poor. There was a great and grand wedding Nathan Newland and Mary Stokes. A mulatto woman Hannah Burrows appeared in a few words with good savor and life which was a help and I had a satisfactory time at last. The rest of this week about home rebuilding a wagon-house.
22. Was First Day at our meeting.
23. Getting timber for pumps etc.
24. At our meeting. A good favored time or I was mistake and I am satisfied others were too if it was not so. I set off towards Middletown Quarterly Meeting. Lodged at brother Joseph Warrinton’s.
25. Went to Middleton [Bucks] Quarterly Meeting with Lucas Gibbs. Got to their select meeting. A solid body of wise friends. Lodged at William Blakeys and had the company of John Simpson, Thomas [missing surname], Ruth Wormsley and cousin Hannah Thronton and very precious it was with some from Philadelphia.
26. Was Quarterly Meeting. A large number of weighty Friends and able ministers. I was pained with a fear that their state was represented too whole and full. Labored for relief of my own mind and got some.
27. Was their youth’s meeting which was very large and a favored time. Came homewards as far as brother Joseph Warrington’s. All well only got wet being overset in a fording place above the waist and [on the] 28[th] got home and found all well.
29. Was First Day. William Savery was at our meeting. It seemed to be a time of hard labor but William Savery labored through it very well.
30. About home getting firewood.
{1795-12}
1 of the Twelfth Month. At our meeting and a favored time it was. I thought I hardly ever seen such a silence cover the meeting before. I had a satisfactory time and a Methodist came in late, sat for a while and spoke very well. Seemed tender and loving.
<pb id="A0011522_045"/>
Made two pumps one for John Evans (last week) 22 feet long and one for John Haines 18 feet long, both all settled.
Twelfth Month, 1795, 2-3-4. About home.
5. I went to select meeting at Haddonfield. Something a little lively at last. I went home with my beloved friend Joshua Evans who is just returned from his long journey through New England to Montreal, Quebec and Nova Scotia with an olive leaf in his mouth or very good tidings and certificates from divers parts giving precious accounts of his acceptable service.
6. Was First Day. I was at Newtown Meeting. A hard place to labor but we got through pretty well.
[Right marginal note] I am more and more confirmed that their contention about roads and market has wounded and weakened them.
7. Was Quarterly Meeting at Haddonfield which was very large. Deborah Darby and Rebekah Young were there and a most highly favored time it was. I thought I hardly ever saw more of the crown of glory and diadem of beauty cover that meeting. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 28:5</note> 
8. I was unwell with a bad cold and could not go to our own preparative meeting.
9. About home.
10. I went to the burial of a very ancient Black woman but few attended. A poor low time to what some have been but not quite destitute.
11. Was our Monthly Meeting and an highly favored time it was. A true precious Gospel ministry flowed forth freely as it did at the Quarterly Meeting last. John Simpson, Martha Moon from Pennsylvania and Mary Newbold were there, most precious favored Gospel ministers in my apprehension, yet must conclude it a favor from the Lord through them to us. meeting held till they lit a candle to finish by and its holding so long hurt the service. Things got very flat and low like the pond drained dry.
12. Killing hogs. At our last Monthly Meeting a testimony against a worldly spirit was born in a remarkable manner concurring with the extracts which express that a worldly spirit was the radical or main cause of all the deviations amongst us.
13. Was First Day. At our meeting: middling so so.
14. Brother Aaron Wills was here I went with him and my son Joseph to see his place and other affairs.

24. I went to the burying ground at Moorestown to the burial of Rebekah Shute, of whom some tokens or room to hope. Ended well. Things seemed low with me though I believe some were favored.
25 and 26. About home getting wood etc.
27. Was First Day. Went to Evesham Meeting which was very large. A great many young people. I had the most open favored time I ever had at that place. meeting held late. Went see William Rogers and wife poorly.
29. At our meeting to good satisfaction. The Methodist minister was there again but he was silent.
[Left marginal note] Went with Job Cowperth and wife to E. Darnel’s on business and believe of some use.
[Left marginal note] Colt to S P.
<pb id="A0011522_046"/>
A few words of certain writer of no ordinary genius and observation: says that should a Christian be in his other affairs as he is in relation to his salvation the world would not endure him. He would pass for a very fool.
30. About home.
31. Brother Joseph Warrington and wife was here to see us and I went with them to see an ancient Friend, Ann Stokes.
{1796-01}

5. Was preparative meeting. First meeting came off very well, the other middling.
6. About home dressing out plow stuff.
7. Visited the school to good satisfaction.
8. Was Monthly Meeting. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, January 1796: "Report was made from the Preparative Meeting of Evesham that Abel Crispin hath been dealt with for the neglect of attending our Religious Meetings, copying after the vain fashions of dress and exercising in the Militia. John Hunt, John Collins, and Saml White are desired to visit him and report thereon to next Meeting."</note>  Joshua Evans, Claton Brown and Aaron Wills and Joseph Buzby were there. The forepart did very well but the latter part was a very poor distressing, sickening time.
9. Getting timber for plows etc. and mending boys’ shoes etc.
10. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Came off middling. Rather hard getting along. Joshua Evans was there but was silent. We dined together at Martha Allinson’s. Had a pretty little tendering time with the widow and children.
11. I went to the burial of my first cousin Abigail Matlack and had a favored solid time with the people of the house to good satisfaction. Then went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting in the afternoon. Got there just as they entered on business. Had peace and satisfaction in this day’s work.
Some thoughts on a part of meeting and some ministry some little time back and on the state of a meeting for discipline. There was the bell, but the pomegranate was wanting. <note resp="transcr"> Journal inserts "There were offerings and sacrifices, but salt was wanting," 272. Exodus 28:34 and 39:26.</note> 
See 1 of Corinthians 12 and 3 verse: No man can say Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost. 
And see Jeremiah 5 and 2, though they say the Lord liveth they swear falsely. 
Words and life are two things. Words without life are but like sounding brass and tinkling cymbals but with charity and life they are forcible and like apples of gold in pictures of silver. <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 13:1</note> 
See Exodus 20 and 25, If thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
And the Lord saw that the imagination of man’s heart was only evil continually, see Genesis 6 and 5 verse.
As to the state of some and the state of some religious affairs handled by them: the worldly spirit, it is to be feared, has of latter time gained the ascendancy. It seems the Devil has had an opportunity of taking many up into an high mountain and shewing them the glories of the world and promising them [if] they will worship him all shall be theirs* and is it not greatly to be feared that many have closed with the proposal? And are not such like children diverted and delighted in a toy shop, selling their birthright for a mess of pottage <note resp="transcr">Genesis 25:29-34</note>  and hewing to themselves broken cisterns? <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:13</note>  Has not the earth opened her mouth and swallowed many up who, in this day of prosperity and great opportunity of getting money, so, by being snared with the unlawful love of lawful things, rendered themselves unworthy of the master’s company [and] so become greatly weakened and wounded.
[Left marginal note]* See Luke 4 and 5 and 6 and see Matthew 13 and 44, 18 and 47. These were not like them. Read it.
12. Was our meeting and a favored time it was. I had satisfaction. Something of the owning of truth I thought.
<pb id="A0011522_047"/>
13 of the First Month, 1796. We went to the burial of Agnes Roberts widow of Enoch Roberts. I had a pretty good time at the house. Joshua Lippincott was like a father to me and truth seemed to have the dominion a while but outward formality prevailed again which to me was afflicting and distressing. The enemy got in, but yet unexpected I had something to say at the grave, but there was need of great weightiness to our balance such a company of outward formalities. The rest of this week about home at work at plow stuff getting wood etc.
17. Was First Day. A very stormy day. John Simpson and John Cox was at our meeting. A very full crowded meeting it was and he (Simpson) had on the whole an exceeding open favored time. John Simpson very earnestly proposed my going with him to Philadelphia to be at their select weekday and meeting for sufferings but my way did not seem to open to get along: difficulty leaving home.
18. Stormy, most winter like weather that we have had this season.
19. At our meeting and John Collins said I did very well but I thought it was not so well as several weekly meeting days past. He owned that we have had some favored meetings particular on weekday of latter time.
The rest of this week about home. Weather very cold and snowy. children all goes to school. I have enough to do and a distressed poor week I had of it. Gates of destruction, disgrace and ruin opened in full view. every way no peace, no quiet but I never seen the value of it more fully and clearly.
24. Was First Day. At our meeting, came off very well, no cause of complaint. This afternoon I went to see William Rogers, Jr., who has lost his reason, quite raving distracted. A dismal scene of sorrow and sore trial. I lodged at brother E. Evans.
25. I went with Joshua Lippincott and other Friends to a meeting John Simpson appointed at Long-a-Coming at the tavern amongst a people of not of our society chiefly. John Simpson had a great deal to say and the meeting ended pretty savory and well but not that life in dominion as at some times. I went with John Simpson to Enoch Evans to dine and there we had a sitting to profit I hope. Then we went to see William Rogers Jr who is no better. His reason seems quite gone.
26. At our meeting which was a favored healing time to me.
27 and 28. About home.
29. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Benjamin Sweet was there and I thought we had a pretty good meeting. It was their preparative meeting.
30. I went with John Collins and Samuel White to visit Abel Crispin with whom we had a solid favored time in clearing ourselves though there seemed no door of entrance in him. It was a satisfactory time to me, good pay for traveling through the snow on foot. A very cold day. 
31. Was First Day. At our meeting. No fault found nor no condemnation or dissatisfaction that could discover. I spent this afternoon with John Collins by ourselves.
{1796-02}
1 of the Second Month. About home.
2. Was our preparative meeting, better than time past.
3 and 4. About home.
5. Was Monthly Meeting. Joshua Evans and Elizabeth Collins were there but the service if there was any forepart fell to me and I haven’t discovered any body displeased with it nor left uneasy about it. This month better than several latterly.
6. I went to see William Lucas, [who was] in a low weak declining way. Had Nathan Smith’s company and help. We left him very tender and broken.
7. Was First Day. Nathan Smith and William Ashby came over with me and we were at Chester Lower Schoolhouse and a highly favored time it was. Truth was in dominion over all. This afternoon we had three settings in Friends families and one at Joseph Buds before we left.
8. About home.
9. At our meeting. Aaron Wills was there and he says it was a good meeting so I came off bravely. Still no birch. brother Aaron and I went 
<pb id="A0011522_048"/>
to see William Rogers.
10. Mending a pump for William Cox. Very snowy.
11. About making a cedar tub. Very rainy day.
12. Went to Samuel Lippincott’s to make a pump near Cropwell and went to that meeting and a most precious highly favored time we had. One of the best meetings I ever had.* O that I could ever walk worthy and consistent with it!
[Left marginal note] *I heard of divers who expressed their satisfaction with that meeting.
13. We finished Samuel Lippincott’s pump 21-6 long. This afternoon our dear esteemed Friends Deborah Darby and Rebekah Young from England had a meeting at Cropwell. Rebekah Wright also was with them. The house was full crowded and a precious highly favored time it was. The Gospel ministry flowed forth to the youth in a distinguished manner through these sweet instruments and the meeting ended in a sweet heavenly solemn quiet. 
I went with my brother Aaron Wills to Martha Allinson’s with these dear precious friends and there we had a choice season with a room full of friends where sweet counsel flowed forth to the youth and these worthies owned poor me as brother and one of them (R. Wright) when we parted called me brother, which was more than I expected or as I thought I deserved. I got home a little before midnight.
14. Was First Day. We went to the Schoolhouse Meeting appointed for the Black people and a favored good time it was. We had an Epistle from the convention of delegates [which] met at Philadelphia of the Abolition Society directed to the Black people. Read to them to satisfaction.
15. About home making a cedar tub for my daughter-in-law.
16. At our meeting. Not so satisfactory as some of later time.
17. Deborah Darby and Rebekah Young from Europe appointed a meeting at our meeting which was very full crowded and a highly favored time it was.
18. Was a very stormy day. I was at the Schoolhouse Meeting. Joshua Evans was there and I thought it was a pretty good meeting but some of our curious inspectors were not fully satisfied. Joshua had very close scraping work against a worldly spirit. Extortion he said was a lying sin etc. The rest of this week I was helping my son getting timber for his house, at Samuel Lippincott’s putting a pump in the cellar.
[Left marginal note] A little birch work
21. Was First Day. My wife and I went to Evesham Meeting with the Black people and had the Epistle from the convention read and a favored satisfactory time I believe it was in general. Hannah Burrows, the Black woman, spoke very well on various matters in the Epistle.
22. About home at work in the shop.
23. At our meeting. Came off very well. I believe the Methodist minister was here again but kept silent.
24-25-26. About home.
27. I went to Burlington with Lucas Gibbs. A rainy time. I was at their select meeting. Deborah Darby and Rebekah Young were there and most highly favored they were and a choice meeting it was. I went to my cousin Peter Ellis’s and was at Mansfield meeting.
28. On First Day I had a very open time to good satisfaction, a solid good meeting. Lodged at John Cox’s, Jr. Had a sweet time in the evening together and cousin Peter and I had one at our cousin Peter Harvey’s First Day after noon.
29. Was at their Quarterly Meeting where was a large number of solid Friends. The European women had most extensive weighty service and it was thought by some to be the most favored meeting they had ever seen there. Certainly thing are rising.
{1796-03}
1 of the Third Month. Got to our meeting which was a lively time and savory to satisfaction, sweet: some very good shots at Burlington and some misses.
[Left marginal note] But home to mend.
<pb id="A0011522_049"/>
2 of the Third Month 1796. About home till Seventh Day. My wife and I went to see my sister, Samuel Stokes and Elisha Hooton’s. I had a pretty good opportunity at their school amongst a large number of children who behaved well. I was mending Hooton’s pump to no purpose.
6. Was First Day at our meeting. I believe there was no cause of complaint. We spent the afternoon at John Collins middling well.
7. *A violent storm. Nearly if not quite as cold freezing weather as any we have had this winter yet the butterflies were seen before the week was out.
[Left marginal note] *I had an opportunity at Cropwell school pretty well. Did something at a pump for Samuel Lippincott and got some corn of Joseph Rogers.
8. Went to our preparative meeting in the sleigh. A pretty good meeting.
9 and 10. Very cold; snow on the ground but we made a pump for my brother Elisha Hooton 31 feet 6 inches long.
11. Went to our Monthly Meeting <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1796, notes: "The History of Friends in Ireland to John Hunt for the present month."</note>  and there was a great and choice shower of strangers. Benjamin Swet said her concern to visit Evesham Meeting in their families which was concurred with and there was a good degree of solemnity attended the meeting which I took to be one of the best tokens of the ownings of truth. I lodged with John Cox at William Rogers with a number of these strangers and we had in the evening a profitable sitting to comfort and edification. Much good council was communicated tending to sweet unity strength and harmony. John Cox and I had an opportunity with a young woman at William Rogers at passing.
12. Was at our select meeting which to me was a very dull time though John Cox had some service and there was some life at times.
13. Was First Day at our meeting and I think it was a time of high water more so than common. John Collins and all seemed well satisfied so I came off bravely.
14. About home.
15. A very warm day. At our meeting. Joshua Evans was there. Had close work and hard getting along for or with him and none at all for me.
16 and 17. Storm and a most violent wind blowed down abundance of fence and tore some building stack etc. very much. Some old men said they never seen the like.
18. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Elizabeth Collins was there. They had a meeting of conference on the extracts and on the whole it was a favored time lively and savory and the advice of the Yearly Meeting closely pressed home and many lively remarks on various subjects mentioned in the extracts.
19. Very cold. Chopping and splitting up rails etc.
Brother Aaron Wills and beloved John Cox Jr. came to see us and lodged, whose company was truly agreeable and comfortable.
20. Was First Day at our meeting. John Cox had a considerable deal to say but a door of entrance was more wanting than a door of utterance. Hardish getting along though I hope we came off pretty well and that the meeting was to profit.
21. About plow making. One for J. Stiles and one for Joseph Coles.
22. At our meeting. Not satisfactory.
23 and 24. About putting up fence which the hard wind blowed down.
25. At our select meeting but a lowish time though some life.
26. At Quarterly Meeting at Haddonfield. John Reeve had a great deal to say and the meeting for business middling though but low to what some have been. Lodged at James Kains.
<pb id="A0011522_050"/>
1796 26 Was Seventh Day. At select meeting at Philadelphia and a highly favored time it was. Deborah Darby, Rebekah Young and Martha Routh from Europe were there, most beautiful eminent dignified instruments. I attended all Thomas meetings till the conclusion which I thought were very changeable like the season. Some of them were most highly favored times as I ever seen even like a feast of fat things and wine of the kingdom of the lees well refined <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 25:6</note> . It was like a looking glass to me wherein I saw my own shortness littleness and poverty compared with many valiants. And some of these meetings were very hard poor and trying, acknowledged to be so by the Committee of Elders which agreed with my own sense of things. 
I had in company with Nathan Smith an opportunity with a large number of Black people who owned the Methodist Society to very good satisfaction. Whilst at town I had several pretty good sweet opportunities in private families, one at John Fields, brother A: Wills was there and several others. 
Meeting concluded on Third Day about one o’clock and a most precious conclusion it was. D. Darby and R. Young and William Savery took their leave of us in a most solemn manner, imparting most precious solid weighty pertinent counsel to ministers and elders worth treasuring up. And Samuel Emlen who is now going the 6[th] time to England on a religious visit in the 66 year of his age (and very weakly and infirm and very dim sighted) with divers others, to wit: Deborah and Rebekah Young now about to return home and William Savery is going to Europe and Phebe Speakman and Sarah Tolbert [from] Yearly Meeting: which makes four in all now bound for England, Ireland, Germany and some a prospect of visiting France I believe. I got home on Third Day evening the 29 and came home too soon. I ought to have stayed and attended a committee on Indian affairs.
30. I went to help move John Thorn to William Stogdon’s place the rest of this week. Stuck close to hard work fencing and getting rails etc.

18. Went to Elisha Hooton’s after hay.
19. At our meeting. George Matlack and S. Roberts were married. I had a pretty good open satisfactory time. The rest of this week I was pretty close confined to the plow. A poor man was killed with a kick of a fine stallion this week at Moorestown, supposed to be a little drunk. His name Thomas Morris. Left a wife and family of children very poor, though he was a very industrious man. The horse called Roebuck belonging to N. Middleton. A dismal crew there is at Moorestown. Remember John Stokes killed there of one of their fine horses but a few years ago, but they think no more of it than the life of a dog. The man work[ed] for<italic> </italic>Richard Smith. [notation] See 11 of Next Month: R.S. buried.

27. I went to market and several errands at town. I was pressingly desired to go to see a young woman on a singular occasion. Had an opportunity with her, Elizabeth. I was satisfied with the council I gave her (about marrying) and in her school and with her mother very ancient and recovering of a heavy spell of sickness together with Huson Langstoth’s widow and with two more young widows but all in the same house though in separate room. Then I went to see Thomas Scattergood’s wife who had lately received a letter from her husband who is in Ireland in which he sends his love to me and says he lately had a pleasant dream about me. Then I went to see William Savery who is just about to embark for Europe and had a very satisfactory edifying time with him for about two hours. Then went to see Samuel Emlen bound for England but had not much time with him, it growing very stormy. Wind high, a dismal time to cross the river, and rained hard.
My apprentice lad is free. No help but Benne. I am forced to stick close to the plow.
{1796-05}

The rest of this week at work amongst our corn, harrowing only. On Seventh Day was our select meeting at Haddonfield. Ebenezer Millier and John Reeve were there. I thought the waters seemed low but were raised by working of the pumps. As Barclay’s compares it: by putting a little water in a pump and working it, it brings up the rest and so I thought the meeting seemed pretty lively at last.
[Right marginal note] Forced to work hard and not very well and B[illegible].
[Left marginal note] I forgot I made a pump 9 feet long for A. Warrington's. All settled this week.
{1796-06}
5. Was First Day. See Jeremiah 31 and 34, And they shall teach no more everyman his brother, saying know the Lord, for they shall all know me from the least of them to the greatest of them etc. And see Hebrews 8 and 11, And they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother for all shall know me from the least to the greatest etc. 
And see Thomas Bevan's essay of primitive Christianity etc. page 25, But the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things necessary to salvation.
But the anointing which (by measure) ye have received of him (Christ the anointed and God without measure) abideth in you and ye need not that any teach you, but the same anointing teacheth you of all things necessary to salvation. And again we are told of a more sure word of prophecy unto which we should do well to take heed etc. So cease from man whose breath is in his nostrils etc.
I was at our meeting and an open favored satisfactory one it was to me though I was very poorly both before and after meeting yet quite forgot that I was unwell in meeting till a few minutes before it broke up. This afternoon I was exceeding poorly with a fever and great pain in my bones.
6. Was our Quarterly Meeting but I could not go. I was very unwell.

Jesse is a young man looks boyish but a great minister and great orator and had a great deal to say. This afternoon had a meeting at Cropwell in which Jesse was large in testimony. Dined at Joshua Lippincott’s.

30. My wife and I went to Evesham Meeting which was a time of favor to me and to general satisfaction or the people was very deceitful for they were very kind and inviting after meeting. A gathering healing time which I stood in great need of, for I had sore trials and was wounded.
{1796-07}

6 and 7. Reaping
8. Was our Monthly Meeting. To me it was a more lively satisfactory time than we have had [in] many months. Only one blur happened.
9. Reaping – I and my three sons only. Very closely. More I believe than an acre apiece.
10. Was First Day. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting at Chester. Benjamin Swett was there and I think I may say if I am not deceived that it was a lively highly favored time with me and this is one reason that I think I am not deceived, viz. it had a strengthening tendency and feeling increasing nearness towards the faithful and longing desire after their company with sweet calmness and increasing unity so I conclude it was a degree of that spirit accompanied us at that time which breathes peace on earth and good will amongst men.
11. Reaping in the morning. Benne and I finished and then went to the burial of Richard Smith. Seriousness, solidity, weightiness or deep thoughtfulness becoming the occasion, nor scarcely any attempt to come at it, though John Cox, Jr., was there. The time to me seemed lost. They took him to Burlington to bury.
12. Was our weekday meeting which was but middling. We have had a very dry time but this week very wet weather. I was about getting hay, sowing buckwheat etc. forced to work very hard.

<pb id="A0011522_054"/>
First Day afternoon. See Richard Claridge’s work page 65:
One fear hath continually attended me, namely of going before my guide and leader Christ Jesus. I bless the Lord, my heart is fixed in his blessed truth, and I have his comfortable presence with me and I am glad of the least ray of his heavenly light. O what great things he hath done for me, who hath redeemed my soul from death and my feet from falling and made his cup of love to overflow and with honey out of the rock hath satisfied me. Endless praises be ascribed to him for his mercy endureth forever. And still this word of heavenly council is with me: Wait; wait; for though God is faithful who hath promised and will perform his promise; yet the times and season he hath put in his own power and we are to wait to feel that power that raised Jesus from the dead.
There is life and safety in waiting in the stillness; for when the natural man or fleshly part is silenced then is the season for God to work; and as dear Mary Gulson said to me and I have experienced: when we are got into the true stillness the enemy cannot come to hurt, for he hath nothing to work upon when the flesh is silent.
This seems consonant with a remark I seen in the works of John Crook which as near as I remember was this: when the mind thinketh nothing and the body acteth nothing nor the soul craveth nothing contrary to the will of the Almighty then there is true peace and solid satisfaction.
8. At work amongst our corn.
9. Was at our meeting. Elizabeth Collins was there and most excellent service she had and I had a satisfactory lively time with which one of our elders showed very much pleased and asked me why I could not always do so well. I asked him why he said so. O, said he, the[y?] did it so well. Elizabeth’s testimony was much against a worldly spirit. Very close and pressing though in a tender manner.
10. About our corn.
11 and 12. Benne and me made a pump for Stacy Lippincott, 20 feet long, all settled. [Later addition] Stacy Lippincott was buried 8 of the Eighth Month 1798.
13. About home fencing.
14. Was First Day. My wife and I and youngest daughter went to Ancocas meeting and I thought with some others that we had a pretty good meeting. Dined at brother Aaron Wills’s. I went to see his son Joseph Busby’s to lodge where we enjoyed each other[’s] company in sweet communion and participation of the good things of the earth: pleasant fruits, pears, apples and choice watermillions [watermelons] and went to see our old neighbor Amos Buzby's wife and there we had a sitting which seemed to be an acceptable time to one at least. Came to brother Amos to lodge. There for want of more deep weightiness and watchfulness or giving way to reasoning [I] missed I fear one shot, however we enjoyed one another’s company in sweet unity and parted pretty clever and satisfactory and came next morning over to our meeting which was pretty well.
[17-18.] Fourth and Fifth [Day] of the week about home going to the mill etc.

29. We came over to Burlington Quarterly Meeting which was the largest that we ever knew there. The first sitting was but lowish, but the afternoon was a lively favored time. I came off with good satisfaction. There was a large number of great and worthy ministers: Peter Yarnall, John Simpson and many others, Martha Routh from Europe. A lively time shuteing [shooting] at Babylon, though for want of time some arrow might be spared [Jeremiah 50:14].

9. We came to our Monthly Meeting. Roger Dick had good and very good and acceptable service. It was the most lively satisfactory meeting we had had [in] a long time.
10. Was our select meeting. Joshua Evans was there and had good service. I believe it was a pretty good meeting, close searching work.
11. Was First Day. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting. Joshua Evans was there and I think it was a pretty good meeting. This afternoon Joshua Evans and I had a meeting at another schoolhouse belonging to people who do not profess with us which was a pretty lively time to satisfaction.

23. I went to town in company with Nathan Smith and lodge[d] with him.
24. Was select meeting, I think full a third larger than it was a few years ago and favored solid meeting it was. Much excellent council was communicated.
25. Was First Day. My brother-in-law Aaron Wills and I took our staffs and walked to Darby about 7 miles to their meeting. John Cox and John Smith overtook us and was there and I think we had a pretty good meeting. We dined with John Hunt of Darby whose wife is a very promising minister. Zachary Jess brought us up to town in his wagon. I attend the Yearly Meeting till the last sitting but one, having been closely engaged with my brethren and sisters either at select meeting or on committees from 8 in the morning till near 10 at night, 
<pb id="A0011522_056"/>
only giving time between meetings for a little refreshment.
Many of our sittings were highly favored seasons. Some of our ancient Friends said they thought they never seen a meeting better conducted. Some sittings were to favored times and some very dull and trying and even these were deeply instructing, letting me see there was no way to be right but to watch and to beg to labor or starve to resist the enemy, to fight or die. We had one most remarkable sitting one evening at John Pemberton’s widow’s house wherein Peter Yarnall was favored in prayer in a distinguished manner. Got home Seventh Day night with my wife and daughter Abigail who attended this Yearly Meeting with me. I thought I never seen more love nearness and sweetness before amongst Friends.
I was on a committee on a case brought from Rahway Quarterly [meeting] concerning a mulatto woman that requested to have a right amongst Friends, of whom Friends gave a very favorable account, but Friends could not unite in receiving her, on account of her color, so brought the case to this Yearly Meeting.
Martha Routh from Europe and Mary Mifflin, Ann Mifflin and with a considerable number of others, weighty wise solid women Friends, likewise a number of men Friends who were not of our committee attended and gave in their testimony in a solid manner and it was a heart tendering time even to tears. Jacob Lindley and Samuel Smith appeared on behalf of this cause and all unanimously united with John De Marsillac that there was never an discipline to prohibit from being received into membership on account of color or nation whatsoever and so we took in our report to the Yearly Meeting without that Monthly Meetings should be at liberty to receive all such where they were convinced of their sincerity without distinction of nation or color, with which the Yearly Meeting heartily united, and I think I [had] never seen any matter in which there was such a united feeling. Abraham Gibbins and Warner Mifflin were likewise strong and staunch in this cause. No opposition appeared. 
There was that which raised the testimony in this respect over all opposition, although the spirit of prejudice which had been imbibed on account of color had kept it back above twenty years within which time many or divers Black and mulatto people have requested to have a right amongst Friends but till now have been rejected and put by on account of their color.
About home this week gathering in our fall crop [of] buckwheat potatoes etc. but we attended our preparative meeting and Monthly Meeting which were attended with some degree of life though much is wanting and I fear in this time of peace and prosperity we are declining and growing dry and formal, though some dew.
[Left marginal note] First Day I [was] at our meeting middling so-so] 
At this Monthly Meeting one matter was very disagreeable to me. Friends, all but four: I.C., A. W., H.W., and me concluded to drop off [the] practice of women’s bringing their certificates themselves into the men’s meeting, which to me seemed going back, for I believe we went into it in the life when the meeting was in a growing state and now dropped it when it is quite other ways.
{1796-10}
9. Was First Day. My wife and oldest and youngest daughters and I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting which I think to me was the most open favored time I ever yet had. A high full flowing tide to general satisfaction I believe. We went to cousin A. Warrington’s to dine and stopped a while to see cousin H.W. and wife. All seemed pleasant? and well.
10. Gathering corn apples potatoes etc.

I set off with Nathan Smith, Aaron Wills, and Rueben Hilliard towards Morris’s River [Maurice River] with the full concurrence of our friends, after procuring a messenger to give notice of a meeting at Long-a-Coming. We visited three families: M. Allinson’s, Aaron Hain’s, and William Rogers Jr. which were tendering sweet opportunities to some I believe. Lodged at brother Enoch Evans. 8. Had a meeting at Long-a- coming. In the afternoon had a meeting at New Hopewell, which our elder thought both were favored meetings. Lodged at Jonathan Jones’s.

[Left marginal note] Cold and snow on the ground but we suffered none nor they lacked any thing.
12 of the Twelfth Month. I parted with my dear friends (I not having a prospect of going farther with them) in true and tender love and sympathy.
Went to Cape May and Egg Harbor. I had a serious long though not unpleasant day’s ride through the wilderness alone and not very well, about 32 miles. Lodged at Jonathan Jones’s where I parted with them satisfactorily.
13. Called to see several of my dear friends and got home this afternoon and through mercy found all very well and a sweetness, as I thought, more than honey sweet.
In the wilderness we rode through what is called Pismire town where there is heaps of sand like small hay cocks a few rods apart for miles together, built up by the pismires. I never seen or heard of the like on the continent of America.
14. Salting up pork etc. and getting some wood.
15–17. About home getting firewood and bored a top piece for a pump for Sarah Burroughs 9 feet long.
[Right marginal note] About this time extreme cold weather shuts up the river very quickly so as to cross on the ice.
18. Was First Day. Stormy a cold rain. I had had rough work with an easy lukewarm state like that of Laodicia and Moab etc. [Revelation 3:14-16] Notice was given that John Wigham from Europe was to be there Third Day next, at which time I did believe he would have the same sight and sense of things amongst us and so it came to pass, for he mentioned the same passage respecting the church of Laodicea, a loathful dry formalish state on which he had a great deal to say but in a hard complaining way.
19. I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting appointed by John Wigham and he had sound doctrine and solemn service and I thought there was a good degree of the owning of truth and savor of life attended at last. I went to dine with John Wigham and his companion at brother Joseph Warrington’s.
20. At our meeting favored as just above hinted.
21. About home extreme cold weather.
22. I took some of the children to Evesham meeting. John Wigham was there and had hard rough work with a dry formalish state. Said several time he did not expect to get much or any relief.
23 and 24. Extreme cold freezing weather.
25. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting and an highly favored strengthening time it was to me. I went to see Elizabeth Evans ill with the pleurisy.
26. Getting firewood.

{1797-01}
1 of the First Month, 1797. Was First Day. At our meeting, full crowded but a lowish time to me. 
Death is certain to all but the time when the place where and the manner how is a secret. But certain it is many and various are the ways by which people are taken away as various instances a few week past verify. 
Several three were drowned in the river since the late severe frost and a few week ago two men were burnt to death in a cabin at the cedar swamp. One’s name was Cox, a young man burnt partly almost all up, the other’s name was West, had a wife and several children, was burnt so bad that he died in a few days and suffered very much. And a few weeks ago just before I was at Morris’s River a house was burnt in the night and a Black woman and a Black child and a white child was burnt up at Morris’s River. And we have divers times been informed that a house was burnt in it 14 of the Ninth Month last- a man and his wife were killed with the thunder in bed eastward towards Prince town [Princeton]. The woman had a young child in her bosom and that was much burnt but like to recover.
[Right marginal note] Hugh David’s<italic> </italic>house burnt at Rahway and a girl burnt in it*
[Left marginal note] *Some houses burnt at Baltimore and Abraham Gibbons informs a house was burnt over Susquehanna published in the newspapers and several burnt in it and 40 houses burnt at York[illegible].
2. I went to mend a pump for Jacob Fowler and to settle some business with I. Thorn.
3. At our preparative meeting. I had some satisfaction.
4 and Fifth Day. Getting firewood.
6. Was our Monthly Meeting. Benjamin Swet and David Arne, hopeful young man, had good service and the forepart was very well and I had satisfaction but towards the last a matter was carried very contrary to my mind and I did not bear it as well as would have [been] best and more exemplary though I think I contended for the thing [which] was right and would have been best. E: Cor Cap [?]
8. Was First Day. My wife and oldest daughter and I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting and a precious highly favored time it was to me to good satisfaction. Daniel Arne and William Shaterthite Jr, hopeful young ministers, was there and had good service. I believe it was a favored time to many and a time of revival of hope and strength. After meeting the people were very loving inviting and pleasant. Indeed I thought we were like people a little overcome with wine. Nathan Smith was at our meeting and had a great deal to say and very close doctrine.*

9. About home getting firewood. Extreme severe frosty weather. Extract of part of a letter out of Isaac Pennington’s Letters, page 83, Yet one thing more, O mind it, it is more (as to the nature of the thing) to meet with one little touch of power upon a man[‘s] spirit to wrap him up into high enjoyments, or to enable him to speak great things of the mysteries of God’s kingdom, for it changes his heart more, it helps him on his journey more, it prepares his spirit more for the Lord, it adds to his growth more than the other. Yea the other will hurt him unless his spirit be poised by the Lord, and made able to bear it. But the still working of the power, which secretly melteth and changeth the mind renewing it (as it were insensibly) daily more into the image: that is the safe precious profitable ministration of life. O wait for it and be sensible of the tender mercy and goodness of the Lord as he leads you into and keeps you in it.
And see Mary Peasley or Neale rather * page 43, As I quietly rode along the Lord was pleased in mercy to break in upon my mind by his living presence and power and it became the language of my soul, <pb id="A0011522_060"/>
soul, speak Lord and thy servant will hear. [1 Samuel 3:9] After which many things were divinely opened to me wherein I greatly rejoiced and was thankful to the Lord my God. I then found a sudden but gentle rebuke and heard as it were a voice that said in the secret of my soul, the dispensations thou most delightest in are least pleasing to me and not so beneficial to thy soul, as that pure poverty of spirit, brokenness and contrition of heart, which brings into humility of mind and the reason why this is so little desired and so unpleasant to the creature is that it can have no part therein but is wholly excluded and set at naught; can discover no beauty or excellency in it and for this cause it is, that I will in no wise desire the offering of a broken and contrite spirit as it is most pure and without mixture of the creature. For whither there be prophecies, divine openings or revelation, joying or rejoicing in the Holy Ghost, gifts of healing or tongue of utterance, in all these self can rejoice and have a share, being obvious to it and bring it honor. Then said I, Lord, dispense to me what is most pleasing to thee and best for my soul, so long as my weak patience and faith can endure. And when I am ready to faint give me a little of the wine well refined on the lees that my soul may rejoice in the God of my salvation.

Chiefly about home this week getting firewood etc. Very severe cold weather and very dry, but rains latter part of the week and clear up moderate though the river remains froze up this several week so that they haul wood over the ice.
15. Was First Day at our meeting, which was a pretty solid quiet meeting though a time of silence as to me.
16. Getting firewood etc.
17. At our meeting and came off middling well I hope. After meeting Larps Gil and I went to Mount Holly to visit old Abraham Griffe near about 84 years of age, he being very poorly and sent word that he would be glad [if] I would come and see him. We found him mending and expressed a gladness to see us. We went to brother Aaron Wills to lodge.
18. Was at Ancocas meeting. It being work to get through: rough work brings good pay.
[Left marginal note] Crossed on the ice at T.B. Toys
[Right marginal note] Brother Aaron said he’s glad of my company his house and at his meeting.
The rest of this week about home getting wood etc.
22. Was First Day. My wife, two daughters and I went to Cropwell Meeting which but small, a snowy time but it was a good meeting. We went to see Elizabeth Evans who is yet poorly, confined to her room. Brother Enoch said he was glad of our company both at the meeting and at his house. We called to see one of my most near friends Joshua Lippincott. Got clear of a little matter there.
23. About home.
24. I heard of the death of William Lucas. At our meeting to good satisfaction. Lucas Gibbs and I visited their school which seemed to need it and I think we had a pretty good open time amongst the children, upwards of fifty.
25. I went to Philadelphia with Lucas Gibbs. Visited William Savery’s wife and Thomas Scattergood’s wife, their husbands being in Europe in truth’s service. We this evening visited a school of Black young women taught by the young women gratis, Friends of the city. About forty scholars. Nathan Smith was with us and we had an open favored time and it was a great satisfaction to see the excellent order and improvement of the school.
<pb id="A0011522_061"/>
26 of the First Month 1797 I was at their preparative meeting at High Street. John Wigham and Martha Routh and Abraham Gibins was there. The order described formerly by the Apostle was observed, viz. if any thing be revealed to him that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace so that all may speak and be edified. Friends gave way to one another and it was a good solid meeting to my satisfaction. 
This afternoon I visited Hannah Burrows in the hospital. She is quite deranged and lost her reason. It was affecting to see her in such a sorrowful condition and indeed many were the melancholy objects of sorrow and pity we saw there. We visited the alms house in which were many such like scenes of sorrow. These were houses of mourning indeed.
[Right marginal note] We visited a school taught by a Black woman and I never seen children read better or behave better.
This evening we visited a school of Black young men upwards of forty taught by young Friends of the city in which Nathan Smith and I had an open lively time amongst them. A good degree of solemn weight attended the opportunity. 
We lodged at Nathan Smith’s and a little before it was a printing office of one Brown. The inside of the house was chiefly burnt and it is said all his children and his wife were burnt to death and his life despaired of. It is said these were at the playhouse till 11 that night. He being much burnt and several of the apprentices were taken to the hospital in a doleful condition.
We went to their Monthly Meeting at Fourth Street and we had an open lively time and my Friends owned poor me. John Wigham and Abraham Gibbons invited me to go and dine with them which I accepted and went with them to John James* this afternoon I was taken very unwell and Lucas Gibbs and I came home.
[Left marginal note][*] [p]arted with [t]hese [F]riends [in feel]ing [bro]therly [u]nity
[28.] Seventh Day. I was very unwell. Could not keep up.
[Right marginal note] The river remains shut up. We crossed on the ice as on the highway but grows warm.
29. Was First Day. I got to our meeting which was an open satisfactory time.
30. I went to Joseph Roberts about a pump. Bored one log which proved rotten. Next day was at our meeting and it was a mortifying time to me. Could not get along. Maybe it is all for the better.
{1797-02}

9. About home forepart of the day.

Came off middling well though much wanting.
11. About home going to mill etc.
12. Was First Day. I had an inclination to go to the Schoolhouse Meeting but it so fell out I went to our own meeting and a favored time it was. It was a large meeting and many raw light spirits but I rather hope and believe they came under and the scoffer and gainsayer put to silence. We went to brother Joseph Warrington’s. His youngest son lay very ill.
13. About home. Brother Joseph Buzby and wife came to see us and tarried a night.
14 At our meeting and came off pretty well. Satisfied, approved of the elders.

17 and 18. About the pump, finished, 44 [feet] 6 [inches] long. Got home about break of day.
19. Was First Day. At our meeting which I thought ended solid and well. I thought I was delivered from the hand of the critic, harper etc., but find I was mistaken. Had a sad time with them.
<pb id="A0011522_062"/>
20th. Was Second Day. I went to make a pump for Joseph Roberts. Bored a bottom piece 22 feet. We had bored the top piece before, 8 feet long.

26. Was First Day. At our meeting. I think there was not much cause of complaint. I mended Joseph Matlack’s pump in the morning and then went to Burlington.
27. Quarterly Meeting. John Wigham and Martha Routh from Europe was there and many more valuable Friends were there and the testimony against several matters raised higher than I have seen them on behalf of women’s preaching and against the infringement intrusion interruption and imposition and disturbance of the young people running out and in. I thought on the whole it was a good solid meeting. Lodged at brother J. Warrington’s who is very poorly.
28. I got to our meeting and have felt no condemnation yet for what I did there, but felt satisfaction.
{1797-03}
1 of the Third Month 1797. I went to make a pump for Ruth Hegbe.
2. At work there.
3. Finished the pump 23 feet long all settled.
4. Went to see our brother Joseph Warrington’s who lies now very ill.
5. Was First Day. Lucas Gibbs and I visited two young men at Jacob Haines this morning whose lives have very lately been despaired of (had satisfaction). This day Martha Routh was there and a very great concourse of people there. Martha had a great deal to say and I thought the meeting ended very solid and well.
6. I went to a vendue. Very cold weather very high wind.
7. Was our preparative meeting and came off pretty well. Close scraping work.
8 and 9. Very cold and exceeding high wind. Went to see brother Joseph Warrington who yet lies very ill.
10. Was our Monthly Meeting. John Simpson was there and had most close searching extensive labor some things. The meeting for business was pretty well but I thought we had need [to] buy gold tried in the fire and which raiment to cover us with all so our nakedness may not appear [Revelation 3:18]. John Simpson requested an opportunity with me and so I went to lodge with him at William Snowdon’s.
11. We went to Upper Evesham monthly meeting where John had abundance to say and very close and edifying. Came off pretty well on the whole though life and clothing was wanting.
[Left marginal note] A stormy snowy time
12. Was first day. I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting which was not so large nor lively as some heretofore, though I hope not much cause of complaint. There was a door of utterance but a door of entrance was not so open as some heretofore.
13. About home sowing clover seed and at work at a pump for Joseph Burroughs.
14. At our meeting. John Simpson was there and a large number of people whose expectations I believe were raised high and was a hurt to the meeting. Heaviness and dullness seemed to cover many. Many seemed to me to be so doused in the spirit of the world that they seemed to me not in a state fit to hear, but John Simpson seemed qualified to labor with them and had a great deal to say no doubt suitable to their states but it was a poor time to me. I had worked too hard before meeting and a sad trying time I had just after.
14. About home. Like for a stormy weather.
15. I took Joseph Burrough’s pump home and finished it, 22 long all settled.
16. I went to work at a pump for David Clememts.

23 of the Third Month 1797. I went to our select meeting at Haddonfield. John Wiggan and Samuel Smith was there and good service they had. A solid good time to some. They said, O what a great privilege and high favor to be admitted into such company.
24. Was Quarterly Meeting. Samuel Smith and John Wiggan had great service. 
25. I went to select meeting at Philadelphia. I attended this meeting till the conclusion, most of which were owned with a powerful gospel ministry and much of it fell amongst the women: Mary Berry, Susannah Holinsworth, and Charity Cook from Carolina and divers others, precious sweet creatures. And O how humbling it was to see some, many, outrun me outgrow me and out do me. They shined like stars of the first magnitude. Third Day I attend[ed] a committee on Indian affairs where there appeared to me a right spirit, not a selfish spirit but a disinterested spirit of universal love charity and benevolence which will always be owned. I suppres[sed] the expression, then I went to their Monthly Meeting, stayed only the first sitting which was highly favored with a sweet living powerful ministry. Then I came home Third Day afternoon.
[29.] 4 [day]. about home.
[30.] Fifth Day. I went to Newtown Meeting. Nathan Smith I found there and a close searching time we had. I believe the states of the people were pertinently spoken to. Remember the apothecary’s glass: whatever different kinds of spirits of stuff were put in them it caused different colors to reflect from them and so it is with us, whither it be a spirit of love of spirit of malice or envy etc.
[31.] 6 [day.] About a plow for Jacob Kay. A rainy day.
{1797-04}
[1.] Seventh Day of the week. I went to Martha Allinson’s to mend her pump etc.
2 of the month and first of week. Our last spring meeting was like a banqueting house. I thought of the promise mentioned in the Revelations, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life that stands in the midst of the paradise of God, and I believe there were a number that experienced the promise fulfilled and were favored to eat of the hidden manna. See Revelations 2nd 7 Chapter and 14. I was at our meeting and I think I came off with satisfaction. I was alone at home, my wife and the children went to Haddonfield. Charity Cook and Susana Holinsworth were there and one of them had good service. They said the children got inoculated.
[3.] Second Day. About home splitting rails etc.
[4.] 3 [day]n Was our preparative meeting which I think was somewhat lively to me.
[Left marginal note] Very warm weather.
[5.] Fourth Day. About splitting rails.
[6.] Fifth Day. Do and I went to the burial of an old negro man, Pharo. There was a pretty many Black and white people and very raw and unthoughtful they were both at the house and at the grave. I found it hard work to come at anything or to call their attention to anything of thoughtfulness or seriousness becoming the occasion. Both whites and Blacks seemed rather disposed to get together and into conversation which is too common at burials. But I tried at it both at house and at the grave, have no cause to repent of it since. I hope rather got the advantage of that light unthoughtful spirit.
[7.] Sixth Day. Was our Monthly Meeting. Some unpleasant sensations and feelings under an apprehension of the active man’s part being predominant and so a partial spirit that can twist and turn things to suit the creaturely will and not deal with the rich as with the poor. I had rough hard work but some satisfaction. If ye secret accept persons he will surely reprove you, said Job to his friends <note resp="transcr">Job 13:10</note>  .
[8.] Seventh [Day]. About home a very stormy day.
9 of the Fourth Month. Was First Day. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting. William Wood was there and I think we had a good open favored meeting. One of our elders R.W. likewise seemed to be of the same mind.
10. About home.
11. I was at our meeting which was to some satisfaction. The rest of this week very busy hauling dung.
16. Was First Day. Very stormy. Confined at home. Children in the small pox and much favored.

18. Was a violent storm of snow nearly quite as much at one time as all the winter. Plowing this week. A few weeks ago a very warm and several thundershowers a lad killed in Pennsylvania with the lightening.
<pb id="A0011522_064"/>
23rd of the Fourth Month 1797. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting and I do believe it was a favored open solid good time. I thought it did me good all the week. Afterwards about home, very busy hauling out dung and plowing etc. Mended J.L. pump and put a moldboard to a plow for William Kain.
30th of the Fourth Month. Was First Day. At our meeting. Came off but middling as I thought. This afternoon James Barrit sent for me to come to see him, he being very ill, in great pain, and in danger as it seemed of losing the use of his limbs. Lucas Gibbs went with me to see him. He seemed under a very humbling condition and tender and acknowledged his negligence and deficiency in tending meetings.
{1797-05}
1st of the Fifth Month. About plowing and getting ready to plant etc.
2. Was our preparative meeting and as I was favored to get clear of the creaturely will. I came off with satisfaction and an increase of strength.
3 and 4. About home getting ready to plant.
5. Was Monthly Meeting. Answering queries I laid things rather closer than some could well bear and got my change which I did not bear as well as would have been best. I remember what my dear cousin William Hunt once told me, that it was as much as a little fellow’s life was worth to say a word.
6. Begun to plant corn.
7. Was First Day. I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting which was I believe to general satisfaction. A favored open time to me. The people seemed very pleasant and loving and inviting after meeting, something gathering.
8. About planting corn etc.

15. About home finishing planting.
16. At our meeting. Aaron Wills and Nathan Smith was there but was silence. I still continue to come off and get along with the countenance of my best friend.
[Left marginal note] Heard of the death of Joseph Kaighn and his sister and in a few days her husband Arthur Dolinson.
17 and 18. About home.
19. I was at Cropwell Meeting which was very small but it was to my satisfaction and comfort. Mended three pumps for J L: and J K.
21. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. A time hard labor and rough work with an indolent earthly spirit but got through pretty well at last. Yet several pretty pleasant and asked me home with them unexpectedly. A people many of whom should be as standard bearers are burying their talents in the earth  <note resp="transcr">Matthew 25:25</note> . Very industrious and rich in temporal but indolent and poor in spiritual things. I went to see a poor old woman at John Thorn’s who seemed to be near her end.
22. About home.
23. At our meeting which to me was a favored lively time.
24. About home.
25. We went to the burial of Hepsibah Matlack, a young woman who died with the consumption and a poor low dry shut up time it was. O what ups and downs perplexities and trials we have to met with. The enemy comes in like a flood. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 59:19</note>

{1797-06}
3 of the Fifth Month, Seventh [Day] of the week at our select meeting. John Reeve was there and had a great deal to say but it was a poor trying meeting to me. I was at the afternoon meeting which at last was to my satisfaction.
5. Was our Quarterly Meeting. In the first part I held back to much but in the meeting for business it was a favored lively time [to] me, strengthening and satisfactory. James Simpson was there and had good service.
6. I went with James Simpson to Newtown Meeting which was a favored open time to me and him and Hannah Griscom.
<pb id="A0011522_065"/>
7 and 8. About home.
9. Was our Monthly Meeting and I thought the forepart was a favored savory time and John Collins and I went into the women’s meeting and came off well but a matter was brought into the men’s meeting in which I thought I discovered a selfish partial spirit which very much disturbed me and destroyed my peace and satisfaction.
10. Tending corn.
11. Was First Day. My wife and I and two daughters went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting and an open highly favored time it was. meeting held later than common but was well, a satisfactory strengthening time. We went to see the widow Burr, very ill.
12. About home.
13. I went to the burial of widow Burr at Thomas Lippincott’s. She had a long time lost her speech with the palsy. The opportunity was much hurt by unseasonable gathering. They took her to Mount Holly to bury. I went to our meeting. A poor time I believe it was. The rest of this week about our corn etc.
18th. Was First Day. A very rainy morning. I went to Vincent Town meeting and had my esteemed friend Joshua Lippincott for companion. It was but a low time of hard labor but growed better towards the last. Joshua seemed to think we came off pretty well. Some were tendered and seemed kind. After meeting we went to see Abraham Kinsey who say he has been tapped thirteen times for the dropsy. I satisfaction in the visit.

20. At our meeting. A favored satisfactory time to me. The rest of this week about tending corn etc. Peter Yarnall and his wife came to see us.
25. Was First Day. Cousin Peter was raised in great eminence, a solid meeting. This afternoon I appointed a meeting at the Lower Schoolhouse. Peter and wife attended and Peter was very large in the ministry and a solemn quiet attended at last. And this is the chief we can say nowadays, but formerly they had to say at some of their meetings, numbers were added to the church etc. Is not the time come [which] Christopher Love prophesied of when he said the land should be blessed with mild governors? And so it is, comparable to what they were in ages and nations past: powerful preachers and dull hearers. Good sermons should be as music to a sleepy man. Many were overwhelmed with drowsiness whilst he was powerfully preaching yet I have a hope it will be as bread cast on the waters and found after many days  <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 11:1</note> .
26. About home.
27. At our meeting. Somewhat animating, J.C. says, though a thundershower somewhat unsettled the meeting. 
About home tending corn, laying barn floor, reaping wheat etc. the rest of week.
{1797-07}
2nd of the Seventh Month was First Day. I went to Ancocas meeting. Lucas Gibbs was with me. The meeting was but low, though some thought it was pretty well visited: cousin Samuel Wills and brother J Buzby. I seen where we might have done much better.
This week we were reaping and getting in grain in fine harvest. Attended preparative which was pretty lively and satisfying. And Monthly Meeting this week was pretty well forepart, but a matter brought in brought death and confusion, so did not end so savory as the fore and middle part was.
<pb id="A0011522_066"/>

11. At our meeting. Something lively storing after a close combat with a dull heavy spirit. The rest of this week about hay etc.

24. About home.
25. At our meeting. I think our weekday meeting have been more lively of late to me and satisfactory. 
The rest of this week about home till Sixth Day I was at Cropwell Meeting. Joseph Clerk and Stephen Grellett, a French man, was there and it was a favored time to good satisfaction.
26. About home.
30. Was First Day. I went with Joshua Lippincott, Joseph Clerk, and Stephen Grellett to New Hopewell. A small meeting in the pines and a tendering solid good meeting it was. A good degree of the savor of life attended till last, though the meeting held two hours and a half the people seemed not wiling to break up. Stephen Grellett had good service. We had a sitting with a very ancient friend A Hooton on our way home; a satisfactory good day’s work.
31. About home plowing and sowing buckwheat, rye, and grass seed.
{1797-08}
1 of the Eighth Month. At our meeting R. Roberts was favored with a sweet little testimony and what shall I say of myself? I don’t wish to recall it but I believe suffered loss by putting off too long. The rest of this week about home. Abundance of rain this week. Seventh Day I went to J. Borton’s mill for some boards and mended J.L. pump.
6th. Was First Day. At our meeting. Had like to have put off quite out of season but had a sweet opportunity to right. Good satisfaction at last.
7. I was at Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting. Came off pretty well. I was ready to think I should get some physic as well as food with them, but I came off without physic and was kindly received by my friends.
8. Was their youth’s meeting which was but low, though many had something to do and myself amongst the rest come of pretty well. This afternoon was a meeting for the Black people which was but a low laborious time, though several lively testimonies were exhibited and I come off pretty well, then came home late at night.
9th. About home.
10. Mending a pump for John Bishop etc. When at town James Cressen shewed me a suit of clothes his grandfather had that had been made by the cannibal Indians when he, Robert Barrows and others were shipwrecked on the coast of Florida and cast amongst them Indians. This suit of clothes was a little piece of plaited work made of a kind of grass just big enough to cover his private. And John Parrish shewed me two letters, one of George Fox’s and the other of William Penn’s own hand writing [which] by the dates were 100 and 8 years old. <note resp="transcr">Cresson was one of several people shipwrecked in the Florida coast in the 1690s. The story of their ordeal was told in Jonathan Dickinson, God Protecting Providence, first published in 1699 and reprinted numerous times.</note>  
The rest of this week about home till Seventh Day. Bene and I went to John Barton’s to make a pump 21 feet long, it being ready sawed and with their help we finished and came home very late and very dark. Got home about 11 at night.
I had like to forget our Monthly Meeting the 11 of last month. John Cox, Elizabeth Kerling, William Saterthite and Sarah Pope were there and a lively time it was. Many very pertinent lively remarks were made.
13. My wife and I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting which seemed very low at first but ended lively savory and well. This afternoon we had a meeting for the Black people which was but low. Very few attended. We had the epistle from the convention read to them and many remarks made endeavoring to force the pertinent advice therein.
<pb id="A0011522_067"/>
14th of the Eighth Month, 1797. About home.
16. At our meeting which was to me satisfactory.
17. About splicing a pump for brother Joseph Warrington, 10 feet long all settled, and I helped my son Joseph some about his barn and went to see poor Charles Conrows who lies much afllicted with swel[l]ings [and] ulcers. 6 great running sores so that he cannot well sit nor lie, but on one side in one posture.
18. I was at Cropwell Meeting which seemed very low and small but it ended well.
19. I went to look [for] timber for a pump for Phillip Mintle, very poorly with a bad cold.
20. Was First Day. At our meeting which was but a poor time to me. Hard getting along.
21. At work in the meadows cutting briars etc.
22. At our meeting which was but small and dull forepart but I waded through and it ended to my sweet satisfaction, though I had close work. An owing healing time. About two week past there has been a great alarm at Philadelphia, the yellow fever spreading in the lower parts of the town (Penns Street and Pine Street) so that many fled and have left the city and the shops and stores again shut up.
The rest of this week at work about home on the farm.
27. Was First Day. I went to Evesham Meeting which was at first but low and dull but it growed better and ended very well and to my satisfaction. A pretty open time. This afternoon I had (with the approbation of the Monthly Meeting) a meeting with the Black people, which upon the whole I believe was to general satisfaction. We had the epistle from the Convention of Delegates of the Abolition Society read by paragraphs and many remarks made thereon tending to impress and enforce the pertinent advice therein contained. This evening I went in company with Lucas Gibbs to my brother Aaron Wills’s to lodge, where we found a company of choice Friends: our cousin Peter Yarnall and his wife and others.
28. We went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting which was very large and many choice Friends there. It was a good solid meeting, an owning time to me in the time of business. A committee being appointed at this meeting to consider what could be done to prevent the meeting being disturbed by the irreverent conduct of young people running in and out in the time of business brought in their report and it was with great unanimity concluded that in future the men and women should meet in their different apartments like the Yearly Meeting and that young people that would not be advised and conduct [themselves] orderly should not be admitted to sit in these meetings. All this I have had a prospect of some years past.
[29.] Third Day morning I had a sitting in Lucas Gibbs's family and one in Benjamin Charetons and one at a school to pretty good satisfaction till just at last a little life arose and I had some relief. We hear that the yellow fever increases and rages in the city of Philadelphia and it is said near half the inhabitants fled into the country, divers of which were at this meeting on Second Day morning. I got of my brother A. Wills the precious Journal of Job Scott and read it through by Sixth Day morning and then finished a top piece of a pump for David Davis, 18 foot, all settled.
{1797-09}
[2.] Seventh Day. Was our select meeting at Moorestown which was on the whole pretty lively and well. Heard of the death of Josiah Gaskill.* He was one that in more early life seemed to promise fair to make a very useful member in society, but got into the business of distilling and much into the cumbering business of this world and much withered as to the life in religion. So it is, one taken from his farm and another from his merchandise.
[Left marginal note] *It is said he died of the yellow fever.
3rd of the Ninth Month. Was First Day at our meeting which was uncommonly large. Many there who had fled from town. The meeting I hope was pretty well.
4. Sowing wheat.
5. Preparative Meeting, middling well.
6 and 7. Seeding etc. I had a meeting at Haddonfield last First Day afternoon and a poor time it was.
<pb id="A0011522_068"/>
9th of the Ninth Month, 1797. Was our monthly meeting which was one of the best we have had a long time. A solemn sweet satisfactory time.
9. About sowing and I mended Jacob Key’s pump.
10. Was First Day. I went [to] the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting. One of the most open meetings I ever had and I believe to general good satisfaction.
11. Seeding.
12. At our meeting, middling well I hope.
13. Seeding.
14 and 15. Made a pump for Rhebuin Bradock, 19 feet 4 inches long, settled even.
16. Seeding etc.
17. Was First Day. At our meeting but middling.
18. Rainy.
19. Charity Cook from South Carolina was there and John Cox and Lydia Hoskins and an open solid time it was. They had good service.
20. My son Joseph and [I] made a top piece for a pump 14 feet 6 inches long for Thomas Marshall, all settled.
21. Was our select meeting at Haddonfield. John Simpson, Charity Cook and divers other strangers: Rebekah Wright and others, were there. I thought it seemed like very hard work getting along this afternoon. We had a meeting with the Black people which was an open favored time. I had long thought of a meeting for them at this time and place and now obtained it to satisfaction, though the service of the meeting fell to the strangers.
22. Was Quarterly Meeting. John Simpson, Charity Cook, and Lydia Hoskins had good service in the afternoon. On business we had some pretty lively remarks on the state of things.
23. I went to select meeting at Philadelphia which was but about one quarter as large as usual on account of the pestilential fever then prevailing, of which by accounts from fifteen to twenty have died a day latterly. But this day they say twenty-eight and it is said more than one half, some say three-fourths, of the people of the city are removed into the country. Yet the town and streets and market place was pretty full of people stirring about and seemed not at all alarmed, so as to be perceived. Our meeting was a solid open favored time except at last the subject of removing the place of holding the Yearly Meeting was moved, in which there was nothing concluded on after much being said. I came home late. 
24 of the Ninth Month 1797. Was First Day. I was at our meeting which was very large and I hope ended pretty solid savory and well.
25. I went down to our Yearly Meeting in company with John Collins, Robert French, and Rebekah Cowperthwaite. I attended this Yearly Meeting till the conclusion, which was on Sixth Day about 11 o’clock. Some sittings the forepart of the week I was dipped, stripped and baptized into death and poverty, but some of them were highly favored solemn comforting strengthening edifying heavenly seasons, especially at the conclusion. I think I never seen Friends part in such a tender solid affectionate loving manner before. And although I was engaged on committees, often from eight in the morning till nine at night and sometimes later, I had several satisfactory sittings in private families to good satisfaction, Reuben Hillion with me once and Isaac Martin another time. We seemed to have oftentimes scarce time to take a little refreshment between adjournments. There was much weighty business came before this meeting and Friends were favored with ability to attend to it and go through it with propriety, clearness and demonstreration [sic]. I thought I was loaded with a large share of the business, being nominated on every committee I think except two or three viz: on the treasurers accounts and on the epistles. Some
<pb id="A0011522_069"/>
Some committees were entrusted with very weighty matters, to wit an address being prepared to present to the congress on account of the sufferings of the Black people, 130 [John Hunt's Journal gives "one hundred and thirty four" (276).] of them having been taken up and sold for slaves from their nearest connections after they had been set free by Friends, which is yet to be attended to by us. Appointed to present it when the congress meets which is expected in the Eleventh Month next.
I came home on foot Sixth Day afternoon. Very warm and although the yellow fever still continued to rage in the lower parts of the town and in some few places, over most parts of the town Friends seemed preserved in the quiet and not much alarmed, though from the best accounts from fifteen to twenty and some days near thirty died a day.
[Right marginal note] Not one that we hear of caught the fever that attended this Yearly Meeting but in 1793 divers caught the yellow fever and died with it.
{1797-10}
1 of the Tenth Month 1797. Was First Day. A very stormy day. Our meeting was but small though to me it was satisfactory, a degree of life and savor.

It made me think of the man George Fox mentions, how he set [indecipherable] again etc. The meeting at Newtown was an open good meeting. We went to serve Ann Burrough’s with a minute of disunion for her going out in marriage. I had satisfaction in this day’s work.
[Right marginal note in a different hand] Ann Burrough might have said J. H. was humbled when he came to bring her testification etc.

[Right marginal note] Narrowly escaped being badly hurt with a fall of the wagon.

24. At our meeting. It was a pretty good time to satisfaction. The rest of this week about getting in corn, only on Fourth Day I helped Joseph raise his barn.
29. Was First Day. At our meeting, no satisfaction. It seemed not a day for me to bear tiding though I thought others were favored and the meeting ended pretty savory and well. The ministers and elders had a sitting.
30. About home.
31st. At our meeting. Had good satisfaction and the approbation of our leading man this time.
{1797-11}
1 and 2. About putting up board fence. A most sore trying wounding time. It seemed as if Satan was let loose to buffet me and prevail. I seemed within on[e] step of the gate of confusion and reproach ruin and disgrace, but the black cloud went off.
<pb id="A0011522_070"/>
4 of the Eleventh Month, 1797, Sixth [Day] of the week. Cousin Peter Yarnall and his companion John Spencer came to lodge with us and went to our select meeting Seventh Day. Peter had a most precious sweet tendering time with us. He appeared in prayer.

25. Benne and I bored Rogers’s pump, 29 feet long and I visited Cropwell School. Spent about one hour in it to good satisfaction, so the week ended well though I had one close trial which I was favored to stand better than common.
26. Was First Day at our meeting. Sort of middling. Did not please myself nor get much satisfaction though I hope not much cause of complaint.
[Right marginal note] I forgot to put it in its place: Last 4 Day [22.] I went to see Samuel Roberts daughter Lydia who died whilst I was there, about 13 or 14 years of age. Fifth Day [23] we were at the burial. A very stormy day. I think it was a pretty solid good time.

Seventh Day 2 of the Twelfth Month. Was our select meeting at Haddonfield Nathan Smith was there and Joshua Evans now returned after fourteen months absence on a visit to Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Genesee country and Redstone and gave a satisfactory account of his journey.
Our meeting seemed very low forepart, but life arose and it ended to good satisfaction.
3. I wanted much to go to see my near and dear friend Joshua Evans but it being stormy I gave it out. Was First Day. My mind was to go to Newtown and to get with Joshua Evans but contrary winds or something prevented. I was torn all to pieces and undone. Went to our meeting, a poor time to me though some opening. William Wood, newly come, a schoolmaster, spoke very well.
4. Was Quarterly Meeting but I could not go there, which was, as I then thought, against me. But I don’t know what left for me.
<pb id="A0011522_071"/>
Received intelligence of the death of my sister’s son Joshua Evans Jr and I went to the burial. He perished with Anonias Gatit on the bay at Egg Harbor. They were found dead in a boat. Joshua was brought up to Evesham. I was much alone. All the most solid friends gone to Quarterly Meeting. Met at Samuel Evans', a very dark spot or neighborhood and, as I thought, a dark spirited raw company to deal with, but they behaved solid and well and I had an open favored time with them. This night after a nap of sleep I thought on looking over the day I could adopt the language of the prophet viz. How precious are thy thoughts unto me O God and how great are the sum of them; if I should count they are more than the sands of the sea, when I awake I am still with thee . <note resp="transcr">Psalms 139: 17-18.</note>  Thoughts did flow in a wonderful manner. I thought if they had come so when I was at the burial I could have done much better than I did so. It is true there is that that scattereth and yet increaseth. I thought I experienced the wellspring of wisdom to be a flowing brook indeed. Just after a time when I was ready to say with the prophet woe is me for I am undone because etc. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 6:5</note> .
4th. This was the day of our Quarterly Meeting.
5 of the Twelfth Month, 1797. At our preparative meeting pretty lively; but one Miss.
6 and 7. About home getting firewood. Very cold freezing weather.
8. Was our Monthly Meeting. Nathan Smith was there and a scrapeing time he had. A pretty lively close scrapeing time it was.
9. Mending children’s shoes etc.
10. Was First Day we went to Cropwell Meeting came off prettily well I hope. 
11. I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. Nathan Smith was there. We had some pretty close work but things seemed low.

12. Went to our meeting and a favored strengthening time it was.
13. I went to make a pump for Nathaniel Barton.

15. Finished Barton’s pump, 37 feet long, not all settled.
16. Killing our hogs. Much warmer this week and rainy.
17. Was First Day. I went to the burial of Micajah Wills. He had been a magistrate and preserved a good name to old age. There was a vast concourse of people but a great want of stillness and although they behaved middling well solidity and weightiness and deep thoughtfulness was much wanting. I had not satisfaction. It was a mortifying time to me both at the grave and at the house.
18. My wife and I attended a committee at Evesham on the extracts. Got along to some advantage I hope although life and true zeal was wanting. Benjamin Reeve appointed a meeting there which I thought was but a low dull time, although he spoke largely and very well. Good sermons seems to be like music to a sleep[ing] man – they come before thee as the people cometh and set before thee as my people but return each one to his covetousness etc. <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:31</note>  Taken up with worldly affairs – about them they are lively and bright enough.
19. Benjamin Reeve was at our meeting which I thought was some better. He spoke very well but at these two last meetings I was shut up, could not get over the mortifying time on First Day although some were well pleased.

<pb id="A0011522_072"/>
{1798-01}
1 of first Month 1798. Went to Burlington Monthly Meeting which was a lively favored time. Left friend with sweetness and satisfaction.
2. At our preparative meeting. Joshua Evans was there and a very close scraping testimony he had against a worldly spirit: after which this revived with me, if ye be without chastisement then are ye bastards and not sons. And no chastisement for the present is joyous but grievous, but afterwards yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness or repentance. And again when the great master found the temple defiled he made himself a whip of small cords and drove out the buyers and sellers and overset the tables of the money changers and seats of them that sold doves [John 2:15]. And this seemed to be his, J. Evans, business this day. He promised me a visit but passed by the other road.
3 and 4. Getting firewood.
5. Was our Monthly Meeting which was pretty lively and well on the whole. Elizabeth Collins had good service.

16. At our meeting and a choice good healing one it was.
17. I went to mend Joshua Lippincott’s pump and went with him to see Samuel Evans and Isaac Andrews both very sick and stopped to see two other families. In one we were very favored I believe with a degree of the dew of [Mount] Hermon <note resp="transcr">Psalm 133:3</note> .
18. Mending children’s shoes etc.
19. I went to Philadelphia.
20. I met a committee on Indian affairs. I thought a degree of life attended the labor. This evening I with some other friends had an opportunity with an Indian king or one of their chiefs, his queen and one of his attendants. They say they come 600 mile and live beyond Detroit. An interpreter Isaac Zane was with them and interpreted for us. He says he was taken by the Indians when about 9 years old and has lived with the Indians 43 years or thereabouts. The opportunity was much to my satisfaction.
[Left marginal note] This Isaac Zane has got an Indian wife and seven children.
21. I was at Market Street meeting, a low time. The meeting hurt by unseasonable gathering. N.S. and A.H. had some service but I fell under discouragement.

2. I went to take Abbe to the ferry with her marketing etc. and got back and went to Cropwell Meeting and a favored time it was to me. Joshua Evans was there but was silent. After meeting had some service at the widow Burroughs’s I hope.

The meeting for business middling so-so.
10. About home. Had an opportunity with Isaac Buzby from Morris’s River. He brought an acknowledgment. See the account back of my being there about a year ago at Morris’s River.

13. At our meeting but middling.
14. Very stormy. A great snow fell. I was turning pump boxes etc.
15. I went with my wife to Evesham meeting. John Roberts Jr. and Esther Evans were married. The meeting was very poor and low forepart but it ended pretty well. I thought it was cause of thankfulness that some victory was gained over a light spirit commonly too prevalent at weddings and becoming solidly prevalent in the room thereof.
16 and 17. I went to make a pump 19 feet long for Josiah Lippincott. Finished it, all settled. Very cold weather and a large snow on the ground.
18. Was First Day at our meeting. Middling well, not like some times, chiefly to a young woman from Philadelphia, Rebecca Archer, who did beautiful. It seems to me the testimony is rising amongst the females. Last meeting for business I think things were low, a mortifying time.
20. At our meeting. Quite silent. I don’t know that was best to me.
21. I went to Samuel Davis about a pump.
[Right marginal note] This week I was with I.R., L.Y. and R.C. visiting several families of Black people to satisfaction.

{1798-03}

<pb id="A0011522_074"/>
3rd of the Third Month, Seventh [Day] of the week 1798. Was at our select meeting at Moorestown. Elizabeth Collins and her husband were there. I thought it but a low rubbing time. Dull getting along though Elizabeth Collins had some pretty little service at last and the meeting ended pretty sweet and I thought with a degree of the savor of life.
4th. Was First [Day]. At our meeting. A low suffering time forepart but at last was crowned with life. I.C. says it was a solemn time. O what a favor yet continued to us and me in particular. Joshua Evans came and lodged with us which was very agreeable and satisfactory.
5. At our meeting a very great concourse of people. John Simpson was there the meeting was low at first but John was raised in great eminence. I think I never heard him preach better. He seemed to hit upon and touch of every state and class. I went to brother Enoch Evans with John Simpson and this Evening we had a satisfactory solid time in the family. John and Enoch set of to Egg Harbor.
6. I came home and stopped to see Job Lippincott who many years ago had one arm cut off and a few days ago broke the other and I think had a pretty clever opportunity with him.
7. About home.
9. was our Monthly Meeting. Joshua Evans and Deborah Basit and Jane Sharp were there. Joshua had close scraping work, hinted very hard of a day of very close trials as his belief was approaching. Deborah and Jane had precious sweet service. Deborah is a poor afflicted creature nearly blind and so disabled with the rheumatism that she can scarcely walk across the house and is mostly carried and put in the wagon but I think she is well worthy carrying. 
10. About home splitting rails etc. Joseph Burroughs was here.
11. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting which was pretty well and satisfactory. I went to see Joseph Morgan who has had a spell of sickness. Relieved my mind. Was weather bound and lodged at Thomas Lippincott’s, had a sitting in the evening.
12. Splitting rails.
13. At our meeting. Thomas Rakestraw and Mary Lippincott was married. It was but a so-so indifferent middling time.
14. About splitting rails.
15. I went to the burial of Hannah Evans widows, an ancient woman who died at her son in law, Joseph Venbles. A poor place it appeared to be both in a temporal and spiritual sense, however I had a pretty satisfactory time with them and it was satisfactory to discover some victory gained over a light unthoughtful unconcerned spirit.
16 and 17. Splitting rails.
18. Was First Day at our meeting and came off well satisfied. A great favor to come of with any degree of reputation. I think there was something quitting gathering solemn and savory at last.
19. About home. Rainy. 
20. At our meeting. John Cox Jr. was there and had a hard laborious time with a worldly spirit but did bravely.
21. Very stormy. At work in the shop at some plows for Joseph Burroughs.
22. Went to Haddonfield select meeting. Had some close work with a spirit that would seemingly conclude all is well with us. Come off pretty well I hope.
23. Was Quarterly Meeting. Some seem to think there was a good degree of solemnity. John Reeve had a great deal to say. I went with brother Aaron Wills and lodged at Thomas Rogers’s.
24. Seventh Day. We went to select meeting at town and a solemn favored time it was. Mary Price from England was there, an ancient woman who had been marvelously delivered on sea, the vessel being so leaky that after being kept up by pumping and the hand all wearied out, another vessel heaved in sight to whom they made signals of distress and quitted their leaky vessel and got on to the other and their vessel sunk in a few minutes after. She on her knees, gave thanks for her deliverance on the wharf in the rain at Philadelphia which was put in the news.
25. Was First Day. I attended the meetings in town till Third Day night. Some of these meetings to me were trying striping times. Many there were like looking glasses to me. They outgrow me, outrun me, and out do me, though some meetings were tendering times and at some I had a share with my brethren in the ministry to satisfaction.
<pb id="A0011522_075"/>
[28.] I had a sweet opportunity with a society of thirty-six young women that have associated together to extend a care towards the poor of all description, nations, and colors. Mary Pryor from England was there and William Jackson and Jesse Kersey. There was a precious feeling among them and many very pertinent remarks were made to them and I had several sittings in families I hope to profit. Got home Third Day evening.
[29.] 4 and Fifth Day. About home.
[30.] Sixth Day. I went to town again to attend the Monthly Meeting with a committee of the Yearly Meeting, I hope to profit.
[31.] Seventh Day. Getting firewood and splitting rails.
{1798-04}
1 of the Fourth Month 1798 and first of the week. At our meeting. Elizabeth Kerling and Mary West was there and they had good service though I think the laborers of late have hard work with us. I dined with these friends at Lucas Gibbs and we had a pretty opportunity in the family then I went with two others to visit Caleb Borton under dealing to little satisfaction. [Later insertion] 26th Eighth Month Mary West was buried.
2. Very stormy.
3. At our meeting. Got along middling. A spirit of ease too prevalent. Benne and I went to brother J. Warrington’s to lodge. Still very stormy.
4. We went to make a pump for John Erl at the toll bridge.
5. We finished it, 16 [feet] long, all settled.
6. Was our Monthly Meeting. Joshua Evans [spoke] and had good service though close work. The meeting on the whole was pretty well.
7. I went to Upper Evesham Monthly Meeting which was a satisfactory time to me.
8. Was First Day at our meeting. A hard time getting along.
9. About home.
10. At our meeting. I think our meetings are not as well as some weeks ago. The rest of this week hauling our dung etc.
15. Was First Day. Went to Evesham Meeting and a poor time it was, hard getting along.
16. At work at home.
17. At our meeting. Very poor low times. Remarkable cold weather. A considerable snow and freezes so as to make great icicles like winter.
[Right marginal note] Yet thunder shower before the week out.
17 and 18. Hauling out dung.
19. Preparing for market. Abbe and Benne went.
20. I went to Andrew Crockit’s to finish a pump. The new top piece was 12 feet long. Four dollars due to me. A very heavy thundershower.
21. About plantation work.
22. Was First Day. I wanted to got to Cropwell but was crossed in my inclination and went to Moorestown and a poor time had of it. Third Day meeting was likewise a very poor shut up time. I fear the life of our meeting is somehow wounded. Search for the cause. On First Day I was at Evesham Meeting and a healing favored time it was. The rest of this week plowing and getting ready to plant.
29. Was First Day I went in company with Stephen Grellett and Joseph Clerk to New Hopewell meeting which was but small and forepart hard getting along but growed better and I thought ended very well. Stephen had good service I believe.
30. Plowing and getting ready to plant.
{1798-05}
1st of the Fifth Month. At our meeting. Sort of mixture hits and misses. Did not keep hold steadily of the clew of life.
Next day J.C. and his wife came to see us for the better I hope. The rest of this week plowing and getting ready to plant.
6 of the Fifth Month. First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. Peter Andrews and Samuel Townsend was there. Some times things went on pretty well and some times far from it. Planting.
13. Was First Day. We went to Evesham meeting. Elias Hicks and his companion Joseph Cooper were there. Elias is one of the greatest ministers now in our society and he had very extensive service chiefly against a worldly spirit and against war. It seemed hard work and like hard getting along. Many were, as he expressed it, drunk and asleep as in the night. This afternoon they had a meeting at Cropwell. Elias was almost silent and the service fell on Nathan Smith and myself. I had satisfaction though I thought things were low. Lukewarmness, stupidity and an insatiable thirst after the world and the love of money I fear prevails.
<pb id="A0011522_076"/>
14th of the Fifth Month. I was at Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. Elias Hicks from Long Island was there and had close extensive service and I had the approbation of some worthy elder at the conclusion. David Bacon and Jonathan Evans were there.
15. Elias Hicks was at our meeting. Some thought it the largest they had ever seen there and Elias was raised in great eminence and authority some say it was a tendering time to many. I went this afternoon with Elias Hicks and several others to brother Aaron Wills’s to dine and this afternoon to Ancocas meeting. Elias was quite silent: but not so with me. I had satisfaction. I parted with Elias Hicks and his companion from Long Island with feeling nearness. Elias said he had felt a great nearness towards me and hoped that I would not repent coming so far with him. The rest of this week about home.
20. Was First Day. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting on foot. Had satisfaction. A pretty good meeting. Went to see cousin Benjamin Warrington under affliction with a lame arm a swelling and I called to see Levi Heaton, a poor lame afflicted young man.
21. About a pump for Joshua Porter, 18 [feet] 9[inches] long put in on Fifth Day [24].
22. At our meeting. Josiah Burr and Beulah Haines were married and a very poor low dull time it was in viewing the state of the people and the language of conduct. Often at marriages this occurs. Crucify him crucify him: ye have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you not withstanding  <note resp="transcr">James 5:6</note> . All passes for good currency and the watchmen cry all is well. I attended and saw nothing but what was orderly, though their great parade and conformity to the spirit of the world in their fashions superfluity and costly array bring death and darkness so here the true life is oppressed as a cart with sheaves.
23. Made a pump for Thomas Lippincott, 14 [feet] long, all settled.
24. Put in Porter’s pump and mended three for Amos Hewlings.
25. About home. A very fine shower after a very dry time.
26. About home.
27. Was First Day at our meeting which some of our elders say was favored.

1st of the Sixth Month. Butchering for market.
2. Was our select meeting at Haddonfield. Middling well.
3. Was First Day at our meeting. Peter Andrews and Samuel Townsend were there and had considerable to say. This afternoon we had a meeting at the Lower Schoolhouse which was a lively satisfactory time to me.
4. Was our Quarterly Meeting and it was agreed to be a solid good meeting.
5. Was our preparative meeting: an owning time, a healing time, a strengthening time and we stood in need of it. Went to T. Stokes.
6. I was finishing a pump for Thomas Stokes, 23 foot long, all settled.
7. Tending corn.
8. Was Monthly Meeting. John Reeve was there and had a great deal to say but to me it was a low time.
9. About home making a pump for Edward French.
10. Was First Day at our meeting very trying and dull forepart but ended well this afternoon. John Reeve had a meeting here very much crowded and he has a great deal to say.
11. About home finishing E.F. his pump.
12. I put in Edward French’s pump, 25 feet long, all settled and I then went to our meeting William Scatterthite was there on his way to Redstone. Tomme Lowney was with him and a clever time I think it was.

15. We finished it 20 feet long: all settled.

17. Was First Day. We went to Cropwell Meeting. Martha Allinson from Burlington was there. Things seemed low and hard getting along, but I hope ended pretty well.
18. Tending corn.
19. At our meeting it seemed like deep wading and hard work to keep the chin above water but did come off at last with the approbation or countenance of one of our critics.
20 and 21. Tending corn.
22. I was at Cropwell Meeting which was satisfactory to me in some degree.
23. At work amongst our corn.
24. Was First Day. I had (with the approbation of my Friends) a meeting at the head of Timber creek held at Nathan Lippincott’s which was larger than was expected. Nathan Smith, William Ashby, and Martin Moody were there and I believe the meeting was not any disadvantage to any nor disgrace to the society. I thought there was a good degree of the ownings of truth and not a shut up but an open time.
25. Rainy. See Isaac Penington’s <italic>Works</italic>, volume 1, page 547. He says, That gathering which is in the life and power is [the] true church and that which is not is a synagogue of Satan. Let them profess what they will, for the living God dwells in living temples only and the prince of death dwells in all the territories of death.
26. At our meeting and hard work to stem the torrent of indolence and lukewarmness but did come off with approbation and a degree of satisfaction. The rest of this week closely engaged tending corn.
[28.] Seventh Day. Got timber for Isaac Cooper’s pump
{1798-07}
1 of the Seventh Month. Was First Day. I went to see my beloved friend Joshua Evans just returned from a journey of above 400 miles in Virginia and Pennsylvania. When I came to his door he said, well now this is brotherly. We went to Newtown to meeting which he said was smaller than common and he had considerable to say in his close plain searching way. We labored together and he said after meeting he thought I did pretty well, though I complained of hard getting along. I spent this afternoon with this, my beloved friend and fellow laborer. Between us there has been a distinguished unity ever since I embarked in the cause of truth, for then he, as it were, took me by the hand and steadied me as a father and so he has been to me ever since we being remarked as yoke mates when our lots were cast together at meetings, visiting of families, and in private families. Little did we think that this would be the last afternoon we should ever have together.
Second Day. Reaping wheat and I went to the burial [of] Esther Stokes (she died very suddenly) and being fatigued with hard labor felt unfit for religious exercise when I got there and was alarmed with a prospect of a spirit prevailing so far from what it should be at such a time, but after a time of close struggling with a spirit of indolence which was too prevalent there seemed to be a change of feeling and a degree of that which casts out fear and I had an open satisfactory time. exceeding hot weather several days together.
3. Was our preparative meeting. Labored through death for the arising of life and came off with approbation and satisfaction.
4 and 5. Reaping and about house etc.
6. Was Monthly Meeting and I believe not the poorest by far. John Collins went with me amongst the women and I thought we came off much better than I expected, the waters seeming low got some relief.
7. My two sons and I was reaping and reaped above an acre apiece. Heard of the death of dear friend Joshua Evans and a man died very sudden this week: Reaping at 4 o’clock and a corpse before dark.
<pb id="A0011522_078"/>
[Right marginal note] 27th of the Ninth Month 1795. Joshua Evans says in his Journal he was 64, makes him 67 years 2 months and 19 days.
8th of the Seventh Month 1798. Was a poor time though some bubblings of life as I thought and a vast concourse of people there was of different colors. The Negroes and Indians for whom he had been a great advocate testified their regard for him by their attending of his burial as well as the white people. Just as the burial got to the meeting house a very heavy shower of rain began. It was the time of their afternoon meeting. I thought things seemed low at first but growed better. Nathan Smith and John Reeve was there and had good service and I had a share with them to good satisfaction and I believe the meeting ended solid and well concurring testimonies were given in concerning this faithful devoted servant of the Lord who seemed to have done his days work and died in a good old age and gathered like a shock of corn in its season <note resp="transcr">Job 5:26</note> .
He told me this last First Day that when he returned from his last journey of above 400 miles into Virginia and Pennsylvania that when he set his foot on the Jersey shore it felt to him as if he had done with or nearly done with his native land but the prospect of visiting England or the European nations had scarcely been out of his mind in his last journey. And I observe it is no rare or uncommon thing for such Friends to be released and taken away under such prospect, and a lesson of deep instruction and humility there is in such instances. This our dear friend died very suddenly. Having been at work in the field very early in the morning, came to the house, washed himself and lay down and told his wife he felt a pain at his breast and was dead in the space of five or six minutes after he came in without further complaint or struggle, but after he lay down went off and lay as if he had gone to sleep.
9. Finishing reaping.
10. At our meeting and came off very well as far as I know.
16. About getting in our harvest etc.
17. At our meeting. Not much satisfaction. The rest of this week very busy about hay etc.
22. Was First Day. That sweet spirited much esteemed generally beloved minister Elizabeth Collins was there and had an open time chiefly towards the drooping spirit but a pretty close scratch at the worldlings and careless.
23. About our hay etc.
24. At our meeting. Hannah Reeves was there and said a good deal to us and I had some satisfaction at last.
25. Getting hay etc.
26. We went to Evesham Meeting which was to good satisfaction. The things are low.
27. Very early this morning William Troth came and told me Obadiah Hanes desired me to come to see him. He had gave way to great excess in the use of strong drink and was under great distress and trouble of mind. I had a favored open satisfactory time with him and I believe many pertinent hints remarks and caution were brought to my remembrance for him. He seemed in great distress and trouble of mind even to trembling and very tender and much contrited. I thought I left him more quiet and stiller. I came to Cropwell Meeting which was small and the waters low but labored through to some satisfaction.
28. About a pump for Matthias Lindinmire.
29. Was First Day. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting. Rather hard getting along at first but growed [sic] better. R. Cowperthwaite was there. I thought the meeting ended very well.
30. Rainy. Finishing M.L. pump.
31. At our meeting. Pretty well as far as I know, but after meeting we had a conference, not a strengthening gathering time but far from it, yet I have a hope we shall be a help to one another. A wounding scattering time.
<pb id="A0011522_079"/>
{1798-08}
1st of the Eighth Month, 1798, and Fourth of the week. Took Mathias Lintinmires pump home, 9 feet 6 inches long. All settled between us. Then we went to work at a pump for Stacy Haines.
[2.] Fifth Day finished Stacy Haines pump, 23 feet long.
[3.] Sixth Day at work at a pump for Job Haines 18 long.
[4.] Seventh Day finished it and took it home. A great rain this afternoon.
5 of the Month was First Day. This last week I have read Joshua Evans' journal, that part through three summers in which he visited New England, Nova Scotia, Canada, Otego, Genesee Country and the Indian Nations at Stockbridge, Tuskarrow, Oneida etc. and his journey to Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Country, Virginia and Redstone and this last summer again to the Yearly Meeting at Blackwater in Virginia and through Pennsylvania. I went to see him next day after he got home as I noted a little back. 
This summer I been reading the works of that eminent servant of the Lord, Isaac Penington, first volume, see page 602: concerning love question. What is love?
Answer: What shall I say of it, or how shall I in words express its nature? It is the sweetness of life. It is the sweet, tender, melting nature of God, flowing up through his seed of life into the creature and of all things making creature most like unto himself, both in nature and operation. It fulfils the law, it fulfils the gospel, it wraps up all in one and brings forth all in the oneness. It excludes all evil out of the heart; it perfects all good in the heart. A touch of love doth this in measure: perfect love doth this in fullness. But how can I proceed to speak of it! O that the souls of all that fear and wait on the Lord might feel its nature fully; and then would they not fail of its sweet overcoming operations, both towards one another and towards enemies. The great healing, the great conquest, the great salvation is reserved for the full manifestation of the love of God. His judgments, his cuttings, his hewings by the word of his mouth are but to prepare for, but not to do the great work of raising up the sweet build of his life, which is to be done in love and in peace and by the power thereof, and this my soul waits and cries after. Even the full springing up of love in my heart and in the swallowing of me wholly into it and the bringing of my soul wholly forth in it that the life of God in its own perfect sweetness may freely run forth through this vessel, and not be at all tinctured by the vessel, but perfectly tincture and change the vessel into its own nature. And then shall no faults be found in my soul before the Lord but the spotless life be fully enjoyed by me and become a perfectly pleasant sacrifice to my God.
O! How sweet is love! How pleasant is its nature! How takingly doth it behave its self in every condition, upon every occasion, to every person and about everything! How tenderly, how readily doth it help and serve the meanest! How patiently, how meekly doth it bear all things, either from God or man, how unexpectedly so ever they come, or how hard so ever they seem. How doth it believe. How doth it hope. How doth it excuse, how doth cover that which seemeth not to be excusable and not fit to be covered! How kind is it even in its interpretations and changes concerning miscarriages! It never over-chargeth, it never grates upon the spirit of him whom it reprehends. It never hardens, it never provokes but carrieth a meltingness and power of conviction with it. This is the nature of God. This in the vessels capacitated to receive and bring it forth in its glory. The power of enmity is not able to stand against but falls before and is overcome by [it].
Fifth of the Eighth Month 1798. Was First Day. Went to our meeting and to me the forepart was a trying wearisome time but at last I ventured and a healing strengthening uniting gathering time it was or these worlds carry me out, for I am wounded etc. [2 Chronicles 18:33]: which was the case I believe, with many cast down, wounded, disabled, invaladed [sic], crippled, and not fit for the service of the King of Kings etc.
<pb id="A0011522_080"/>
6th of the Eighth Month, 1798. About home doing something at a pump for I Cooper.
7. I went to mend a pump for Thomas Porter then Lucas Gibbs and I went to the burial of Stacy Lippincott in the very bloom of life and left a wife with several small children and she like for another very soon I had a few words at the house and a broken heart tendering time it seemed to be. Got to the meeting house in good season at meeting time.
Zechariahs Ferris was there and his companion Simon Hadley and Benjamin Swet. It was a pretty open time. The meeting very large and I hope ended very well. This was our preparative meeting.
[Left marginal note]. The doctor[s] say his disorder was very much like the yellow fever. He smelt very bad. The weather very hot.
8. At work at some pumps.
9. Took Isaac Cooper’s pump home and finished it, 24 feet long, and I stopped at the burial of old Samuel Murrel an old great rum drinker. I am now informed that it is a very melancholy time in Philadelphia. The yellow fever broke out again, spread much about the town and is very mortal. People much alarmed and moving out. It has been very hot weather several weeks past.
10. Was our Monthly Meeting day. The first sitting was lively and quieting and some matters lively handled in the last but I fear it is become too easy, too light, and cheap a thing to speak in our Monthly Meeting.
11. About home about sundry little matters about the pump etc.
12. Was First Day. We went to Evesham Meeting which ended pretty well I hope and we went to William Rogers afternoon: I fear not to profit as thing fell out.
13. About home. Most exceeding hot weather and much rain now abouts.
14. At our meeting a time of very low water and not much satisfaction.
15. Rainy. We went to Enoch Evans about a pump.
16. At York at pump.
17. Finished Enoch Evans pump 28 feet long and there seemed danger of his two sons being lost in the well by a damp in it, for they seemed to hardly have strength and breath to get out. We stopped at Cropwell Meeting which was small. Several of their elders [had] gone to court to defend the cause of the Indians but the meeting was satisfactory, as much so as anyone I have had some time.
18. I went to take a pump home to Joseph Evans, 10 feet long, all settled.
19. Was First Day. My son John and I went to Cropwell Meeting. Elizabeth Collins and Reuben Hilliar was there and an open heavenly highly favored time it was. I did believe few if any [were] there but what had a sense of holy quiet and heavenly goodness.
[Right marginal note] Got new axle tree put in the wagon.
20. About a pump for Joseph Roberts, 16 feet long.
21. At our meeting. Dinah Lamburn from Pennsylvania was there I thought it was a very poor meeting and the strangers words entirely answered my sense of the state of the meeting, for she spoke closely and smartly to the dull low state which appeared sad and sorrowful.
[Right marginal note] Mended William Burros pump.
22. Finish Roberts pump.
23. Putting skeens in wagon etc.
24. I went to mend a pump for John Collins and went to the burial of Thomas Ridgeway, a young man died with the consumption. I had something to say to the people both at the house and at the grave. The last was a favored satisfactory owning time.
25. About home about sundry little matters.
26. Was First Day. I was at our meeting. Not much satisfaction, waters low. Lucas Gibbs and I went as far as brother Aaron Wills to lodge.
27. We went to the quarterly select meeting of Burlington. Zachariah Faris was there and Samuel Emlen and Rebekah Jones and an highly favored time it was in both fore and latter part. I had a considerable share of the labor with my brethren and they owned me, as Lucas said, with the right hand of fellowship.
<pb id="A0011522_081"/>
[Left marginal note] Mary West buried.
28th of the Eighth Month, 1798. Was Quarterly Meeting at Burlington and a solid good meeting it was.
29. About home.
30. Went to Evesham meeting. Dinah Lamborn was there and had a pretty deal to say but I thought it was a low time and a sad sore trial I met with after meeting.
31st 9 Month [sic]. Making a plow for Thomas Wallace and went to our select meeting at Moorestown. Some I believe were favored, but on the whole dryness to what should be. We hear that the yellow fever is very mortal in Philadelphia and that the greater part of the inhabitants is fled and that it is in Burlington and likewise in New York they are moving out and that it is at Morris’s River very mortal – twelve died in eleven days. And we hear that divers have died on the highways, in the wood, barns and at Moorestown several were buried last week with the disorder; and of dismal war in Ireland – great destruction and bloodshed and on the seas there is sorrow on the sea it cannot rest. And there is much talk of war here with the French and the people much seem disposed for war, so that there seems a gloomy prospect.
[Right marginal note] I have met with things of late very trying to my brittle temper and stood them not so well as would have been best. They have come from different quarters, even with some with whom we have taken sweet counsel together, but I have a hope all will work together for the better.
{1798-09}
2nd. Was First Day morning. I had a perplexing time. My mind was toward Cropwell and I set off to go there but could not: things and the road looked so gloomy. I tried it several times, that way and towards our meeting, till I was almost out of conceit of going to any meeting which was I believe what the enemy wanted: if he could, to keep me from any meeting. But the scale turned for our meeting and the cloud seemed to go off and my mind settled. Many being come from Philadelphia, it was a crowded meeting and a Methodist minister amongst the rest and a favored time it was to me. I thought it a great favor that we came off with any degree of reputation.
3. Sowing wheat etc.
4. Was our preparative meeting. A hard hammering time and hard getting along.
5 and 6. Sowing rye etc.
7. Was Monthly Meeting. Jonathan Kirkbright and William Blake from Pennsylvania were there and were favored in the exercise of their gifts. I thought there was something of an heavenly nature attended the meeting and savor of life. A better meeting throughout than common. I went in amongst the women and had a rousing time to satisfaction on the subject of spirituous liquors. Though there] might be some misses, I had sweet peace.
8. Sowing rye finished.
9. Was First Day. I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting which was low and dull the forepart, so that I was afraid to venture, but it growed [sic] better and I had a favored time like a full flowing tide to good satisfaction. Dined at brother Joseph Warr
ington’s and they were very kind to me and loving.
10. About getting some hay.
11. At our meeting. A very low dull time though I came off middling on the subject of Cain and Abel’s offerings etc.
12. About home trimming some casks etc.
13. I went to make a pump for John Bispham on the river shore.
14. Finished Bisham’s pump, 16 feet long, all settled.
15. At home mending some shoes etc.
16. Was First Day. We daily hear of the great mortality in Philadelphia. Went to our meeting, a distressing mortifying time to me. The meeting very large.
18. At our meeting John Cox was there and had close service with a worldly spirit.
19. I finish Dovers pump, 15 [feet] long.
20. I was at our select meeting at Haddonfield. Some life attended. I got some relief and satisfaction.
21. Was Quarterly Meeting which on the whole was satisfactory to me. It was a trying time getting representatives to attend the Yearly Meeting. None, not one seemed free to go, the sickness in town was so great and the town so desolate, very few friends remaining there.
22. About home.
<pb id="A0011522_082"/>
23rd of the Ninth Month, 1798. Was First Day. Was Yearly Meeting. Not one belonging to our quarter seems like to go except Samuel Townsend from Cape May who seemed like to go and take our answers to the queries and he seemed very diffident. The sickness in town was so great and the town so disolate [desolate?] that divers Friends thought it was impracticable a Yearly Meeting could be held.
[Right marginal note continued in left margin: Eight or more of our most valuable friends died with the fever catched at the Yearly Meeting, viz. Warner Mifflin, Abraham Gibbons, Hannah Lindley. divers others catched the fever and died, James Emlen, Robert Kirkbridge.
24. At work at home.
25. At our meeting. A very shut up low night season.
26 and 27. About home sowing fodder etc.
28. Some friends from Virginia were here to see us, Mary Haines and several others.
29. I went to hew a pump for J. Haines, 25 feet 8 inches long.
30. Was First Day. Martin Moody and Samuel Townsend were all that attended our Yearly Meeting and Martin said it was about as large as a Monthly Meeting. They had but one sitting and adjourned till the Twelfth Month next and Martin was taken ill and thought by the doctor to be the disorder of which abundance die both in city and country. (About three days after he came from town.)
Rebecca Wright was at our meeting and was favored in the exercise of her gift, though hard work with an indolent lukewarm state. Came off pretty well.

I finished John Hain’s pump, 25 feet, 8 inches long, all settled.
4. About getting in buckwheat etc.
5. Was Monthly Meeting. The first sitting was a lively favored time. A young woman, they say her name is Shreve, was there and spoke lively and Deborah Stewart and Elizabeth Collins had lively testimonies but flatness, dullness, dryness, nakedness appeared at one time in the meeting for business: we heard of the death of Robert Kirkbrit, an elder [who] was at last yearly meeting.
6. About home making some cider, gathering apples etc.

20. I went to the burial of an old Negro woman which I thought was a pretty solid favored time. A pretty many white people were there and although a number of them were of that sort who make no pretenses to religion and some whose hearts seemed to be like the nether millstone, yet they behaved very well. This afternoon I mended Jacob Lippincott’s pump.
21. Was First Day. I went to the burial of E. Hulings and then to a meeting held at Pine Grove Schoolhouse which I thought was like to be an open favored time but about the middle of the meeting a woman that came from town I thought seemed to be tendered was taken with fits and it broke up the meeting.

At work at Lippincott’s pump and I went to Cropwell Meeting which was small and very low and poor but John Cox and brother Aaron Wils were there and at last John had a very open favored time. It was their preparative meeting and on whole came off very well. John Cox and brother Wills came home with me and lodged and a sweet satisfactory time we had together to our mutual comfort and edification.

[4.] 2 [sic] of the Eleventh Month. Was First Day. My wife and I went to the Lower Schoolhouse Meeting which was a satisfactory meeting to me.

This several weeks past the yellow fever has been abateing and about ten days past the people have been flocking into town again, though about two weeks ago it is said many that returned catched [sic] the disorder and died.

14. About a pump for John Warrington, 22 long. 
15. Finished it. Has been a smart cold freezing time, but a few days warm and this evening a heavy thundershower.
[Right marginal note] I was at the Schoolhouse Meeting and a highly favored time it was.

19. This morning I mended Joseph Matlack’s pump and Joseph Warrington’s and then went to an appointed meeting of conference at Evesham on the subject of war, following the fashions etc. On the whole I think there was an evidence of the ownings of truth and savor of life in a good degree. satisfactory to me.
Last evening warm and rainy and thunder and this morning, 20, snow and winter, like a very violent storm of snow to turn out in. Martha Allinson and Lydia Hoskins were at our meeting and had good service. 
As large a snow as is common and very cold about home. Getting wood etc.
25. Was First Day. I went to Ancocas meeting with which I find some were better pleased than myself. I found hard work but not much cause of complaint. Brother A. Wills and I went to see John Smith under great exercise. 
<pb id="A0011522_084"/>
26 of the Eleventh Month, 1798. Went with brother Aaron Wills to Chesterfield select meeting which was an highly favored tendering time. Lodged at our kinsman Jospeh and Meribah Fowlers. The love and sweetness and nearness after this meeting was such that I [have] scarcely ever seen amongst Friends before.
27. Went to their Quarterly Meeting which was a solid good meeting. A very great revival and improvement in this place, a large number of young people beautifully coming forward. Brother A. Wills thinks it was the best Quarterly Meeting he ever seen. Things were lively spoke to and the testimony raised in many respects. I had good satisfaction. We lodged at William Black’s and called to see R. Wright, a mother in Israel.
28. Came home, found all middling well. A few days past it has been very severe cold winter weather. The roads very frozen and rough but I suffered but little with the cold. Grows warmer.
29. I went to Caleb Crispin’s to make a pump 19 feet long. [crossed though] all settled
30. A perplexing day hauling hay, but it ended very well. Hard labor.
{1798-12}
3 of the Twelfth Month. I put in and finished Crispin’s pump and then went to our select Quarterly Meeting the first held at Evesham. There was divers worthy Friends from neighboring quarters John Tatham, John Reeve, and Hannah and John Cox and I believe it was a favored time to some but it was a poor time with me and no wonder for I have wearied and toiled beyond measure, having not had more than half a night’s sleep two nights past but wearying several hours before day. After meeting mended two pumps for Joseph Rogers, so wrestled with the world to satisfaction.
2. Was First Day at our meeting. Rebecca Wright and John Cox were there. R. Wright was highly favored. A solid good meeting. I dined with N. and R. Wright at C. French’s. Conversation poor and unprofitable.
3. Was our Quarterly Meeting, the first held at Evesham, thought to be above one thousand people. Many public Friends and a pretty deal of preaching for a Quarterly Meeting. It was thought by some an owning time and I think so too, but am looking for something further and better, though we had some lively smart work.
4. Was our preparative meeting. Ebeneezer Miller and George Churchman [were there]. George had some lively service at last and Ebenezer had a great deal to say.
5 and 6 About home getting wood etc.

I dined at William Savery’s and he shewed us several letters from Ireland giving account of the dreadful wars, bloodshed and great trials of Friends and their wonderful preservation there. I attended this Yearly Meeting till the last sitting but one. Some of these sittings were highly favored times, the testimony raised in divers respects, but in some I was stripped very poor on account of the diffidence and giving way to the fear of mar[illegible] but I thought there were some there 70 years of age or near it that never seen such a time of favor before. Daniel Dead from York government was there, a most sweet eminent minister.
[16.] On First Day was at our meeting. Benjamin Clerk was there at time of some satisfaction to me, though lowness in the meeting. Last week was lively stormy time: snow and rain, streets very slippery. Several slipped down and broke [illegible] bones 5 or 6.

<pb id="A0011522_085"/>
17th Twelfth Month, 1798. About home getting wood etc. Sundry things.
18. At our meeting. A marriage Josiah Engle and Middeton. A poor low time.
19 and 20. Stormy and snowy.
21. Killing hogs. The rest of the week about salting pork and a very great snow again.
23. Was First Day. At our meeting. Waters were low but at last some life and the meeting ended lively and savory and satisfactory to me. Last week when at town I was very much taken up early and late, some times till ten at night: but I was favored with good company. lodged with John Parrish, John Simpson, and Jacob Lindley whose company was very edifying.
Jacob Lindley was mentioning some of Abraham Gibbins words after being at the Yearly Meeting, when it was adjourned when the yellow fever greatly raged. They were speaking of the danger of going to town at that time. A. Gibbins said he had seen a state wherein death was no more terror than to put off one suit of clothes and put on another. And in 1797, when the fever was very mortal at the lower end of the town I was with him at J. James’s and he said he found he could not have peace in staying at home and he concluded it was better to come to the Yearly Meeting and die in peace than to stay at home without peace, and that life was not worth having without peace. 
This conversation brought to my mind some expressions of William Hunt as we were going up Haddonfield Hill to meeting, he expecting to embark soon on a religious visit to Europe. I queried with him if he was not afraid to go to sea. He answered that there was something awful in it, but said when the mind has passed through the necessary baptism there was not much for the fear of dead to lay hold of. He died in England of the small pox.
When I was at the last Yearly Meeting I went with Jacob Lindley and John Parrish to see five Indian chiefs come many hundred miles on business with our leading men about their lands. They were very stout lusty men, their heads shaved and faces painted one very dismal color: as purple like a corpse lain several days.
24. Went up in Evesham on business at Joshua Lippincott’s.
25. At our meeting and a lively favored owning gathering healing time to me.

<pb id="A0011522_086"/>
11th of the First Month 1799. At our monthly meeting for the most part, but poor yet some little* life, though on the whole mortifying. I hope to improve upon it.
[Left marginal note] * handing out some fragments from the Yearly Meeting. J.C., W. Rogers and I went to women on that subject middling.
12. About home chiefly making a tub etc.
13. Was First Day. Went to the burial of an infant child of Job Cowperthwaite’s and then to our meeting. Some satisfaction at the house but a very low time at meeting. We hear of some having the fever in town and divers dying with it and one in the country, Henry Wood, being very ill.
A book giving an account of the first settling of New England mentions a time of great sickness amongst the Indians. There Dinah Milop, an old Indian doctoress lately informs us of a time of great sickness amongst the Indians as she heard her mother relate and by account something like the sickness in Philadelphia, very mortal so as it seemed as all would be swept off. In conversation with Hannah French this week (upwards of 80 years of age) she said she remembered hearing her father tell of a great sickness amongst the Indians wherein it was said they died about like rotten sheep and one instance in particular an Indian woman was found dead on the road and a child sucking at her breast.
First Day afternoon a note of some expression of a minister preserved by John Rutty in his <italic>Diary</italic>, page 280-1. “What a beggarly contemptible thing would it be for any who through laziness of pride would not dig or work for themselves. To be lounging about the doors of the rich, and depend on them for food! If this be a pitiful and contemptible situation in a temporal relation, see whither it be not that of several of yours in a spiritual. Even you who by your gestures manifest an uneasy expectation of being fed with words, whilst you will not beg of God himself as you ought to do with prostrated souls.”
In John Rutty’s <italic>Spiritual Diary</italic> I find this note, page 173, taken I believe out of the book above mentioned giving an account of a work of grace amongst the Indians in New England: J. Eliot in New England translated the Bible and other books into the Indian language, having learnt the language with this God-like view, by whose means Indian churches were established and supplied with Indian preachers and Indian elders. Same book Rutty says, page 163, a curious history: several Indians in America convinced of the fall and restoration of man, and of the inward manifestation of Christ and of the profit of silent worship. <note resp="transcr">John Rutty, A Spiritual Diary, and Soliloquies. London: Printed and Sold by James Phillips, 1796.</note> 
See the <italic>Life and Posthumous Works</italic> of Richard Claridge, page 316, His faithful testifying against the general covetousness in 1720. We are now come to the remarkable year 1720, a time [at] which it becomes us to be humbled in the remembrance of a day of trial, when the love of money and the tempting bait of profit adhered multitudes both of this and other nations into an inordinate imprudent pursuit of it. But though too many of even the professors of the truth itself were prevailed upon by the popular temptations, yet some were preserved from and enabled to testify against the general corruption, among whom it were in justice not to mention him, R. Claridge. He was concerned at that time to bear a zealous and fervent testimony in the public assemblies, full of scriptural exhortations against the sin of covetousness [sic], shewing
<pb id="A0011522_087"/>
shewing the inconsistency of such an extravagant pursuit of the uncertainties of this world as was then practiced, with that self denial and contentment which it becomes a Christian to be found in. Nor was he wanting privately to admonish such particular persons of his acquaintance as he thought a timely caution might be useful to.
Had the faithful exhortation of him and some other worthies in Israel been duly regarded, the professors of truth would not have mixed themselves with worldly minded men nor have partaken of the dishonor and disappointment that ensued.
15 of the First Month. Went to our meeting. A poor low time to me.
16. About home.
17. Went to mend some pumps for Benjamin Cooper. About home the rest of this week, pretty quiet and still but more of the inward life is wanting.
20 of the First Month 1799. Was First Day, See Rutty’s <italic>Spiritual Diary,</italic> page 38. On reading a fragment of James Naylor: Lord, give me his spirit. Mark, not a worldly spirit such as above described. He presses to the stature of manhood and fullness in Christ, nights of watching and days of mourning for past transgressing. Says he, O my deficiency in such waitings and mournings. 
See Rutty’s <italic>Diary</italic>, page 28, a charming account of the five Indian nations in America supported and maintained by principles of honor and not profit in the <italic>London Magazine</italic>, February 1755. Those Indians have one notable instance of dominion over appetite, viz. they have all kinds of food in equal esteem, deeming it womanish to have any delicacy in the choice of food. Here they surpass us, though some little barbarity sometimes prevails among them. But surely in this and other cases the heathens shall rise in judgment against us Christians (and may I not add) the language of whose conduct is "what shall we eat?" "what shall we drink?" and "where with shall we be clothed?" <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:31</note>   We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 4:1.</note> . See William Penn’s <italic>No Cross No Crown,</italic> page 145, Chapter XIII, on covetousness or avarice, Peter Charron’s testimony against it and Abraham Cowley’s etc. <note resp="transcr">William Penn, No Cross, No Crown, Part, Chapter 13. Hunt seems to refer to the entire chapter.</note>  
This 20 went to our meeting and an highly favored time it was. Few if any there I believe but what had a sense of it, a gathering time.
21. I went to work at a pump for Benjamin Matlack.
22. At our meeting, middling, nothing like last First Day.
23. I finished Benjamin Matlack’s pump, 26 feet 6 inches long.

4. At work at a pump for Benajah Butcher, 27 feet long.
5. At our preparative meeting, a pretty good time. Finished Butcher’s pump and took it home above Holly.

It was a favored open time the first sitting, but that for discipline was very low. Lodged at William Wilkins. Elizabeth Kealing and Sarah Pope were there. We had a favored time in the family at parting.
<pb id="A0011522_088"/>
8 of the Second Month. At our Monthly Meeting. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, February 1799: "The Friends appointed to take an opportunity with Enoch Allen report a compliance therewith and apprehend a good degree of sincerity to attend his Acknowledgment, which again being read and weightily deliberated upon, it appeared most easy to friends to receive it, and our friends, John Collins and John Hunt expressing a willingness to pay him a visit on the occasion, they are therefore appointed thereto."</note>  Mary Newbold Jr, William Shatterthite, Reubin Hilliar, Thomas Lowrey, John Hoskins and other strangers [were there].

23. Abigail and I went as far as brother William Rogers to lodge.
24. Was First Day. William Rogers and his daughter and I and my daughter went to Mount Holly meeting which was but a low poor time, though I rather think things are mending with them.

25. Went to Burlington select meeting. Life was sitting amongst us. An instructing time. Lodged at our brother Joseph Buzby's.

There was a great shower of strangers and but little preaching first sitting: John Simpson and John Stapler, William Murse and Mark Miller, Joseph Whiteall and Joseph Clements, Mary Newhold Jr. and Martha Allinson and John Cox. The discipline meeting pretty well though mortifying to me. My brethren and sisters far out shine me and to me seem not so subject to misses, though I hope a time of instruction and improvement. Mary Newbold Jr. and Martha Allinson propose entering on a family visit to Evesham particular meeting.
9. Very rainy.
10. Was First Day at our meeting. A poor shut up time with me, but William Wood was remarkably favored. Very severe cold snow. winter weather yet as I ever seen for the season. Very little to be done for several weeks together.
11. I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. John Simpson was there and William Murse forepart. John, Benjamin Swet and myself had a lively favored time to my satisfaction. Last meeting for discipline pretty lively. I went to the women’s meeting and had no cause to repent it although my work was not of the smooth kinds.
[Right marginal note] Read Job Scott’s Journal the second time through.
The rest of this week about home, very cold stormy weather but clear up moderate.
I forgot: last third day meeting John Simpson was there, Joseph Evans and Rebecca Roberts were married, a large crowded meeting. J: Simpson had excellent extensive service. He came to Joseph Roberts in the evening, had a good deal to say amongst us.

18. About home.

22. Was Quarterly Meeting. Benjamin Swett said considerable, though the waters to me seemed lower than sometimes, though on the whole middling.
23. About home.
24. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. Mary Newbold Jr. and Martha Allinson were there. Just got through with their family visit. I thought I perceived something like a dew from their family visit, though the meeting seemed low. William Rogers went with me to see John Borton [who is] in a deep consumption.
25. Trimming orchard etc.
26. At our meeting to me, but poor times, windy again.
[30.] Fifth [Day] of the week. I went to Evesham to mend the pump and was at their meeting which was smaller than common, so it seemed the family visit made but little lasting impressions. The meeting was a distressed poor low time I could do nothing among them and did not bear it as well as would have been best: as a sheep before the shearer is dumb so he opened not his mouth  <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 53:7</note> . A great lesson for us to learn.
31. Was First Day. At our meeting, an open strengthening time. My cousin Peter Ellis, Thomas Gaskill and William Newbold and I visited Benjamin Scattergood some favored. A day satisfactory.
{1799-04}
1st Fourth Month. At work at home in the orchard etc. O when shall I learn to overcome evil with good, far the wisest way.
<pb id="A0011522_090"/>
2 of the Fourth Month, 1799. A very stormy day. We went to the burial of Ruth Bispham, a very ancient Friend. At the house I had satisfaction. It was our preparative meeting, forepart very low, that for business better. J.C. and I went in among the women, came off pretty well. At the burying house there was a number of very stout young people and their appearance seemed stout against the truth and right way but I thought they rather came down and under something of a quieting calm.
3 and 4. About home, clears up very cold again.
5. Was Monthly Meeting. Rather low water with us. Stephen Grillett, Mary Newbold and Lydia Hoskins her sister and their father John Hoskins were there. Mary proposed going further with her family visit, viz. through our meeting, which was united with. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, April 1799: "Our esteemed friend Mary Newhold opened to this meeting the prospect of paying a religious visit to the families of friends within the limits of Chester Preparative Meeting, and produced a Meeting from the Monthly Meeting of Burlington expressive of their concurrence with her therein, which being read, was fully united with, and our friends John Collins and Rebecca Cowperthwaite expressing a willingness to accompany her therein, they are therefore at liberty to pursue their prospect as way may open. John Roberts, John Hunt, and Robert French are appointed to afford such further assistance as may be apprehended necessary; and report their service to the Meeting when performed."</note> 
6. About home plowing for oats etc.
7. Was First Day. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting and had no cause to repent going there. An open good meeting and about home.

13. Went to select meeting at Philadelphia and a favored edifying strengthening time it was.
14. Reuben Hilliard went with me to Frankford meeting which I thought ended well. We dined at Joseph Potts and had a pretty satisfactory time with the family and got back to town to the evening meeting, which to me was a satisfactory time. 
[Left marginal note] Had a good time in Samuel Emlen’s family
On Second Day, the 15, the Yearly Meeting began and I attended till the conclusion which was on Sixth of the week 3rd hour. <note resp="transcr">Journal inserts explanation "At the Yearly Meeting adjourned to the 12th month last, it was concluded to hold it in the future in the 4th month." (280)</note>  Some of the settings I was very poor and dull low times to me but most of them and some especially were highly favored healing strengthening times. A meeting on Fifth Day at Market Street [was] remarkably favored with a lively ministry. The service fell chiefly to Chalkley Abertson from Carolina, a sweet heavenly-minded man he seems to be, and James Simpson and Jesse Kersey. I came home on foot with 4 or 5 or 6 more.
[Left marginal note] Close work on divers subjects. The testimony raised in divers matters.
20. At work at a pump for Joseph Bispham. 
Felt much better for being at Yearly Meeting. O that the seed scattered may take root and bring forth fruit! <note resp="transcr">Luke 8:15</note>  As brother A. Wills says, and is it not said, they could not resist the spirit and wisdom by which Stephen spoke. See Acts 6 and 10 (Meditations). I wish there might be something after these meetings like this, see Matthew 26 and 73, Thou art one of them, thy speech betrayeth thee, the language of thy looks conduct and deportment <note resp="transcr">Journal continues "the evidence of thy looks, conduct and deportment, give evidence of improvement," 280, although this fits awkwardly with the quote from Matthew.</note> . See Proverbs 27:16: The ointment of his right hand betrayeth itself. 
I lodged at this Yearly Meeting chiefly with my worthy tender friend John Parrish, who seemed like a father or brother ever since our first acquaintance upward of twenty years, whose company has ever been comforting strengthening and edifying to me.
21. First Day at our meeting and a favored time it was to me, an opening on these words – that which lets will let until it be removed out of the way – a very extensive text it appeared to be. I saw much needed to be removed out of the way, many hindering things, felt no condemnation at our meeting. 
[23.] On Third Day it was a very dull shut up time to me. I had worked at a pump for Joseph Bispham quite too hard. 
[24.] Fourth Day. Put it in, 27 feet 9 inches long.
[25.] Fifth [Day] I was at Evesham meeting, sort of middling afternoon. Went to work at an old pump. Had a very troublesome fatiguing time, but got through with a good degree of patience. Finished on Sixth Day and came home, business in heaps and behindhand and my patience quite overcome. A sad wounding time.
[27.] Seventh Day. Very rainy a great storm.

28 Fourth Month, 1799. Was First Day. I was at our meeting silent as to me but R. Roberts was favored, [and] the London epistle was read.
[29.] Second Day. About home.

{1799-05}
5 of the Fifth Month Was First Day. I went to our meeting. Mary Newbold was there and had good service. Getting ready to plant.
7th. At our preparative meeting, came off pretty well.
8 and 9. Getting ready to plant.
10. Monthly Meeting. Some things very trying and on the whole but a very poor time.
11. Planting.

13. Finishing planting.
14. At our meeting. Christopher Anthony from Virginia was there and had excellent service. John Bishop and Ridgeway’s daughter was married. Christopher [Anthony] had most beautiful counsel to the young couple.
15. About home.
16. I went to the Schoolhouse Meeting and a sweet meeting it was although I had scrabling work to get there both inwardly and outwardly.
17. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Christopher Anthony at J. Rogers's. I had good satisfaction in his company. He had lately been at Redstone and gave me an account of that bay, so much talked of Eli Yarnall and that he told him the situation of his habitation and described his wife and children statures and features and the color of their hair which agrees with the account I had of William Skatterthwaite and many other very substantial so that I can believe it as if I seen and heard for myself but the like I never heard or read of in any age of the world.
[18.] 4 Day morning Mary Newbold, John Collins and wife and Rebekah Cowperthwaite were here on a family visit. Had a favored tendering time far beyond expectation.

20. About home planting truck etc.
21. At our meeting. Joshua Stokes and Rebekah Matlack were married. Mary Newbold Jr. was there and had good service but it seemed like hard labor. The meeting but low but ended middling. I think there is considerable improvement in accomplishing marriages but room and need of a great deal more.
The rest of this week about home till Seventh Day I went to mend a pump for Samuel Bispham and brought my son John home, he having served out his apprenticeship faithfully and reputably, which I think a great favor.
26. Was First Day. Mary Newbold was at our meeting and had lively service.
27. I was looking out for a settlement for John at Evesham.
28. At our meeting. A distressed poor dull time, all shut up. The rest of this week about home and about getting timber for John‘s shop.
{1799-06}
1 of the 6 was our quarterly select meeting at Evesham. The forepart was very low and dull but some strangers had lively service: Rebe Wright and Elizabeth Foulk especially so. We seem not quite deserted. Benjamin Clerk from Stony Brook came home with me and lodged with us.
<pb id="A0011522_092"/>
2nd of the Sixth Month 1799 was First Day. I went with Benjamin Clerk to Evesham Meeting and he had good service and Benjamin Swett also.
3. Was our Quarterly Meeting. Benjamin Clerk expressed a concern on account of our holding our Quarterly Meeting open for them that have no right and it was united with so far as to appoint a committee to consider the case and report to next quarterly [meeting]. This is what I have year past looked for, not doubting it would come about. We were favored with the company of divers worthy friends: Rebekah Wright and divers others. One most precious young minister from eastward, Henry Hull, on his way to visit the southern states and stood up beautifully; appeared like a bright star of the first magnitude.
4. Was our preparative meeting. Elizabeth Foulk from Philadelphia was there and was favored in the exercise of her most precious lively gift and a favored lively time it was.
[Right marginal note] A young woman. I think they’ll kill the priests.
5. Went [to] frame a shop for John at Evesham.
6. I went to the burial of John Borton. At the grave I had an opportunity to relieve my mind to good satisfaction. It was preparative meeting at Evesham which on the whole yielded some satisfaction. This afternoon raised John’s shop.
7. Was monthly meeting. John Reeve was there and I thought spoke well. The business was a better time to me than some. J. C. and me had a time among the women to a good degree of relief.
8. At home. Very stormy.
9. Was First Day. John Reeve was at our meeting and had a great deal to say and I thought that the meeting ended very well. Dined at Lucas Gibbs with John Reeve and brother A. Wills.
10. Went to the saw mill [to get] boards for John’s shop, a fatiguing time.
[Left marginal note] I had a close conference with a retason [?] to good satisfaction.
11. At our meeting, a very poor low dull time though R. Roberts was favored.
The rest of this week about tending corn etc.
[13.] Fifth Day last week I went to the burial of Jonathan Evans, my sister’s son, a young man died with a short illness. He died in Philadelphia and they brought him up to Samuel Evans. A very poor place for religion, a poor raw company I had to combat with. Nothing to be had among them without very hard labor worth going for.
16. Was First Day. Joseph Clerk came up from Philadelphia and I went to New Hopewell meeting which was small and things but low.
17. Helping John about his shop etc.
[Right marginal note] I went to see a poor man in a low way with Lucas Gibbs. Had satisfaction [illegible].
18. At our meeting. Rather more lively than some. Some life stirring. At work at home getting hay, mowing some clover, etc. the rest of this week.
23. Was First Day at our meeting. Indolence prevailed in the forepart but it was a favored healing time to me at last. Abraham Warrington and I went to visit Jeremiah Matlack. Had some satisfaction.

30. Was First Day. I was at the Schoolhouse Meeting. Benjamin Swett and Hannah Reeve were there we had a great deal said but little animation this week. I was at our meeting preparative. We had two new speakers J. M. and L.G. Children love to dabble in shallow water. I thought it a low time. I was at Evesham Preparative Meeting on Fifth Day, not so low as some times.
{1799-07}
6. Was Monthly Meeting. Joyce Buckman and Sarah Smith from Pennsylvania, small but precious sweet ministers, had good service yet the meeting for business was old fashioned outside, poor and talkative, but little of the animating precious life to be felt.
<pb id="A0011522_093"/>
7th of the Seventh Month, 1799. Was First Day. I went to Cropwell Meeting. Joyce Buckman of Pennsylvania and Sarah Smith <note resp="transcr">Journal gives "Elizabeth Smith," 280.</note>   were there and were lively in their ministry yet I thought things low.
8. Reaping.
9. At our meeting the above named friends were there and were sweet and lively in their ministry. If people did right, oh, how many more would there be of such plain innocent precious examples amongst the aged; but the way our youth take following the fashions, its not like they will make such. Very busy this week getting in our harvest.
[Marginal note] John Kay’s daughter was at meeting and died with the flux in a few days.
14. Seventh Month Was First Day at our meeting. Joseph Justice was there. He mentioned some might be nearer their end and had a good deal to say but it was a shut up time to me. This week about getting hay. I was unwell but forced to work very hard. First Day afternoon my wife and I and Lucas Gibbs and wife went to see a very poor sick man Hiram Castertine. He has lain many weeks under very afflicting humbling circumstances under a sense of past folly.
19. I went to Philadelphia to meet the Yearly Meeting’s committee on the case of the friends of Upper Canada. Seven or eight Friends gave up to visit them and friends urged me to go with them but I could not see how I could leave home reputably. If I could, I thing [think] [I] willing [would have] went with them. Some urged me very hard and I thing if way open I stand resigned to set off with them the 1st of the Ninth Month next.
20. I met a committee on Indian affairs. Five or six gave up to pay them a visit at Oneida, Tuscarora and there away. It appeared to me friends would have been glad if I would or could have gave up to go with them. It was a poor low time with me. I was very unwell with a violent flux or purging.
21. Was First Day. I was at our meeting and an open highly favored time it was, like a full flowing tide, to good satisfaction, Lucas Gibbs and I went to see E. French his daughter, very weak and low, and to Samuel Cowperthwaite’s.
22. I went to the burial of Hiram Casterline, a very poor man. Came off pretty well satisfied.
23. At our meeting, a very poor time, not satisfaction. The rest of this week very busy finishing hay. The weather very hot and dry. Great complaints of crops of grass being very light, not more than one half what was last year and the corn much wilted with the drought, all which seems to threaten or afford a gloomy prospect.
28. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. Much formality, lukewarmness and indifferency prevailed. Hard getting along, nothing to be hard without hard labor.
29. About home.
30. At our meeting. Hannah Reeve was there and had a good deal to say.
31. I went to Joshua Lippincott’s to put a new box in his pump and then William Rogers and I went to see our brother Aaron Wills. I was under some concern about going with Friends of the Yearly Meeting’s committee to Upper Canada. Could not find my way open to proceed.
{1799-08}
1 of the Eighth Month. I went to haul some boards for John Shop and was at Evesham Meeting and a pretty lively one it was. William Rogers and I went to see John Moor on account of his drinking to excess. He denied the charge and there seemed nothing to be done with him. A very fine rain after a long pinching dry time.
2. About a pump for John Hammit, 26 feet long a bottom piece.
<pb id="A0011522_094"/>
4th of Eighth Month 1799. Was First Day at our meeting. I could not get along as at some other times and I remembered to have seen it so with divers others. At times it seemed as if they could neither preach nor let alone even some of great attainments and great experience, however at last I thought I got through middling.
4. At work among our corn etc.
6. Was our preparative meeting, better than common. I thought it was pretty well conducted. I had some satisfaction.

9. Was Monthly Meeting, to me pretty well and satisfactory. No condemnation.

12. Made a bottom piece for a pump for Samuel Matlack, 19 long all settled.
13. At our meeting came off middling well I hope. At work at a pump for Joseph Roberts, 28 feet long.

18. Was First Day. John Cox Jr. was at our meeting. Had hard labor but got through very well at last. This afternoon I met John Simpson at Haddonfield at a Negro meeting held in their schoolhouse, which ended pretty well though we found it hard getting along. The Blacks were long a-gathering, which much unsettled, and hurt the service of the meeting. I lodged with John Simpson at John Blackwood’s, not a Friend, where we had a satisfactory sitting.
19. We went to Woodbury Quarterly Meeting. Hard getting along forepart, but it growed better. John Simpson and I went in among the women and I left Woodbury well satisfied, a healing time to me. John Simpson went then to see the great new school, but I gave out going with him, though he said it would be very pleasant if I would meet him at town.
20. At our meeting. No satisfaction. A poor time to me.
21. About home at sundry matters.
22. I went up to Haines’s grist mill.

25. Was First Day. John Simpson had appointed a meeting at Edgepelick for the Indians at ten and one for the white inhabitants at two. Lucas Gibbs and my wife and I attended. Elizabeth Collins and Hannah Yarnall were there and divers others and the meeting, I believe, were profitable good meeting. Much pertinent counsel was communicated from several.
About the middle of last week a dreadful alarm again. The yellow fever raged again and the people moved away from the city in vast numbers and it has been talked of several weeks but now many conclude to stop going to market.
26. About home.
27. Lucas Gibbs and I went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting. Many worthy Friends from different quarters were there: Nicholas Waln, Samuel Emlen, Christopher Anthony and others. I thought it was a lively favored time. I dined with Christopher at John Hoskins and I thought there was something of the precious life.
28. About home.
29. About 2 pumps at home for George Gange, one 18, the other 14 feet 6 inches long.
31st. At our select meeting, poor time with me, far from being satisfactory it seems to me it is an outside sort of a time.
{1799-09}
1st of the Ninth Month, First Day. At our meeting, came off middling I hope. 
2. Took George Gange’s pump home, all settled. Bro[ugh]t home a load of iron for John.

5. I hewed two pumps for Samuel Davis, one 18 [feet] long the other 29 feet- 6 inches.

18. About a pump for Thomas Porter.
19. At our select meeting at Haddonfield. Chalkley Albertson and Daniel Haviland were there and Sarah Cresen, a young woman, a polished daughter. The meeting was the forepart a low suffering time, but yet these laborers had close searching service. They know our state better from an inward sense and secret intelligence than the reports could inform them. I dined with these Friends at Thomas Thorn’s in conversation.
D.H. informed me that the drought was such that it was thought there would not be above one good ear of corn on four hills in places in their part in New England and that the people knew not what to do with their cattle, not having provender for winter nor grass to fat them at present, and I am told pretty straight and clear that last season in Sussex County the covering of straw was taken off some barns for fodder and that many died for want. A threatening token of cleanness of teeth and want of bread [Amos 4:6].
20. Was our Quarterly Meeting favored with a living ministry. C. Albertson and D. Haviland had hard labor as I thought, with an easy worldly spirit. They much confirmed me in my sense of our state.

22. Was First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. Daniel Haviland and Chalkley Albertson were there and had good service. A vast concourse of people there was.

23. I was with these strangers at Ancocas and Mount Holly meetings, wherein they had open good service.

19. We had a meeting at Edgepelick or Indian Town yesterday. Was very warm. Last evening a shower and clears up cold and windy. The meeting house was very open. We could not be so composed and quiet as might have been if the weather had been more favorable. It was smaller, though I hope to profit.

Solemn matter, good service and Rebekah Brown Elizabeth Collins gave in her account of her visit to Redstone and Virginia in a very affecting manner tendered some to tears. We had some conference about a meeting among the Indians but way did not open in the clearness at that time a great snow storm came on it seemed impracticable.
9. Was First Day. Severe cold winter weather. meeting small and poor and low.
10. My wife and Abigail went to William Rogers on Monthly Meeting business and went to see Thomas Hooton Sr.’s family his wife himself and two sons very unwell.
11. At our meeting. Blamed again for holding meeting half an hour too long * But see William Penn’s <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic> page 351. He mentions a people who spent most part of the day in worshipping God and remember David’s expression, “On thee will I wait all day long.” I got no satisfaction at last: an humbling prospect opened to my view. A fear of a state of dimness and dryness which hath happened to many who have been raised to great attainments. O may the prospect humble me and make me more watchful and weighty in all places where ever I go. Is not this the want of watchfulness humility and weightiness the very cause of dimness and dwarfishness and dryness in religion?
[Left marginal note] *See Psalms 69:3 my throat is dried mine eyes fail while I wait.
The rest of this week I was very closely engaged making a washing machine for the women. A very stormy time snow and rain and severe cold. 16 was First Day at our meeting. Severe cold winter weather. meeting very poor. Shut up time.

[Right marginal note] He then stood fair in society but soon sorrowfully fell into disgrace.

11. Was at our monthly meeting. Forepart was pretty well and satisfactory but I have for some time past feared a right spirit is not prevalent in transacting our business. It seems to me to be done in too outside superficial a manner. <note resp="transcr">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, April 1800. "John Hunt returned to this Meeting the Minute of concurrence granted last month and reported that he had been favored to accomplish the service therein in prospect to good satisfaction."</note>

See a new edition of <italic>Piety Promoted</italic> by Thomas Wagstaffe, page 193, <note resp="transcr">Thomas Wagstaffe, Piety Promoted, in Brief Memorials and Dying Expressions of Some of the People Called Quakers: the ninth part. London: James Phillips, 1796.</note>  concerning Dorothy Owen. The sweet savor of her zealous humble meek example and her dedication of time faculties and property (though in low circumstances) to the glory of God and the good of her fellow creatures had a powerful tendency to enforce the doctrine she preached. She was remarkable for her diligence in the attendance of meetings for worship and discipline from which neither distance nor weather kept her back: while of ability and she frequently went near forty miles on foot in that mountainous country to attend the monthly meeting even when the inclemency of weather rendered it not only difficult but dangerous. 
<pb id="A0011522_101"/>
She contented herself with the least expensive manner of living and dress, in order to have the more to distribute to the necessities of others. Tenderly sympathizing with the poor inhabitants around her and so bright was her example that one not in profession with us declared her conduct preaches daily to me.
Her last illness was lingering and painful which she bore with exemplary patience and was eminently favored with divine peace so as sensibly to gather the minds of those who visited her, into a sense of the same blessed influence. Her prospect of future happiness was unclouded, and she said very near the conclusion the arms of divine mercy are wide open to receive me, aged 42 years a minister 19. Same book page 174 Sarah Tailor’s words. I was never more sensible than in this time of my confinement and separation from my friends of the various ways in which the Lord’s work is marred and his merciful design with respect to individuals frustrated, through the reluctance of the creature to become as passive clay in the hands of the potter vessels of the Lord’s own forming without any mixture. Some hesitate some are too forward but all this is from unreduced self and all tends to mar the Lord’s work. We are to be formed into pure vessels, quite emptied that the divine word may have free course. No hesitation no activity or contrivance or the creature to choose or refuse etc. etc. and in page 182 she says after expression of suffering on account of deliberating too long in some large meetings and thereby increased here own portion of sorrow and conflict: and the cause suffered and the circulation of life obstructed etc. She says O what an awful thing is [Inserted above: here] gospel ministry. How few understand or are sufficiently baptized into the true nature and spirit of pure living gospel ministry. See Seneca’s <italic>Morals</italic> Chapter XV page 174 titled the Blessing of Temperance and moderation. <note resp="transcr">Seneca, A New Translation of the Morals of Seneca.

15th of the Fourth Month 1800. Was our weekday meeting. I unwell not able to attend.
Got a little better. Was at work at a machine for Joseph Warrington several days.
19th of the Fourth Month 1800. I went to select meeting at Philadelphia where there was a good number of the first rate or class in society. Some were yea many were as lights in the world as the salt of the earth and as a city set on a hill like as brilliant stars of the first magnitude engaged to labor to turn many to righteousness. These it is said shall shine as stars forever and ever. There were a number of this description: who for Zion’s sake cannot be silent and for Jerusalem’s sake cannot hold their peace until they see her righteousness go forth as brightness and her salvation as a lamp that burneth amongst these valiants were. Richard Jordan and my kinsman Nathan Hunt, son of William, from North Carolina. Daniel Haviland and Daniel Dean from the State of New York and many others from different quarters. The meeting was an instructing solemn time. Some testimonies from those of Carolina I thought deserved to be transmitted to the latest generation: but I had not time to make any memorandums. I thought some of these worthies kept their places to a notch some named or called one of them perfection [inserted: "but he sorrowfully fell D. Dean]. On Second Day my wife, daughter Abigail and son John came and we all attended till the conclusion of the meeting Sixth Day evening. Some settings forepart of the week were to me very hard and trying I was lift so poor I was ready to wish myself at home if I dared but it growed better. Both as to body and mind I having been very poorly and some settings were distinguishedly favored solemn instructing settings great unanimity and order were for the most part preserved. Got home on Seventh Day. Had in the course of the week several precious opportunities in families: one at Elizabeth Coulk’s, one at Sarah Cresson’s, one at Francis Nesbet’s and at William Ashby’s with some precious young friends from Nantucket. My Friends owned me beyond my expectation. Our beloved cousin Nathan Hunt and his companion Barnaby Coffin are going eastward; Samuel Smith of Philadelphia and Richard Jordan to Europe. 
<pb id="A0011522_102"/>
John Parrish, Richard Jordan and I had an opportunity and conference with one of the Congressmen belonging to the State of Georgia concerning slavery to some profit I hope.

28. About home at work at a machine for brother Joseph Warrington.
29. At our meeting. Isaac Everat from Huntington was there and was favored to speak very closely to the state of the meeting. His testimony was against an indolent spirit. He that is slothful in business is brother to him that is a great waster and again as I walk by the field of the slothful etc.  <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 24:30</note> .
I went with him to the Schoolhouse Meeting this afternoon where he had close searching service. Yet to a remnant very encouraging we counted him a very wise man a father in Israel.
The rest of this week till Seventh Day about home finishing a machine for Joseph Warrington. Unwell. Seventh Day was our select meeting. Forepart to me was low and poor but ended lively and to my relief and some satisfaction.

Then I mended William Snowden’s pump. All settled then home.

Cox and John Cox and Job Cowst talked to me about after meeting but I don’t know but I have been spoken to forty times on that account [notation] hesitating and holding meeting too long.

[23rd 8th Month, 1806] Everything we here enjoy changes, decays and comes to an end. The indulgence of harsh dispositions is the introduction of future misery.  Remember Trout[?] Haman all availed him nothing w[cut off]: Disturb in mind and hoss[?] t[cut off] Ended.
Gentleness is in truth the great avenue to mutual enjoyment 
[inserted above] Great said David
24th 8th Month 1806. Although we have had a very fruitful season here in our parts vast plenty of apples, pears, cherries, fruit of every kind, watermelons, cucumbers so plenty and cheap in market that they would not pay the expense of taking there and abundance thrown away a very mortifying time to the truck mongers or truck merchants the like was never known in such vast plenty I don’t doubt but many wagon loads of watermelons and cucumbers will be thrown away. They are in such vast plenty in our Jersey land and a very good harvest for rye and wheat and the greatest prospect of a vast great crop of Indian corn and buckwheat that ever was known yet I am told by eye witnesses that a little below Salem they have had a pinching time of drought so that a few weeks ago they could rub the corn leaves to snuff,  and  a Friend who lately traveled through New England Isaac C. Jones told me a great drought prevailed through that part of the country eastward especially in province of Maine so called. The drought is mentioned in the newspapers very piercing indeed in the time of this dry weather the fire broke out the wind being very high and raged to a great degree spread over and consumed a great part of the country burnt up and destroyed, many settlements so that many great farmers who had lived in affluence and plenty were now by that means reduced to poverty and want being burnt out of house and home.
See William Edmundson’s <italic>Journal </italic>an account of a time of great scarcity which was soon succeeded [by] a time of great plenty which was made known to him and he had to prophecy foretell and forewarn the people and told the people the Lord would lash them with his judgment and dung [?] the ground with the carcasses of men which shortly after soon came to pass,  and many died for want of bread and tuffs of rank green grass were seen on the common where carcasses of people had dunged the ground and s[missing] his prophecy was fulfilled.
[Marginal note, written sideways] 1807 John Haines traveling in new England this summer says they have had no harvest over a great part of that country the winter and Insects destroyed their wheat that they made bread without bottling their meal,  bran and all together and would allow but ten pound of hay a night for a horse.

Sentiment
One act of triumph over the temper is worth a million of triumphs over our fellow creatures and the perfect dominion of our mind is more advantageous and laudable than the dominion over provinces and nations the one attaches merely our corporal part and is buried with us in the dust in the grave the other follows our immortal part and passes with it into eternity.

As said the poet:
He is more a prince that rules himself
Than he whom nations keeps in awe,
Who yields to that which doth their souls convince
Shall never need another law
He that ruleth his spirit is stronger than he
That taketh a city: he that ruleth not his
Spirit is like to a city whose walls are broken
Down and without strength: says Solomon

21st [5th day] of the 1st Month, 1808. Having the approbation of Friends <note resp="transcr">Chester Monthly Meeting minutes, January 1808: “John Hunt opened a prospect of visiting some of the meetings of friends within the limits of Mington and Bucks Quarter in Pennsylvania as way might open, which, upon deliberation, was concurred with, and he left at liberty to proceed therein, being a minister in good esteem with us. The Clk. Is directed to furnish him with a copy of this minute and sign it on behalf of the meeting.”</note>  I left home to visit some meetings in Bucks and Abington quarters [in] Pennsylvania. Got to Mount Holly Meeting on Fifth Day which was very poor, low, little to be done. Here I met Hinchman Hains of Gabriel Daviss. Sixth Day had an appointed meeting for H.H. [Hinchman Haines] at Crosswicks. He took up almost the whole time and was much favoured. In the evening had a meeting at Bordentown. The few Friends there the house was crowded full and the weight fell on me and I believe it ended to general satisfaction. A Methodist minister was there and came to our lodging and said he wanted some friendly religious discourse with us and we parted friendly and respectfully he expressing great love and friendship for us.  7th Day had a meeting at Trenton. Religion seemed to be at a low ebb and hard getting along though. I hope we came off without loss. This evening I got to my friend Jonathan Kirkbride’s.  My companions went on pursuant to their prospect down the river.
[24] 1st Day I was at the Falls Meeting which was an owning favored time I believe to general satisfaction.
[25] 2nd. Had an appointed meeting at Makefield and I hope and believe in a good degree owning. Got to Oliver Paxton’s to lodge. Third Day got to John Balderston's. 
[left marginal note]  Stop to see an old man in a deep consumption. He was very tender. 
[26] [crossed out] 4th Day. And were at Solebury Meeting 
[27] Fourth Day at Buckingham Preparative Meeting -- middling. 
[28] 5 Day. Plumsted Preparative. A very stormy snowy day. The meeting was very small and things seemed low we had but a poor time. Lodged at Edward Good’s.
[29] 6 Day [inserted] an appointed meeting. We went to Richland Meeting fifteen miles in a sleigh. The roads very bad and crossing the creeks very difficult and dangerous, the waters high and ice not quite strong enough to bear the horses.
We had some dismal discouraging dangerous places to go through but were favoured to get safe along in good season starting before sunrise and a full favoured owning open time it was I believe to general satisfaction. Came back to Edward Good’s to lodge. Had a sitting with them for the better I hope. Had an opportunity at Robert Kirkbride's sons family in a disunited state to satisfaction 
<pb id="A0011525_002"/>
[30] 7th Day. On our way we stopped at a school for the better I believe and stopped to see old Peter Vickers and family.  His daughter and he being in a poor, low, afflicted condition. Had a little setting with them and it seemed very acceptable to them. Got to John Balderston’s about noon. 
31 was First Day. Went to Wrightstown meeting which was large and  an owning open time I believe to general good satisfaction. Got to our kind Friend’s William Blake to lodge. We have had fine winter, moderate weather some days but now a stormy morning. 
[Left Margin] Went to see an ancient widow in affliction which very acceptable to her as she expressed.
{1808-02}
2nd Month 1st. At Middletown Meeting, not very large. The roads stormy. I believe the meeting ended solid and to general satisfaction. 
[3] 3rd Day. Had a meeting appointed at Bristol, the roads very heavy traveling. Not a very full meeting but in a good degree favoured. [crossed out] 4th Day 
Lodged at William Walton’s. Had a good time in the evening.
[3] 4 day. Got to the Select Meeting at Abington and were owned and preserved. Dined at Charles William’s and had an open favored time. After dinner went to Jacob Paxton to lodge and there William Blake my companion called their large family of children together in the evening for the better I hope and believe.
[4] 5 Day. Was Quarterly Meeting at Abington. Some stirrings of life but things did not rise as I could wish though got some relief at last in the women’s meeting. Lodged at Jared Spencer’s with divers choice Friends of Richland. Had an opportunity with the family and a number of young people in the evening later for the better I hope and believe.
[5] 6 Day. Went to an appointed meeting at Horsham which was large and an highly favoured open owning time it was I believe to general satisfaction, very pleasant and full of love. Friends seemed to be a parting under a lively sense of the ownings of truth.
<pb id="A0011525_003"/>
[6] 7 Day night. Got to my cousin Hanncy Yarnal’s to lodge. Visited John Comly's boarding school of young women, most of them not of our society and very gay and fashionable. When the ground is not prepared the hopes of the sower is but small. Not much sign of entrance through a door of utterance, not much satisfaction amongst their school of lads.
10. Was First Day. At Byberry Meeting which was large and open and I hope to general satisfaction as far as I could discover they were very loving and inviting after meeting though I had not that satisfaction as at some other places. We don’t always get our pay as soon as we have done our work but now and then a rarity or a downright good satisfactory meeting.
11. Lodged at cousin James Thorington’s after a sweet time amongst the children and family. In the morning cousin James brought me over the river to cousin Benjamin Warrington’s.
This meeting at Horsham was a memorable time (for about an hour and a half). William Blakey said when we came out this is the best meeting I ever seen at this place this is the cap sheaf this crowns all. <note resp="transcr">Chester Monthly Meeting minutes, February 1808: “John Hunt returned the minute granted him at last meeting and reported he has performed the visit then in prospect much to his satisfaction.”</note> 
Jacob Paxson said I wish I had got more of my children along; pleasantness sweetness and feeling nearness was felt to abound

{1812-07}
8th of the Seventh Month, 1812, Fourth Day of the week. We went to the burial of our dear sister-in-law Rebecca Warrington aged about 78. A savor of life and sweet solemnity attended. David Comfort a young man had something savory to communicate. She has been an innocent, tender, kind friend to all: had the care of bringing up many orphan children who always esteemed her as a mother, escaped the pollutions that are in the world was resigned and willing to leave it, and is gathered as a shock of corn in its season. Now in the midst of harvest time: though the  smaller than common.
9. Was our monthly meeting which I thought was a lively savory satisfactory time. Had the epistle read from our yearly meeting on which was made many lively remarks. Now in the midst of harvest. Our meetings small. People work hard in the heat and are hardly in a state fit to go to meeting.
15. Nathan Smith came to see us. 
16. He went with us to our meeting and had very acceptable service. 
17. N[athan] S[mith] went with me to Cropwell Meeting. Although very small I believe was favored in a good degree. Went to see my old friend Joshua Lippincott. Now we were getting in our harvest rye and wheat; favored with a very good crop, never better or more of it, scarcely a very fine harvest in general though the hail has cut down the rye in divers places. 
18. Nathan Smith and I went to Mount Holly. Lodged at Obadiah Ingles.
19. First Day morning. We went to see Aguila Shinn about 73 who has been some time in a low discouraged disconsolate state of mind and we had a satisfactory time with him and he went to their meeting with us which was an open owning favored time in a distinguished manner. Evidently helped. We stayed [for] their afternoon meeting which was small and very trying to me being very feeble and over wearied but Elizabeth Kirk and Sarah Pope came in and they and Nathan all had lively service and at last I ventured and was helped beyond expectation so we left Mount Holly with good satisfaction and left Aquilla Shinn seemingly much better and came home to my house in the evening. 
[marginal note] A heavy thundershower at [Mount] Holly, none here.
19. Second Day. Went to the burial of John Kaighn at Moorestown, a wealthy man. Deborah Stewart had something to say at the house and John Cox at the grave. Pretty forcible but yet not much animation among the people. Very busy getting hay, oats etc.
23. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting very small dull low and poor. J.C. expressed his anxious concern about it. I was forced to work and weary amongst the hay.
25. I went to mill at Haddonfield. Afternoon I went to the burial of Ruth Higby formerly our near neighbor near eighty years of age. I was over wearied though had something to say at the grave and some satisfaction: yet things low. As to the savor of life and ownings of truth, people seem to have very little thought of seeking after it or laboring for it. No wonder poverty prevails: they that will not work neither shall they eat said Paul <note resp="transcr">2 Thessalonians 3:10</note>  .
26. First Day. At our meeting and a favored open, owning, strengthening time it was to me, the like I have not seen there a great while. Behold he knoweth the way that I take etc. This week very busy getting hay. Favored to get along better than I could expect.
[Marginal note, edge of page worn away] Dry time with us here no shower round [indecipherable] near [indecipherable] and some [indecipherable] rain here.
Fifth Day. At our meeting some life stirring. Ann Edward appeared lively as some thought and R.C. who has been shut up in meetings above two years and myself something with them. Meeting but small.
{1812-08}
2 of Eighth Month. First Day. At our meeting but low to me. If the dead rise not preaching is vain. <note resp="transcr">I Corinthians 15:15-17</note>  Very busy getting hay and I was favored to work and help considerably.
6. Was Monthly Meeting, a pretty lively time considering and conferring on the case of spirituous liquors. Finished getting in our hay, oats and I have been favored to get through with it beyond all expectation. Our barn and hay house seldom, if ever better, filled whilst we hear of dreadful scarcity in divers places in Europe. Twenty of a day they say dropping down dead for want of bread.
9. First Day. At our meeting George Gibbins a very lively hopeful young minister of Philadelphia was there and had very acceptable service. Though the waters seemed low a fine soaking shower after about four weeks’ drought which seemed to threaten the cutting of the Indian corn, buckwheat and potatoes, etc.
<pb id="A0011526_003"/>
10th of the Eighth Month, 1812. I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. A rainy showery day both outwardly and spiritually. Richard Jordan had most excellent service. A celestial shower in a lively powerful manner; he did pour it on us, but as one formerly prophesied, the time would come when there should be powerful preachers and dull hearers. So it seems to be in our days the hearts and minds of the people are like the inn of old that was filled with other guests. So it run through my mind a want of a concern, a want of right religious concern etc. Can anything be done in religion or the work of the soul’s salvation without a concern? The faithful servants of the Lord never laid up treasure in heaven without experiencing a deep and weighty concern etc. Richard Jordan’s testimony was very lively and delivered with great force and strength. He mentioned something he had seen in his travels of the scarcity of bread; and said they that had never seen it, could hardly conceive how grievous and dreadful a calamity it was. And we have of latter time frequently heard of the great scarcity and want of bread. 
[marginal note] Where grievous wars have long prevailed in divers European nations so that man drop down dead for want of bread as it is said in a day in some cities. Read the 28 chapter of Deuteronomy. 
11. Our son Joseph from Fallowfield was here. Benne and John, Abbe, and Hannah all our children were here together once more. Joseph came to bring over a crazy young man, Reuben Haines, who had his skull cracked at play, what they call long bullets <note resp="transcr">“Long Bullets” a possible reference to the game where an iron ball or a stone is rolled along a roadway. The team that covers the stated distance in the fewest number of throws wins the game.</note>  and is raving distracted; a dismal scene of sorrow 
12. I went to Haddonfield Mill though very poorly.
13. Fifth Day. At our meeting shut up in silence. Exceeding poor and destitute of life. I was very poorly and afflicted with a bad boil wearied over much could hardly sit.
16. First Day. I find in an old bit of a newspaper this account. Curacao sunk. Captain Stevens, arrived at Boston, says it was reported at St. Domingo that the whole island of Curacao and part of Bonaire was sunk by an earthquake on the 9 of February with all the vessels in the harbor, among which was a vessel from London with a cargo worth 200,000 dollars. As one day goes another comes, and sometimes shews us dismal dooms. Yea is it not so oft times in many instances: a man with his wagon between Haddonfield and the ferry has his leg badly broke by the kick of his horse this week. It is a time of great confusion and divisions amongst the people of America: see our epistle from our last Yearly Meeting. And when you see divisions and parties and rendings in the bowels of nations and rumors and tempests in the minds of the people then take heed of being moved to this party or that party etc. Very excellent pertinent council and never perhaps more needed. One of the politicians said division is death. United we stand, divided we fall. As we read a house divided against itself cannot stand <note resp="transcr">Matthew 12:25</note> . 
This party spirit between Federalists and Democrats as they are called has now got to a very great height. Some lives have been lost, divers killed in a tumult lately at Baltimore where they destroyed a printing press. And all this about the form of government. Father against son and son against father and brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor. Some who a few years ago were as intimate as brothers now so divided they can have no dealings together and this party spirit has got in amongst us and some who fill conspicuous stations. And after all there never was any law form of government or discipline ever contrived by men so calculated for the safety, peace and happiness of mankind as the Christian religion, and can anything else restore things again to the right order? My wife and I went to Cropwell meeting and an open satisfactory time it was. Friends were very free open kind and inviting after meeting, an unmerited favor. We dined at our kinsman Joseph Rogers, heard of a dreadful accident [at] Haddonfield. Seventh Day evening a company of men met to exercise and some [indecipherable] playing with their guns loaded only with powder. One by the name of Wells [indecipherable] fired of his gun close under another's face to scare him. Another by the name of [indecipherable] was just there the [indecipherable] of the gun and it tore his brains out with the [indecipherable].
<note resp="transcr">Bottom portion of the manuscript is worn away.</note>

[marginal note] We hear of a woman near Germantown being suddenly killed by a horse taking fright. The wheels, for want of care, in meeting a wagon struck, frightened the horse in the chair, and he run away and threw the woman against a tree and killed her instantly. People notice these things a little but soon forget them.
<pb id="A0011526_004"/>
20 Eighth Month, 1812. Fifth Day. A very rainy morning. We have had much wet cloudy weather near two weeks past. Several not got all their oats and hay in. Since the Revolution and commencement of peace great hath been the growth of pride and high-mindedness not only in superfluity of dress but in building, furniture of houses and more especially in carriages. As it was said formerly, see Isaiah 2 chapter, their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots; and their land also is full of idols they worship the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made. So it is to be feared that this is really the case with the people of America in the present day in too general a way and now see what is the fruits and effects of such doings why all going into party spirits wars and confusion. As it was formerly said, they shall all go into confusion together that are makers of idols. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 45:16</note>  See Jeremiah 2: 17- 19 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God when he led thee by the way? Thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in saith the Lord God of Hosts.
At our meeting a poor low mortifying time to me. A want of clothing about home. Very much wet weather heavy showers, a fine growing time.
Seventh Day Evening. I went with my old friend Joshua Lippincott his daughter Hannah and Deborah Steward to Nathaniel Lippincott's son of Joshua.
23 First Day. We had a meeting at 10 hour at Gloucester County poorhouse. Upwards of fifty there. Many poor distressed objects, some blind, some deaf, some dumb and many very lame, very ancient, feeble [Crossed out: lame] and very decrepit. They behaved very orderly and divers were very tender and expressed thankfulness for our visiting them, one remarkably so at parting. Though dumb or could not talk so as to be understood and I believe the meeting was in some good degree favored and to general satisfaction.
[marginal note] He could not have showed more love at parting with his nearest relations.   
Some of their neighbors came to it. Deborah Stewart had very acceptable service. Dined at N. Lippincott's at 3 hour this afternoon; we had a meeting at their schoolhouse and a favored, open, owning time. I believe it was to general satisfaction.
[24.] Second Day. After mending two pumps for N[athaniel].L[ippincott]I got well home. It is remarkable the unusual number of accidents we hear of at this time: a pamphlet giving an account of a confession of a woman murdering her mother and was hanged for it in Sussex County, New Jersey. A woman was throwed off a chair against a tree near Germantown and killed instantly. A man dancing fell down dead instantly one Wescot towards Egg Harbor. James Hale, about seventy, cut his throat near Haddonfield. He had supported a good character an innocent, industrious man had raised up a family of children. Some of them brought trouble on him in his old age and other cross occurrences. He thus ended his days though always lived above want. A black man running a horse was throwed and broke his leg and cracked his skull so that his life is much despaired of near Moorestown.
Chiefly about home this week.
[27.] Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting, low, poor, and dull.
30. First Day. At our meeting, a mortifying time to me. No satisfaction but very far from it. Oh the ups and downs we poor creatures have to meet with. James Simson said his misses had done him more good than his hits. it’s not in man that walketh to direct his steps <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 10:23</note>   but the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord <note resp="transcr">Psalms 37:23</note> . A wounding time to me.
{1812-09}
Fifth Day. At our meeting: silent, small, poor and low. No life amongst us that I could find.
6. Our select meeting. A very rainy stormy morning so that I could not go to it. We hear of dreadful accounts of the wars amongst the Indians and whites. It is said the Indians have killed 300 and further dreadful accounts amongst the warlike people. 
[marginal note] It is said the Indians have taken captive a thousand whites. Heard of the death of Joshua Maule, but a middle age, a minister in great esteem. He was visiting meetings near Byberry had appointed two meetings was taken ill of a fever and died suddenly and also heard of the death of Eli Yarnal, middle aged, a great minister in good esteem. He and his son by the name of Eli both died with a short illness with what the doctors call a typhus fever. Oh, the many solemn awful [indecipherable] divers ways and manners they seem a little noticed but [indecipherable].
<pb id="A0011526_005"/>
Except it is to the righteous it is not so to them: they can say with Paul of old I have fought the good fight <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 4:7</note>  , etc. And again, oh death, where is thy sting, oh grave, where is thy victory <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:55</note>   And as another said although I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil <note resp="transcr">Psalms 23:4</note>  . And as Habakkuk said though the fields yield no meat yet will I rejoice in the Lord <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17-18</note>  , etc. A blessed glorious state worthy above all other concerns to be cared for, and yet so it is though it seems strange the generality of people seem so unconcerned about it till at last then as divers have said ten thousands of worlds would I give if I had it in my power for peace with God. Oh, that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end, etc. Then as William Penn remarks, the cry is a world of gold and of pearl for a little more time and all that they might use it better, etc. The cry is generally what shall I do Lord, help wretched man that I am. Who shall deliver me? A savior, or I die; a redeemer, or I perish. 
[marginal note] It is said the news give an account of a man murdering his wife and some others of his nearest relations in Pennsylvania.
6 and 7 Day. Great rain and heavy thunder. We heard a few weeks ago of a man with a team (in Pennsylvania not far from Byberry) was killed with the thunder and several of his horses and two colts killed with the thunder near the ferries. And one John Wills in Philadelphia last week, middle aged, very fat and corpulent. Went to bed as well as usual and his wife found him dead in the morning. She discovered nothing amiss in the night and many such instances there are of the uncertainty of time and sudden transitions from time to eternity. We know not whither at midnight, cock's crow or the dawning of the day. There is but one way to come into the world but many ways to go out of it. We come into the world naked and bare: we travel through it with trouble and care: we go out of it nobody knows where; but if we do well here we shall fare well there <note resp="transcr">The verse beginning “We come into the world…” attributed to John Edwin (1749-1790).</note>  ;  as was said to Cain if thou dost well shalt thou not be accepted <note resp="transcr">Genesis 4:7</note> , etc. But oh, who? It is to be feared too few enough consider the importance of that of acceptance or know how to set a price upon it. Is not the price of it far above rubies? Does not all happiness depend upon it?
[marginal note] John Gibbins drowned in the river near Burlington. Left a family of children.
1812, 6 of the Ninth Month, First Day. My wife and daughter and I went to Evesham meeting and had no cause to repent being there. Although there did not appear to be that savor and sweetness as at some other times yet not much cause of complaint. Dined and spent the afternoon with our son John’s.
Third Day. William Blakey of Pennsylvania appointed a meeting [at] Westfield and sent word to me desiring I would meet him there, which I did. I thought he did very well and that there was something quieting, calming and savory but alas, meetings are become cheap and line upon line, precept upon precept and plenty makes dainty. And life and power much wanting. In the beginning the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost was frequently felt amongst friends at meeting.
[marginal note] Dined with my dear friend William Blakey at J. [indecipherable] Lippincott. He went then to Vincentown.
Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting although something lively and pretty well yet it was not altogether satisfactory to me. More of that humility and fear which keeps the heart clean and is a fountain of life that preserves from the snare of death, upon retrospection, I thought was wanting. Charity suffers long and is kind <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 13:4</note> , something of it wanting in my zeal against a selfish, covetous hard dealing spirit that loves to buy cheap and sell dear. When thou buyest ought of thy neighbor or sellest ought to thy neighbor ye shall not oppress one another. Again thou hast dealt by oppression; thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbor by extortion. Can thine heart endure or thine hands be strong in the day that I shall deal with thee <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 22:14</note>  ? A spirit very prevalent in this our day: although extortion in Scripture is ranked amongst the blackest of crimes yet it is become so common that it is hardly thought to be any harm or crime at all, and even amongst us a people professing to great refinement but it is so contrary to love and unity that can an extortioner lay any claim to charity without which as the apostle says, all is nothing without a spirit I have ever abhorred. And my zeal against it sometimes too warm, but such is the power of custom that from Scripture accounts. Amongst the Sodomites and in the days of Phinehas, and Babel Pear and some ages and nations since, whoredom was so customary a thing amongst them that it was thought little or no crime at all – such is the power of custom.
[marginal note] 10 of Ninth Month. William Blakey told me Joshua Maule died near his house and that the doctors said his disorder was entirely like the Yellow Fever.
13. First Day. I am but poorly. Yesterday had a fit of the chill and fever but now better.
Sixth Day, 18 of Ninth Month now very weak and poorly having had the chill or shaking ague and fever every other day since last Seventh Day. Although those fits of ague and fever are dread for several hours, yet they have gone off so that I have been pretty easy, which is a great favor and mercy.
<pb id="A0011526_006"/>
17th of the Ninth Month, 1812. Was our quarterly meeting at Haddonfield, but I was so poorly I could not go to it. My wife and daughter, Hannah, informs me that Richard Jordan and Thomas Scattergood took up about an hour apiece and had exceeding lively service. Richard spoke much to the people about their coming to meeting in such an easy trifling, indifferent unconcern a manner. Thomas reminded them of the striping times about thirty years ago when some had scarcely a cow or hoof left on their farm, and Richard appeared in prayer at last in a powerful manner. As we read in Scripture formerly so through continued mercy it is to this day also I set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet: but they said we will not hearken <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 6:17</note>   and is not this the language of conduct with many at this day. As it was said to the prophet Ezekiel, they come before thee as the people cometh, they sit before thee as my people, they hear thy words but will not do them. Thy words are to them as a pleasant song of one that hath a pleasant voice so each one returns to their covetousness <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33: 31-32</note>  . So the great end of gospel ministry is not answered in bringing about the desired reformation.
20 Ninth Month, First Day. I poorly not able to go out though some better.
21. Missed my fit of the ague and fever mercifully favored.
22. Heard of the death of Susannah Dudley, a young woman who went to Egg Harbor for her health, growed worse and died there and they brought her home dead. [She] was buried yesterday at Evesham. And also heard of the death of Samuel Cooper about seventy or a little younger than myself. An old schoolmate, he owned the ferry and although he had great possessions, was vastly rich, he retired from business, obtained a right amongst Friends became a much improved man and was very helpful, open-hearted and kind in entertaining friends and their horses and its likely will be very much missed: repeated calls to old and young. Anne Mifflin came to see me and shewed me a letter she received from her son who is traveling in the back countries, Ohio etc., informs that there was there very great alarms for fear of the Indians that he saw families fleeing from their habitations in almost every direction. Children that was big enough to travel has a bundle to carry, and that some they met would flee into the woods and hide and could hardly be persuaded that their fears were groundless and the alarms false, although it appeared it really was so.
[marginal note] This alarm Thomas Frinch living at Ohio told me was caused by a great number of soldiers who had been defeated and then passed homeward through their country from Detroit where the battle was and a great number taken prisoners.
But the case was doleful however false the alarms might be. There was such false alarms here in the time of the wars: many fled and hid and great to do there was hiding provisions, cloths and goods, etc. But indeed life and property did seem often to be in a very uncertain precarious situation at that time. It was said that time 1774 many of our young men had fled to Cedar swamps etc. to hide themselves and some have fled now, see Jeremiah 4:29 verse: the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they shall go into thickets and shall climb up upon the rocks every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein, and see Ezekiel 13:12 and Hosea 10:13.
24, Fifth [Day] of the week. At our preparative meeting shut up in silence small poor and low. I was so poorly feeble and weak I could not sit the last. It was more than my strength and state of health could bear yet.
28 First Day I ventured to go again and a highly favored, open, owning, strengthening time it was, more so than many months past. An invitation to the burial of Sarah Wilkins, a choice innocent, sweet, acceptable minister, has traveled a pretty deal visiting families has been very diligent. Lately had a severe spell of sickness but got out some weeks or months past and was since twice at our meeting. And heard that George Brown, a wealthy man, had his arm shot almost off at the river, a very deaf man. And the burial of two children spoke of died with the flux in Moorestown, where several have lately died with it
[marginal note] Doctors they say meet today to see about cutting G. Brown’s arm off. 
29 Eleventh Month. G.B. like to get well. 
<pb id="A0011526_007"/>
Between thirty and forty years ago I was with Joshua Evans visiting families in the compass of Evesham and Upper Evesham. I remember well the sitting at William and Sarah Wilking’s. Going about from house to house it seemed to me it was like endeavoring to lift soldiers; and my mind was turned particularly towards Sarah, although there had not then appeared in her much of a religious concern. Yet she soon after came forward and a faithful valiant soldier and laborer she has been. She is to [be] buried this day. 
29 Ninth Month 1812. I very poorly confined.
{1812-10}
1 of the Tenth Month. Fifth Day. I am so poorly I did not get out to meeting.
[marginal note] [2.] Jno. Collins and wife set off to Redstone.
4 First Day I got out to our meeting. Again it was smaller than common and silent as to me. Though not the poorest as to myself yet it seemed to me a very low poor time A. Edwards appeared yet but little if any animation.
8. Was our Monthly Meeting pretty middling well though not altogether satisfactory. Last Fourth Day my wife and daughter Abigail went and fetched our sister Hannah Buzby here.
10. Went to see our son Benjamin and his family and then called to see Samuel Laning and his wife, she having been blind several years. Both old and stricken in years. Then we went to cousin Benjamin Warrington’s to lodge.
11. Was First Day. We went to Westfield meeting and an open satisfactory time it seemed to be tending to strengthen, gather and unite. After meeting I went to see George Browing who lately had his arm shot through. They have hopes he is like to get well. Then went to our cousin Henry Warrington’s whose wife has lately lain in and has been very ill but now better. All this wearying about seemed almost more than I could undergo.
[marginal note] Nothing material of late.
18. First Day. I was afflicted with a very bad boil. Could not go to meeting.
22. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Ann Edwards appeared lively. Although I was very poorly I had a sense I thought that there was something more owning. We have had very fine warm moderate weather till this.
23. A cold storm and some flakes of snow, the first this year though there has been several smart white frosts that killed the corn and a good deal [did] not got [get] hard so like to hurt it. Several of our family, as also myself, have very heavy and I have had a very bad boil and I hear there is pretty much complaint of bad boils with divers others.
[marginal note] much wet weather very great rains.
25. First Day. I was so poorly with a cold I concluded I should not venture out to meeting: but I did get there and was glad I was there. I thought there was an unusual fitness and something salutary and savory to me and open, owning, strengthening and comforting. And healing. the savor remained some days. We read of a people that refused the waters of Shiloh <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 6</note>  , etc. I have often read the passage but it never was opened and illustrated in my view as now for it appeared to be all and all worthy of our chiefest concern, etc.
[29.] Fifth Day. I was at meeting again but I had exposed myself too much and had taken a heavy cold and had something of the ague again. A.E. was lively.
[marginal note] Weather fine.
{1812-11}
1 of Eleventh Month, First Day. I very poorly. Did not get to meeting. Weather fine and moderate about getting in our corn and saving stalks, and although I am so poorly and weak we were favored to get through beyond all expectation. With the children and an old black man with very little other help finished. Seventh Day storm comes on. Last Fifth Day at our Monthly Meeting in a good degree satisfactory to me. Your old men shall dream dreams so we read. A few nights ago I had a remarkable dream I thought I was speaking to a vast, great concourse of people and with a sensation of great animation, life and power far greater than I ever experienced. And what seemed the most animating was I thought the people were gathering and flocking to me in a wonderful, lively, zealous manner as if all would come. The feeling sense that attended did me good and seemed strengthening some days.
7. First Day. At our meeting a low time and silent. Waters so low I dare not venture, poorly several days sorting of the ague again. I can not bear the cold.
[marginal note] Dream.
<pb id="A0011526_008"/>
15. Eleventh Month, 1812, First Day. I am very feeble and poorly could not go out. They inform me Enoch Walker was at our meeting and had acceptable service this week. Confined mostly to the house. Did not go to our meeting. Have had a very hard asthmatic cough.
22. First Day. I got out to our meeting again though hardly able to sit. Elizabeth Collins and Joseph Matlack were there and had considerable to say but I thought the waters seemed very low, though Elizabeth appeared in prayer at last and was favored. Savor and life attended; and it ended well and savory.
23. I hear our brother-in-law William Rogers, my old fellow traveler to Redstone, Ohio, Shrewsbury, Egg Harbor, etc., seemed to be near his end, aged eighty. About a week ago Isaac Peacock was badly scalded with the head of the still bursting off. He immediately jumped into the pond. If he had not done so it is not likely he would have lived an hour: however his life is much despaired of by the doctor yet – see the dismal scenes of sorrow and affliction and how sudden and unexpected they come.
[marginal note] Several weeks dry weather holds moderate.
A few nights ago there was a very tremendous awful hard wind and rain. It blowed down abundance of fence and some trees, took the roofs of some dwellings and outhouses, blowed the sheds at our meetinghouse over and we heard of several that was found drounded in the river: a vessel overset, divers lost. I have been much confined to the house. Cannot bear the cold sometime.
29 Eleventh Month, First Day. A very stormy day. I could not go to meeting. It opened in my mind that to meet together and sit down together as the people did in the days of Ezra the Scribe where we read they sat down by the river Ahavah to inquire of the Lord a right way for them and their little ones to walk in <note resp="transcr">Ezra 8:21</note>   was a most acceptable disposition when and wherever it is done in sincerity: but that it is to be feared sincerity is much wanting, and with many meeting is become a customary thing and treated with trifling indifferency. So poverty, leanness, barrenness and formality abounds.
{1812-12}
1 of the Twelfth Month. Isaac Peacock at Moorestown buried. He has laid about fourteen days after being scalded almost all over with the top of the still bursting off with the steam. Several other burials this week: near us a young man, Levi Lippincott’s son and an old black woman. I have been confined at home. Very much rainy stormy weather.
6 of Twelfth Month, First Day. I went to the burial of our brother-in-law William Rogers, upwards of eighty years of age and was at Evesham meeting. Hinchman Haines had a pretty deal to say but life and power did not seem to rise into dominion. 
7. Daniel Bishop was buried upwards of eighty year of age and Joseph Eves buried a few days ago, upwards of ninety years of age and divers others, four or five round about within a few miles, middle aged.
Very severe freezing cold weather. I have been confined at home. Cannot bear cold although somewhat recruited and better in health.
13 of the Twelfth Month, First Day. Although the weather very cold I got to our meeting and an open, owning, strengthening, healing time it seemed to be to me. Friends expressed gladness to see me out again and not burdened yet not so with all I find although I fear there is great want of an individual labor which makes hard work.
[marginal note] weather fine and moderate.
16. I got out to our select meeting at Evesham. Thomas Lowrey of Salem had very acceptable service and there seemed something owning comfortable amongst us. 
17. Was our quarterly meeting. Richard Jordan had excellent service afternoon. Near the close I had a small share in the labor to good satisfaction. 
6 and 7 Day. I was making a meat tub for Joseph Rogers although I make but a very pottering hand at work.
[marginal note] moderate fine weather.
20 First Day. Richard Jordan mentioned a very remarkable convincement in the north of England of a man very great in military affairs and was then expecting to soon take an admiral’s commission fell in company with him and others at dinner where they took a solemn pause in silence and this great warrior was so reached that he burst into tears and from that time laid down all his weapons of war and he said not a word spoken at dinner.
<pb id="A0011526_009"/>
24 Twelfth Month 1812. At our preparative meeting, very small silent low and poor. My state of health is a good deal better though the cold pinches me and it has been very freezing dry and not windy several weeks past. Our cousin Hannah Yarnal and her daughter here to see us.
27. Was First Day. At our meeting. Hannah Yarnal had considerable to say and Elizabeth Balderston here but she was silent. She is engaged in visiting families in the compass of our Monthly Meeting. I thought there was something of a savory quiet yet but low time. 
Fifth Day. At our meeting, small, shut up and very low and poor although Abel Thomas of Pennsylvania had a meeting the Third Day before and had very acceptable service. One of an unblemished character about 78 years of age, a great traveler.
{1813-01}
Sixth Day 1st of the First Month 1813. I went to Cropwell meeting, very small waters very low. I was unwell but came off middling satisfactory.
[marginal note] moderate weather.
Seventh Day. Killing hogs. Got done before the rain came on much. Very rainy afternoon.
3rd First Day. Weather very cold and high wind and did not get out to meeting. Elizabeth Balderston was there our children say and had acceptable service.
Second Day Elizabeth Balderston, Ebenezer Roberts, John Matlack and Rebecca Cowperthaite were here in the course of their family visiting. Something owning and satisfactory.
[marginal note] Very cold and high wind.
3 and 4. About home.
[marginal note] grows warm.
Fifth Day. [At] our Monthly Meeting several strangers Thomas Lawrey
[note] Thomas Lawrey died in the fall 1815. A youngish man
and Joseph Justice appeared in prayer after noon for business I thought was pretty well and satisfactory. A concern which has been before our Yearly Meeting respecting establishing an institution for persons who have lost their reason was revived. Very lively spoken to and adjourned for further consideration. I believe it to be a right concern and that it will go forward. Thomas Lowrey and his companion Joseph Bassit (both of Salem County) came this evening to see us and a very agreeable visit it seemed to be to us all as they expressed. Some snow the first we have had so as to cover the ground clears up most severe freezing cold.
10. First Day. At Cropwell meeting things but low and poor this afternoon. At 3 o’clock Thomas Lowrey appointed a meeting at Cropwell. Thomas had considerable to say but not much animation although he spoke well and Joseph Justice was there. We dined at J. Lippincott.
14. At our meeting. Joseph Justice was there. Not the poorest time to me. This evening a very great snow fell.
15-16. Very cold.
17. First Day. Very cold. Confined at home.
21. More moderate. At our preparative meeting. Somewhat strengthening.
22. Went to the burial of Abraham Matlack, aged 83. They say a very hard working healthy strong man, an intimate acquaintance of mine in our young days. The people behaved very orderly.
[marginal note] Abraham Matlack’s daughter Deborah Hugg cried and grieved exceedingly at her father’s burial and was buried herself 16 or there about of the Third Month. It was thought took too much opium and slept to death.
24. First Day. At our meeting. Very small, seldom seen a lower tide.
[marginal note] A great snow, very cold.
28. Fifth. At our meeting though small and silent was to me satisfactory. Very cold weather. I am mostly confined to the house but mostly doing something.
31. First Day. Very cold, confined at home. Mercy Laning of Moorestown was buried after three or four days illness. The doctors call it the typhus fever which we hear is very mortal in some places. Stormy and snowy.
[marginal note] One of A. Matlack’s daughters very much took on and died herself soon. More moderate.
{1813-02}
4 of the Second Month. At our Monthly Meeting. Benjamin Swett and his wife there and had acceptable service and I thought it was a pretty good meeting.
[marginal note] Stormy snowy weather.
7. Was First Day. I wanted to go to Evesham but way did not open for it and I went to our meeting and an open favored, owning, strengthening, healing time it was to me and I believe to general satisfaction. We know not what is best for us or where it is best for us to be. But if we are but favored with best help all is right and well and without it we can do nothing. The breath of heaven must swell the sail or all the toil is lost <note resp="transcr">William Cowper, “Human Frailty.”</note>  .
<pb id="A0011526_010"/>
10 of the Second Month, 1813. Some observations on the happiness of an humble and serious life compared with that spent in vain passion pleasures and to eagerly pursuing the riches and honors of this world. 
[marginal note] great snow.
In order to check the inordinate desires after riches which some of the professors of Christianity formerly manifested and is equally applicable in this day, Saint Clemens, one of the primitive Christians who was wholly devoted to serve his Lord and master and an eminent instrument in the hand of God in gathering many into the fold of rest expresses himself on this wise: He that troubles not himself with anxious thoughts for more than is necessary lives little less than the life of angels whilst by a mind content with little he imitates their want of nothing. But those whose minds are taken up with an anxious thoughts for the things of this world only have been compared to Nebuchadnezzar at grass when a beast’s heart was given him. <note resp="transcr">Daniel 4</note>   See Ecclesiastes 3:18: I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts; see next verse 18.
Wycliffe thought all arts which administered to the luxuries of life were prohibited by the Gospel, and is it not so in these words be ye not conformed to this world <note resp="transcr">Romans 12:2</note>  ? Was this strictly observed? Oh, what stripping work it would make now in our day wherein there is so much conformity to the ways customs maxims and manners of this world. Further, Wycliffe says the Scripture tells us that having food and raiment we should therewith be content <note resp="transcr">Timothy 6:8</note>  . Reinhar though a Papish writer, gives a very favorable account of Wycliffe’s followers and disciples. He says they were men of a serious modest deportment avoiding all ostentation in dress, chaste and temperate, never seen in taverns or amused by the trifling gaieties of life – that they utterly despised wealth being fully content with bare necessaries: see [William] Gilpin's Life of Wycliffe. 
Hence it appears that these first reformers as well as the primitive Christians took our Savior's injunction in Matthew 6:19, Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth in a more literal sense than it has been understood by many high professors in more latter days. They were sensible of this declaration Mark 10:23, that it would be hard for those that had accumulated wealth or riches had added house to house and field to field <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 5:8</note>   to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The pious William Law on the spirit of prayer page 105 expresses himself thus; the heresy of all heresies is a worldly mind. See <italic>Book of Martyrs</italic>. How many righteous, faithful Protestants were burnt for heretics, and, oh, how doth a worldly spirit prevail although it is so much testified and cautioned against in Scripture? Be ye not conformed to this world <note resp="transcr">Romans 12:2</note>  . Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:19</note>  : Oh earth, earth. earth, hear Oh earth <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>  . Go to ye rich man weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon you <note resp="transcr">James 5:1</note>  . How hath it drowned many in destruction and perdition <note resp="transcr">Timothy 6:9</note>  . How stupefied and besotted many are as to religion become like the heath in the desert <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 17:6</note>   or deaf adder. <note resp="transcr">Psalms 58:4</note>  . And further says William Law we are apt to consider the temper as only an infirmity and pardonable failure but it is indeed the great apostasy from God and the Divine life. And Thomas à Kempis makes this just remark vanity most certainly it is with great solicitude to seek and place our hope and confidence in riches. Vanity – to cherish our ambition and strive by all possible means to attain a high and honorable station. Vanity most exquisite to be infinitely concerned for living long and perfectly indifferent or but coldly affected about living well.
<pb id="A0011526_011"/>
And such is the vanity of coveting great possessions that the learned, wise, and rich of this world, when alarmed with the solemn prospect of death and verging on the brink of an awful eternity, have to acknowledge unto the insufficiency thereof. Great numbers of instances of the truth of this might be collected; and some have even of the great and learned had to lament and confess and say, Ah! I have consumed a great part of my life in laborious doing nothing; and is it not to be feared that great numbers will see at last that they have consumed their time in things that do not profit, in laborious doing nothing: Straight is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life and few there be that find it <note resp="transcr">Matthew 7:14</note>  . Is it not strange to think and see how trifling, lukewarm and indifferent the generality of people spend their time and how inconsistent and contradictory it is to the profession and life of a Christian, which is a life of diligence, worthy moral precept.
See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Power of Religion On The Mind</italic>, page 32. Near his end said it is lamentable men consider not for what end they were born into the world till they were ready to go out of it. Words of Sir Thomas Smith.
1 Let thy thoughts be divine, awful, Godly.
2 Let thy talk be little, holy, true.
3 Let thy works be profitable, truly, charitable.
4 Let thy manners be sober, courteous, cheerful.
5 Let thy will be compliant, obedient, resigned.
6 Let thy reason be clear, evident, unbiased.
7 Let thy diet be temperate, convenient, frugal.
8 Let thy apparel be grave, plain, convenient.
9 Let thy sleep be moderate, quiet, seasonable.
10 Let thy retirement be serious, holy, pure.
11 Let thy prayers be devout, awful, fervent.
12 Let thy meditations be of death, judgment, eternity. <note resp="transcr">Clark, <italic>Religious Tracts</italic></note> 

Is it not to be feared that great numbers suffer irreparable loss for want of living agreeably to these precepts.
11 of Second Month, 1813, Fifth Day. There was a marriage at our meeting Isaac Horner of Springfield and Keziah Pharo. Hinchman Haines was there and I thought we were favored to come off pretty well and satisfactory at last.
14. First Day. I was at Evesham meeting. Hichman Haines took up all the time. He has just returned from a considerable journey in Pennsylvania: Stroudsburg, Muncy, and so, down through to Philadelphia. About home. Chiefly confined to the house. Cold weather.
18. Fifth Day. Our preparative meeting: not the poorest to me though silent at last pretty satisfactory. Heard of the death of Joseph Wilcox of Upper Evesham, upwards of eighty years, an innocent man and several others young people. One, tis said, a woman, died drunk. A.D. at Haddonfield and Rebeckah Coal, a young woman died of the consumption at Moorestown. Yet we hear of many deaths round about. A mortal fever prevails in divers places. Many accounts we hear of this mortal fever prevailing in New England, divers years past and of latter time in divers places round about us as Richard Jordan said when in his public testimony related how this fever raged in New England that it had seemed to him that other parts of our continent would be visited in like manner. William Branin of Evesham with his wife and son, a young man, were buried a few days ago with a mortal fever.
[marginal note] very cold.
21. First Day. A very cold storm of snowy time but moderates and I got to our meeting and came off middling well I hope though lowness and indolence too generally prevails – remark worthy of attention.
To think to spend his life in the advancement of science, the improvements of mankind, and the communication of happiness, whose time is employed in the unceasing use of his faculties and the energy of virtue, is the boast of the world, the delight of the Almighty, and the perfection of human nature.
Second Day. Very stormy. Snow, hail and rain and cold.
<pb id="A0011526_012"/>
A remark worthy of attention. Amidst all the vices and all the enormities of the Algerine Turks (a people distinguished for violence and rapacity and almost every species of cruelty) some good qualities are observable. The most abandoned wretch never presumes to utter the name of God in vain, or add it by way of decoration to his ribaldry. When will this be said even of men who boast and glory in their superior light and information?
26 Second Month, 1813. Weather more moderate. I got out to our select meeting at Moorestown and an owning, favored time it was notwithstanding the frailties and weaknesses that abound. Oh, how we are followed and spared when many are sorely afflicted with sore sickness and afflicted many ways and many deaths we almost daily hear of. Elizabeth Lippincott upwards of eighty years and several others much younger buried last Fifth Day. 
27. Grows very cold again and we hear of dreadful slaughters amongst the Indians and white people. Many hundreds it is said lately killed and many taken prisoners and of a very mortal sickness of which many died of late in the American camp in the wilderness country, Upper Canada or there away.
27. We have had a long spell of hard winter weather. Ground covered with snow many weeks but now winter seems to break up, and something like spring weather snow goes off.
28. First Day. I was at Cropwell Meeting and an open, owning, strengthening, healing time. It was to general satisfaction I believe. Friends after meeting were very pleasant kind and inviting unusually so. Oh, what a favor! Yet continued notwithstanding the much there is wanting on our part and the many frailties and weaknesses amongst us. We hear of much sickness round about and several sudden deaths about Haddonfield. Richard Matlack a youngish man, though married, and John Clements’s wife left a family of children and one very young. Buried today or yesterday.
See the 9 Chapter of Nehemiah, the latter part of it of God’s goodness and mercy in sparing and forgiving a backsliding rebellious people whom the Lord had done much for as is there set forth and much hath been done for us.
I think I see there is a growth in divers young ministers in divers places, notwithstanding the indifferency and lukewarmness that too generally prevails, and in divers places very amiable, clear, bright, able ministers of latter years are come forth.
Although we have had a long spell of cold freezing snowy weather first of the Third Month there was a heavy thundershower before the snow was quite gone. It is said the thunder struck down a chimney in Moorestown and stunned a child or girl, which recovered. This thunder coming so early and heavy seemed to be somewhat alarming to some with other thing: the wars and sickness round about in many places especially eastward in East Jersey. It is said eight graves were opened in one day in one yard and that two joiners one had made eighty and the other forty coffins and then died themselves.
{1813-03}
4 of the Third Month. At our Monthly Meeting which seemed to be lively and orderly conducted. Divers young striplings appeared very hopeful, but, as for me, I am like the grass or the flower that fadeth and withereth <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 40:7</note>  .
5 and 6. Freezing cold again.
6 of Month and Seventh [Day] of the week. I felt an engagement of mind to visit (or attend with the trustees) our very large school near us. There was a great number of spectators, many young men and young women very gay in their dress and appearance but behaved pretty orderly and well, and the school appeared to be preserved orderly though I thought there was much that opposed the right way of truth. Yet at last it manifestly raised into dominion over all and I had an owning satisfactory time. One said he was glad I was there.
<pb id="A0011526_013"/>
7th of the Third Month 1813. First Day. Exceeding cold and snows very fast. All complaining and none of us got to meeting. A severe, cold, freezing storm.
10. I got to our select meeting at Haddonfield. No strangers; all shut up in silence though there was a solemnity that was comfortable and something lively at last.
11. Was our quarterly meeting which was an highly favored, lively time. Samuel Leeds of Egg Harbor spoke first and did very well. Mentioned the sickness which prevailed there. Very mortal. Richard Jordan was raised in great eminence in the exercise of his most famous gift. He also mentioned the great sickness in New England where he had a few years ago lived, which took off many to the unknown regions of eternity, as he expressed it. He said it would come and break out in places, towns and villages, rage awhile and then go of without any remedies being found to stop it and that there was no fleeing from it, for it seemed to follow them from place to place where ever they went and said the physicians called it a malignant typhus fever and there are many round about us here who have been suddenly taken away with and divers now ill with it. Several very sudden deaths. We hear of one woman at Gloucester (Matlack) had five children was making up her bread and then went to take up her child to suckle it and fell on her face and died immediately. Oh what alarming calls frequently repeated and yet how trifling indifferency prevails respecting that of being in readiness at a short warning.
Third Month, 14, First Day. At our meeting came off middling well satisfied. Our son Joseph from Pennsylvania was here to see us with three of their children, fine and healthy. About home nothing material, unless it is the almost daily accounts of sickness and very sudden deaths. Three burials at Haddonfield in one day and accounts of the sickness prevailing and many deaths in places accounted formerly the most healthy in the Barrens.
[marginal note] Heard of eight burials at a time in one yard. Robert Rowand buried at Haddonfield a hard drinker.
Fifth Day. At our meeting Levi Lippincott and Hannah Roberts were married. It was a low dull time forepart but growed better and ended pretty well. J. Matlack and Ann Edwards both appeared just at last. Heard of several sudden deaths. One woman, Abraham Matlack’s daughter, and he buried a few weeks ago, it was thought [she] took too much anodyne and slept to death. Left a family. Three shot near one time by design in malice and great anger, two in Pennsylvania and one in Jersey.
21. First Day. At our meeting Ann Edwards appeared lively and acceptable. I shut up about home. Very cold again and snow, etc.
25. Third Month, Fifth Day. At our meeting Joseph Buzby and Margaret Haines were married. I thought it was an open, owning, strengthening, healing time to me once more. Now in advanced age near 73 and under much weakness of body and mind. We still continue to hear of the sickness in divers places. Three died suddenly in one house.
Seventh Day I heard of two families up in the Barrens near Edgepelick where the Indians some years ago lived. 
[marginal note] McBride and King, the men’s names. 
The fathers and mothers both died with this prevailing disorder called the typhus or nervous fever and left nineteen children in the two families. Our neighbors were going to take the poor children. The women were sisters. One of the men had made great improvements. We hear of the sickness prevailing much in divers places on every side.
28. Was First Day very stormy, but I did get to our meeting. Margaret Allinson and Elizabeth Coleman from Burlington were there and had very acceptable service much against the love of the world. They are young ministers, weakly and tender in body but bold and strong in spirit. Margaret is one of our girls lately raised up, and if the people did but rightly consider it, and see it, they must needs say with the Egyptians of old: the finger of God is in it <note resp="transcr">Exodus 8:19</note>  . A blessing and favor and mercy that such is raised up, a succession of living ministers like lilies of the valley, growing and flourishing in the truth whilst those of human invention are consuming away like a moth <note resp="transcr">Psalm 39:11</note>  . As Jerome the Martyr prophesied would be the case several hundred years ago, a new people shall be raised up who shall renounce the glory of this world and seek after the cultivation of the inward man. They shall have ministers raised up amongst themselves and elders and other officers in the Church; they shall grow and flourish in the truth whilst those of human invention shall consume away like a moth. We hear of great troubles of wars round about so it is sword and pestilence <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 24:10?</note>  .

{1813-04}
Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though small, was satisfactory and strengthening to me.
4 of the Fourth Month 1813. First Day. A shut up time to me. I was unwell hardly able to sit meeting. 
About home till Fifth Day the 8. At our Monthly Meeting Joseph Matlack appeared and Ann Edwards very lively and growing, a favored meeting to me at last satisfactory.
[marginal note] very warm.
Sixth Day, 9 of the Month. I went to Evesham Monthly Meeting. Waters seemed low and at last there appeared a great cause why it was so. For it appeared there was great contentions amongst them, confusion and great weakness, come off middling.
11. First Day. At our meeting no satisfaction. A humbling mortifying time to me and perhaps profitable although I did not feel like running through a troop after meeting <note resp="transcr">Psalm 18:29</note>  . 
Reading accounts of Friends deceased <note resp="transcr">London Yearly Meeting, 1760.</note>  . See page 330. David Hall’s words of council the youth not to content themselves with formality which is in religious matters to no more than a dark dry and empty lamp. Those more advanced in years he called out of worldly mindedness and indifferency, lukewarmness and indolence, often reminding us of the church of Laodicea that her case was as vile in the sight of God as that of the wicked and profane. See two leaves back, 10 of Second Month, William Law’s words: The heresy of all heresies is a worldly mind etc.
Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and silent though not the poorest to me. Some strengthening.
6. I went to mend Joseph Roger’s pump and was at Cropwell Meeting. Though very small was open and satisfactory, owning, healing and strengthening to me.
18. At our meeting. First Day. Though as to me silent yet not the poorest. A. Edwards about home often. Very poorly not able to tend Yearly Meeting. Many bodily infirmities.
22. Our preparative meeting in a good degree satisfactory to me.
25 First Day. Elizabeth Kerling was at our meeting and had close work with the careless, lukewarm and indifferent. About home. Very poorly with the asthma and colic.
Fifth Day. At our meeting which was open, owning and to my good satisfaction.
{1813-05}
6. Caleb McCumber of the Genesee country appointed a meeting at Moorestown 4th hour and had a great deal to say but I thought there was but little animation. Many dull and heavy and some very sleepy sleepy even whilst he was preaching. Plenty makes dainty: and as we read except the dead be raised preaching is in vain <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:14</note>   and as said the prophet in the name of the Lord since the days that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day have I sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them yet have ye not turned unto me <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 7:25-26</note>  : this may be said of many though not quite all, and it is said Noah was a preacher of righteousness many years before the flood <note resp="transcr">2 Peter 2:5</note>  , yet they went on in iniquity until the flood came and swept them all away except Noah and his family. This Caleb McCumber was here about a year ago and has been through the southern provinces since he was here. An able minister.
Fifth Month, 22. Was First Day. Though poorly I was at our meeting which was silent though not the poorest to me. No commission or ability to say anything. We read that Christ did not many great and mighty works where the people’s hearts were not prepared to receive and that the word preached did not profit because it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 4:2</note>  . So when strangers come and appoint meeting the people’s minds are so much outward and unprepared that there seems often now a days but little animation. Though powerful preachers, yet dull hearers; it’s like music to a sleepy man. Heard of the death of a young woman at Moorestown of this disorder going about a very few days illness and Mary Elphrey of Haddonfield, a Friend in that ministry.
<pb id="A0011526_015"/>
4th of the Fifth Month, 1813. Stormy. See James Naylor, page 177. Only to those who have no other lovers in the world the Lord gives himself.
See [Robert] Barclay’s <italic>Apology</italic>, page 457: For in as much as our communion with Christ is and ought to be our greatest and chiefest work we ought to do all other things with a respect to God and our fellowship with him etc. page 461, of which communion (with Christ) they would rob themselves if they did evil. If so, then what multitudes have and are daily robbing themselves of the very greatest of blessings that ever was bestowed on mankind. For as one justly observed of all the blessing of the great creator (Himself) is the crown of all. So then see John Woolman's <italic>Journal,</italic> page 27, the expressions of his sister: O Lord that I may enjoy thy presence or else my time is lost and my life a snare to my soul  and as our Friends said they had rather be in prison enjoying the Lord’s favor than out of prison and out of his favor for the Lord’s presence and favor could make a prison as pleasant as a palace and bread and water as satisfactory as the most delicious dainties. Nothing very material to remark of late. At our Monthly Meeting last week Joseph Matlack appeared lively and growing. I was poorly. Pain in my head got wet and took some cold. See memorial of John Hallowell of Philadelphia, page 382.
[marginal note] See <italic>Memorials</italic>, page 382, John Hallowell’s last words to his children to be blest with the presence of the Lord in a dungeon is preferable to liberty enjoyed in a palace without it. Of Philadelphia.
9. Was First Day. At our meeting. A very great number of people. Susanna Horn from England sent word that she intended to be there but was disappointed of being there by reason of the very sudden death of Caleb Shreve, who has traveled very much with her as a companion and was just about to take leave of his family to go with her again to New York Yearly Meeting. In a solemn pause with his family he was suddenly struck with death; and we hear of divers being taken off with the prevailing disorder with very short illness. Phineas Lord of Woodbury, an elder was one; he was here to see me in my sickness about two years ago with Joseph Whiteall and John Wilkins of Upper Evesham as it is said went to see his son-in-law's family Hugh Sharp, who lately died with the disorder J. Wilkins took sick there and there died below Haddonfield. We have had a long spell of wet cloudy stormy weather, which much affects my asthmatic cough, but yet have got out to meeting – though often so poorly I can hardly keep up.
[marginal note] begun to plant.
10. Second Day. Ruth Hallock from State of New York had an appointed meeting at Moorestown and had very acceptable service.
3 and 4th. Planting corn, etc.
13. Fifth [Day] of the week. At our meeting. Though small it was an open, owning, healing, strengthening time to me. If we are but favored whom or what have we to fear?
Sixth Day, 14. Rainy. See Stephen Crisp’s <italic>Sermons</italic>, page 89: If I do but answer mine own conscience, I fear no man. Page 90: This makes a man as bold as a lion. Again same page: If mine own heart doth not condemn one all the world cannot condemn me. And may I not add: if all the world justify me and yet mine own heart condemn me I must stand condemned. As say the Scriptures if thy heart condemn the God is greater and knoweth all things <note resp="transcr">1 John: 3:20</note>  . Or to this effect: so great a thing is the reproofs of instruction, the way of life, that by which we stand justified or condemned, the way of life, the word by which man lives and not by bread alone <note resp="transcr">Luke 4:4</note>   as we read in Scripture. Oh how little it is considered to be so great a thing by thousands!
15. Heard of the death of Job Cowperthwaite and of George Graham. Both died very suddenly. Both of Moorestown, hard drinkers.
<pb id="A0011526_016"/>
15. Fifth Month, 1813. Although I was very poorly with the asthma and colic I went to the burial of Job Cowperthwaite, who died very suddenly. A very hard drinker, a worthless, base man many ways. I have dealt very closely and plainly with him, and he has always seemed to respect me and has been very kind to me. The people behaved orderly, still and quiet, but there seemed no more concern than if it had been the burial of a horse. There seemed no openness for to say any thing scarcely, yet I had some little remarks and felt no condemnation nor much satisfaction. He has left six sons and six daughters and they have buried several very young. George Graham went to Trenton on business, was throwed out of his carriage and found dead. He also was said to be a drunken man, but these solemn awful calls seem to have little or no effect on the drunkards. They buried him there and then dug him up and brought him home.
15. First Day. At our meeting. Ann Edwards had very acceptable service. After meeting my wife and I went home with Job Cowperthwaites widow and children and divers of their relations. We had a good savory and I hope solid satisfactory time there.
17. Second Day but poorly wet weather affects my complaints. See Stephen Crisp’s <italic>Sermons, </italic>page 231, the word of God a Christian’s Life: I exhort you all in the love of God that you would prize this manner of speaking and look upon it as the greatest mercy that ever you enjoyed – prize it above all your mercies. Health and wealth and all other mercies are not worthy to be compared to this voice of God speaking in you. They that prize it will never complain for want of power; they will find power in it. All the power in Heaven and earth is contained in this truth that shines unto you etc. Page 232: amongst all the blessing with which we are favored yet this is a blessing which can only make the soul happy, that an intercourse between it and its maker is open: and can we not easily see the state of poor man without it? Do we not fall below the brutal part of the creation? This is evident in thousands of instances without it. I heard one say they never heard of such numbers of sudden deaths as now of late, both in town and country. In town a widow Rogers died instantly at breakfast. Samuel Webster, an elder of Haddonfield, went to Salem, was taken with this prevailing disorder and brought home a corpse (we hear). Both far advanced in year between seventy and eighty. 
19. I went up in the pine after pine knots; called to see my dear old friend Joshua Lippincott who is yet very poorly, confined to his bed. There were several neighbors, relations and we had a satisfactory little sitting together, however I believe it was so to all of us. This was the last time I seen him. See Thomas à Kempis, page 147, on resignation, etc. It is hard to judge rightly whether a good spirit or the contrary incline thee to desire this or that or whether thou art not moved by thine own spirit. Many are deceived in the end who at the first seemed to be led by a good spirit. 
[marginal note] Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, says the scripture <note resp="transcr">Matthew 4:4</note>  .
Page 152: For he standeth very totteringly that casteth not his whole care upon thee: a great thing to keep a single eye to him who said Look unto me all ye ends of the earth and be ye saved no other name given.
[marginal note] planting time very busy.
20. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though very small, was strengthening and satisfactory.
24. First Day. At our meeting and I believe there appeared a living concern in divers, Ann Edwards, John Collins and several others – J. Roberts and A.H. - and that there was something owning, strengthening and gathering and satisfactory to me, and I thought the meeting seemed to end solid, savory, lively, and well.
<pb id="A0011526_017"/>
25. Fifth Month, 1813. We still continue to hear the language of mortality frequently and divers remark an uncommon number of very sudden deaths. James Whiteal, said to be a very hard drinking man, a few weeks ago died very suddenly about Woodbury.
27. At our preparative meeting. It seemed open and some life, but yet I had no satisfaction.
[marginal note] rain rain rain.
29. On Seventh Day Elias Hicks of New York appointed a meeting at Moorestown and had a great deal to say. He is a very great minister, one of the first class. His testimony seemed principally or very much on the subject of war.
30. Fifth Month, First Day morning, Whilst man in this imperfect state, of being is confined, what pains assail the outward frame, what sorrow vex his mind.
At our meeting our little girl Ann Edwards did famously and worthily and the meeting though low at first ended savory and solidly. See Thomas à Kempis, page 92: For spiritual comforts exceed all the delights of the world and pleasures of the flesh. God doth well in giving the grace of consolation, but man doth evil in not returning all again unto God with thanksgiving. And therefore the gifts of grace cannot flow into us because we are not thankful to the giver and return them not wholly to the fountain. As [Isaac] Watts says how prone we are to make idols of the blessings bestowed on us, etc.
[marginal note] Second Day. Very fine growing weather.
Last Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though small, was open and lively with some and satisfactory, although some very drowsy.
{1813-06}
6 of Sixth Month, First Day. I went to Evesham Meeting, and I don’t know but it was as open and satisfactory a time, as I almost ever had there. My wife has been very poorly and at times very ill with the chill and fever about a week past.
10 of Fifth Month. Was our Monthly Meeting. John Baldin from Pennsylvania and Nathan Smith of Philadelphia were there. First sitting was silent but on the whole it was a good, satisfactory, pleasant time.
Sixth Day I was at Evesham Monthly Meeting. John Baldin and N. Smith had lively, savory service, although forepart was very low and dull, some very trying troublesome cases. Yet friends seemed favored with patience to wade through, and I thought a degree of life and savor at last.
[marginal note] rainy
13. First Day. See Thomas à Kempis page 118: How can I bear myself unless thou strengthen with thy mercy and grace. Turn not thy face from one. Delay not thy visitation; take not away thy comfort lest my soul become as the thirsty land. And see page 69: Nothing so defileth and entangleth the heart of man as the impure love of creatures. At our meeting I was unwell with a pain in my head, could hardly sit this afternoon. At 4 o’clock John Baldin had a meeting at Cropwell. N. Smith, Nathan Yarnal and divers others were there. But we had but little preaching. John Balding appeared in prayer at last and N. Yarnal and Hichman Haines had something to say and I hope the meeting ended pretty well at last.
We hear of an alarming accident a few days ago. Lawyer Morgan of Philadelphia was going up the river to his farm and had his boat loaded too heavy, tis said, with marble. Had his house keeper, Lidia Johnson, an aged woman, and a young woman, a Philadelphia man and a Negro man. A gale of wind came up and the boat, being too heavy loaded, filled and sunk. The two women and Negro man were drowned. Morgan and the other buoyed themselves up with the oars till assistance came to them. See the uncertainty of time and the truth of Seneca’s remarks: when we go out we don’t know we shall return, etc. I hear of dismal scenes of sorrow all round us. Ann Matlack, wife of Joseph Lays, ill with a dismal cancer which they say smells very nauseous or very bad, and John Brick lost his reason, which some say is the greatest calamity of human beings. Three men died very sudden at Egg Harbor. One a recruiting officer, found dead in his bed, and I am told there has of late been many sudden death thereaway.
[marginal note] Dull hay weather.
16. I went to our select meeting at Evesham. Nathan Smith and Richard Jordan had lively excellent service. Richard exceeded all, it was most excellent.
17. Quarterly meeting. N. Smith and Elizabeth Kerling had very lively, pertinent service. Last evening we had a very heavy thundershower and very hard wind. Blowed down many apple trees and very much hence, so it is call after call divers ways and manners.
<pb id="A0011526_018"/>
Last week we were busily engaged cutting and getting in our clover hay and were favored to get most of it in without much damage, I reckon about 4 or 5 ton. We have had very wet, showery weather and it yet continues.
[marginal note] 1813.
20. First Day. A very rainy morning. I have worked and wearied myself more than I was able. See 1 Kings 19:11 verse: and a strong wind rent the mountain. Psalms 7:2: lest he tear my soul and rent it in pieces. Psalms 50:22: consider this lest I tear you in pieces. Two evenings last week there was very hard winds, heavy thundershowers which tore down many of our fruit trees and beat down the rye some. At Mount Holly I am told there was hailstones as big as the end of a man’s thumb but did not do much damage. Went to our meeting and I thought somewhat favored, but I was wearied over much and on the whole had no satisfaction. But otherwise not able to travel I hear that the hard winds has blowed down the rye so that some say in places they will never be able to gather one half of it, and abundance of timber blowed down. See <italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic>, page 130, George Fox and others visit to that nation: oh the brokenness that was among them in the flowings of life! So that in the power and Spirit of the Lord, many together broke out into singing with audible voice. Then an account follows of a dreadful war broke out and a time of dreadful suffering and great distress and destruction, yet Friends were generally preserved through all, and see page 165: and besides all this at the return of the armies to winter quarters the country was filled with violent sickness, which took away many of all sorts. Some seemed to grieve at their losses and low estate and so languished and died, which friends were greatly supported over having an eye to the Lord who not only gives but takes or suffers to be taken away. Then see page 177: Now after the troubles and scarcity above mentioned there suddenly succeeded a time of great plenty after a wonderful manner beyond what could be expected, and the time of getting great riches came on as the time of great losses had been experienced before, and many too eagerly pursued them, which proved very injurious to them and their children. Beware, said the prophet, least your hearts deceive you and you and ye be drawn aside after other gods <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 11:16</note>  . See it is said some stood firm in all the troubles and trials and fell in this time of prosperity. Their persecutors could not frighten them from keeping up their meetings with all their swords and guns and bitter abuses, yet see what follows. See page 284: It is observable that in this time of outward peace and freedom from sufferings of divers kinds to which friends had been exposed, cause was given for complaints to their superior meetings 1720 of the breach of minutes through the prevalence of a loose libertine spirit among many of our youth and a careless, sleepy, slothful spirit with respect to religious duties among some more aged. And see page 404: not all the persecutions, said a certain eminent elder, not all the apostates nor all the open or private enemies we have ever had have done us as a Christian society the damage that riches have done. Then follow an account how grievously these times of prosperity spoiled their youth, etc., and many grievous evils it introduced, the way opening to get riches, etc.
[marginal note] showery very wet weather.
[marginal note] They worshiped the works of their own hand, that which their own fingers had made <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:8</note>  .
Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and low and poor, yet I believe there was an earnest concern, and some stirrings of life appeared at last amongst a remnant, on account of the dullness and many deficiencies, after so much labor bestowed on us as we have had of late. Remember the ground that being after water and brings forth briars, etc.
<italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic> and see the conclusion, page 470: behold a people raised up under very great sufferings through persecution, wars, scarcity sometimes of bread and thriving under opposition and great oppression and what great numbers of powerful ministers, men and women and some even boys and girls were raised up in their youthful days who were made instrumental to batten down the strongholds of sin and Satan. Behold also a pattern of the restoration of Christian discipline to its primitive simplicity and purity. And after all, at last the pernicious effects of ease and affluence with respect to the prosperity of the church may be here clearly perceived – and that at length to be brought about in the days of outward liberty and ease, which all the storms of persecution were not able to effect, as in the forgoing part of the history appears, viz. coolness of love to God and one another. And too too many of the descendants of those men, who maintained their integrity unviolated in times of suffering, now loosing the primitive simplicity and moderation and in imminent danger of being incorporated again with the world and its corruptions, as by the latter part of this history appears. 
<pb id="A0011526_019"/>
1813 First Day, 27 Sixth Month. See page 9, <italic>Rise and Progress</italic>: the true origin of this woeful apostasy seems to have been pretty deeply seated viz. in the corruption of human nature. We are told that pride found admittance even among the angels and degraded them from their heavenly stations. It also, through the inspiration of the serpent, found entrance into paradise and appears to have been one principal cause of the fall of our first parent, see Genesis 3: 5-6, etc.
And again upon the same principle, what else but pride was the origin of those great contentions we read of that the Christians of the fourth century fell into about their creeds, etc.? 10 page: Outward ease, liberty, and an affluence of the riches of this world. When the churches fortune grew better, her sons grew worse and some of her fathers worst of all. The corruption of Christians dated from the time they became rich, endowed with lands, pensions and patrimonies etc. Their bishops, feeling the smack of wealth, ease and prosperity, began to swell in pride and pomp, etc. Where I also read that about this time, a voice was heard, as it were, from heaven over the city of Constantinople, saying this day is poison poured forth into the churches. So a dismal account follows of grievous suffering to the faithful by persecution, wars and scarcity of bread and grievous sickness were the people afflicted with.
Samuel Fothergill in one [of] his sermons says pride has been the downfall of the greatest empires and flourishing countries that ever was in the world. I have read the <italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic> through in less than a week, near 500 pages. A great favorite of mine, have not seen it several years. I take it up when I am weary and cannot work any longer, which often happens now a days. Humility the spring of virtue is, humble thyself and virtue thou cannot miss, but otherwise sure to miss of it, so no other way of safety but to keep humble.
This 27 Sixth Month, First Day. At our meeting. Although I was very poorly, it was an open, owning, healing, strengthening time to me. Evidently helped: now watch
First Day afternoon. See <italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic>, page 174: John Burnyeat's prophetic warning, viz. It is now a time of great trial upon you in loosing what you have. But the time will come when you will be as greatly tried with getting wealth, which was soon after accomplished. It somewhere said in that book [added later: I found now page 476], the words of an eminent minister: that corruption never did overspread the church but when or unless the ministers and elders gave way. These are looked upon as the principal pillars.
29. I went to the burial of Anna Matlack, wife of Joseph, who died with a cancer or something like it. Nathan Smith and Joseph Justice were there. A meeting was held after burial and I hope for the better. N. S. and I had something to say at the house and at the meeting and all seemed to end well and to satisfaction.
[marginal note] 1815 Nathan Smith fell into great trouble on account of his children’s bad conduct, see the slippery state.
30. Getting hay. Catching cloudy, rainy weather – see Samuel Fothergill's <italic>Sermons</italic> page 58: and indeed without this blessed hope we are of all creatures the most miserable! Being daily surrounded with lamentation and woe! Combating with secret or obvious distress from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual succession and variety of afflictions! We might therefore truly say if our hopes were only fixed upon the transitory and fleeting pleasures of this life, we should be of all the animal creation the most miserable. But we are assured that nothing less than God himself is the infinite and endless reward of all that diligently and constantly solicit him to the following purpose. Two things have I required of thee. Deny me them not before I die, etc. Agurs prayer: Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient for me, etc. See 1 Corinthians 15:19, If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable.
[marginal note] Very cloudy dull weather. A busy time about hay. A fine season for grass.
{1813-07}
Fifth Day. At our meeting, which was very small and to me very poor and low. I feel the effects of old age and am forced to weary myself too much. Help very scarce and dear. I had, as I often have, a kind of numbness and pain in my head, which disables me from a travel or silent labor, meditation or contemplation. Joseph Justice was there and he and J.C. said a little at last respecting something good hovering over us but I believe it was but little of that and hid from me.
6 and 7th Day. Getting some hay, etc.
<pb id="A0011526_020"/>
1813 on Seventh Day. At 3 o’clock, 3 of the Sixth Month, went to the burial of my kind, dear old Friend Joshua Lippincott, upwards of eighty years of age. And although I had no satisfaction, I felt no condemnation or a wish to recall what I had to say amongst the people. Yet something was wanting in me or them or both. Between me and him there has been an uninterrupted unity between thirty and forty years. He was an elder of good and sound judgment although of but few words; he was like a father to me, and we were always suited together with one another’s company. I was with him in a spell of illness above thirty years ago when he expressed a willingness to die. I told him it was a fine thing to be willing to die. He said yes and to know for what, too, and he has in several spells of sickness since expressed the same resignation, so he is now gone and gathered like a shock of corn in its season, I have no doubt, gathered into the corner of rest and peace. Now just in the midst of harvest.
4. First Day. I had thoughts of going to Evesham but way did not open for it. So I went to our meeting, concluding to quite lay by or shut up. But soon after I sat down, found I was favored, and a satisfactory, open, owning, strengthening time it was. Oh, how little do we know where it is best for us to be! Surely mercy and goodness follows us about hay, etc. Nothing very material to remark except as I remark a few weeks ago we frequently hear of scenes of sorrow and that John Brick had lost his reason, and now we hear he is dead, cut his own throat. See John Everard’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 75: if thou hast set thy seal to the creatures and that they have stolen away thy heart and thou art in love with them, knit to them and art made one with them, then when thou comest die thou hast no refuge to trust to; they will all fail thee, etc. An excellent sentence and see page 132, respecting a right use of the creatures and not abusing them or our selves with them in pride and wantonness, etc. Page 158 he says, I remember also, a speech of Bernard’s that mind is far from God or heaven which in prayers (or desires) is full of earthly requests. But, oh, is not the universal language give, give? Give us prosperous, plentiful seasons so that our barns etc. may be well filled. Then what next? Eat, drink and take thy rest. Like him we read of whose ground brought forth plentifully etc., but what follows, thou fool? This night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:16-20</note>  ? So it shall be with all those that lay up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God.
This is harvest time, and, on the whole, some say a rich plentiful harvest, although in places much beat down with the hard winds and, tis said, hurt in places with the hail, which it is said that the hail stones was as big as a man’s watch a few miles eastward of us.
8 of the month. Was our Monthly Meeting and I thought whilst we were reading the extracts from our Yearly Meeting and Epistle there was something pretty savory and lively, but we humd [hummed?] over them till we lost it all as I thought, and I had no satisfaction but rather a mortifying time and may be that is best for me.
12. First Day. At our meeting, and silent and as destitute of life almost as I have seen. People have worked hard getting harvest and hay, so dullness and heaviness follows, not keeping the eye of the mind enough on the better thing, like Mary of old which it is said should not be taken from her <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:42</note>  . Gilbert Deacon, a stout young man, died with a very short illness.
13. We have had a very fine, wet season till now. Latter end of harvest the corn and grass begin to suffer for want of rain. Harvest mostly housed, and although the winter hurt the grain in low places, and the storm and hard winds beat it down in places, and in some places the hail hurt it, yet for all it is said to be a rich, plentiful harvest, the grain plump and full and good. Some years ago the grain was shrunk and little and black. It seemed as if there was but very little meal in it. What lessons of instruction: by these things we may see how easy a great deal may soon be blasted and a little blessed.
[marginal note] Rain and thunder this morning.
14. Seventh Month. We went to see our brother-in-law Enoch Evans, who has had several shocks of the palsy and now lays very ill. Has a very bad sore, a boil or carbuncle, on his back, but he now seems resigned and quiet – an unspeakable favor, which the whole world cannot give.
<pb id="A0011526_021"/>
15. Seventh Month, Fifth Day. At our meeting, very small, Joseph Matlack and Ann Edwards had considerable to say – growing and improving young ministers.
16. I went to Joseph Rogers to mend his pump and was at Cropwell meeting to pretty good satisfaction, though it was very small. The world outbids all.
17. Getting hay and oats, etc. I am forced to work, though often very poorly.
18. First Day. At our meeting and a satisfactory, open, healing, strengthening time it was to me. I could not see that anyone was burdened, but it ended well. Very different from last First Day, when all was shut up, naked, poor and empty. Ambrose Chapman, an intelligent young man who has kept school amongst us, lately returned from a tour in the western territories, state of Ohio, etc. Informs me that it is very trying times with friends there; they being drafted and fined and distressed with the military men of martial spirits and that they are very bitter and malicious against Friends for refusing to assist in the wars and many families women and children in great fears of the Indians and sometimes frightened and alarmed with false alarms in the night, so that many are very much afraid to stay at their home and want to move. Yet he says their country as to improvements is vastly improved and prosperous; their land being very fertile, they abound in vast, great plenty. It seems incredible to tell what vast improvements have been made. In about twenty year ago, I was first there. They had no Monthly Meeting over the mountains; their young people were then forced to come over to Fairfax Monthly Meeting to pass meeting, and now in that space of time they, I think they say, have five quarterly meetings, and now this fall they are to have a yearly meeting to be held at Short Creek. Seldom if ever was there ever know a more rapid settlement. Far and wide for many hundreds of miles and a vast number of Friends there settled and many great towns and vast numbers of villages, where but a few years ago was inhabited by the Indians or an entire vast, howling wilderness inhabited only by wolves, bears and beast and birds of the wilderness.
[marginal note] I hear of the death of my cousin John Hunt of Ohio, who was drafted or diged [digged] out amongst the soldiers last fall. Hardships and suffering brought on a consumptive complaint, and he died a few weeks ago. A youth of a very sweet, kind disposition.
22. Fifth Day. Our preparative meeting. A very busy time about hay and weather very showery. The meeting very small but yet some life. Ann Edwards was favored. We were favored to get in four loads of hay, with hard scuffling, but it almost over did me, wearying with one thing or another.
25. First Day. At our meeting and I think it was an open, owning, favored time, even to the reviving of a hope of the right kind uniting and strengthening. This afternoon I went to the burial of an aged Negro man eighty or upward called Sigibul [indecipherable].
[marginal note] very much rain.
27. Heard of the death of Thomas Evans, the elder son of Jacob, and no doubt all is well with him, if accumulating wealth and laying up treasure on earth was all that was required of us, for in that few if any have exceed him. About getting in hay, very busy. 
29. Fifth Day. At our meeting small and poor.
29. William Williamson  and his son’s companion (a beautiful youth) had a meeting at Moorestown begun at 10 and broke up at one. Abundance of preaching; we had a large door of utterance but a want of a door of entrance, and animation much wanting as it seemed to me. 
[marginal note] from the Tennessee country, eight hundred miles from here, his son told me.
[30] Seventh Day. Getting some hay and I put a new box in Joseph Evans his pump.
{1813-08}
1. of the Eighth Month First Day. At our meeting a good meeting open and owning and strengthening. Very busy going getting in our hay and favored to get along beyond expectation.
Fifth Day Monthly Meeting and I thought lively but not keeping enough in the humility and watchfulness. It was a mortifying time to me. Ann Edwards laid a concern before friends to visit some meetings in Maryland, Virginia, and Ohio, which was united with Joseph Matlack favored. Finished getting in our hay. Very dry weather here with us, though there was a soaking shower a few days ago a few miles eastward.
Seventh Day I took up a pump for the widow Matlack at Penney Town, and was helping my son Benne get in oats.
[marginal note] pinched with dry weather here, though soaking showers round about.

8th of the Eighth Month 1813. First Day. See <italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic>, the state of Friends in 1656 as described by William Edmundson, page 111: In those days the world and the things of it were not near our hearts, but the love of God, his truth and testimony lived in our hearts. We were glad of one another’s company, though sometimes our outwards fare was very mean and our lodging on straw. We did not mind high things, but were glad of one another’s welfare in the Lord, and his love dwelt in us <note resp="transcr">Thomas Wight and John Rutty, <italic>A History of the rise and progress of the people called Quakers in Ireland, from the year 1653 to 1700</italic>. Dublin, Printed by I. Jackson, 1751.</note>  . Now how is it with us in our days? Can we say we do not mind high things when we now abound in such costly, painted, curious jumping chariots or carriages? Our lodging not on straw but on most curious, costly beds of feathers and ceiled rooms, etc., etc. Can we say the love of God dwells in our hearts, or are we advancing towards the state of the people the prophet mentions when he said their land is full of silver and gold and there is no end of their treasures? Their land also is full of horses; there is no end of their chariots; their land is full of idols; they worship the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:7</note>  . The foxes have holes and the fowls of the air have nests, but the son of Man hath not where on to lay his hand <note resp="transcr">Matthew 8:20</note>  .
[marginal note] see Isaiah 2 chapter 7 and 8 verse.
Was at our meeting which was not the lowest and poorest to me, though silent. As to me, see <italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic>, page 77, the words of John Webster preached in 1654, viz: It is not holding forth the highest profession of Christ in the letter that makes us free, except Christ come into the heart and make us free, indeed. The chief thing every soul is to mind, in reading and hearing, is to examine whether the same thing be wrought in them – whatever we find in the letter, if it be not made good in us, what are the words to us? We must see how Christ is crucified and buried in us and how he is risen and raised from death in us. The chief thing, I say, is to look into our own breasts. All generally that hold forth a profession of Christ, they say in words that Christ is the Deliverer. But that is not the thing – is he a Deliverer to thee? Is that glorious Messiah promised and the Deliverer with power come into thy soul? Hath he exalted himself there? Hath he made bare his arm and been a glorious conqueror in thee? Hath he taken to himself his great power to reign in thee? Is he, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, in thee? What ever thou talkest of Christ and his miracles, if thou hast no witness, no evidence, of the truth of them in thy own heart, what is all that ever he did, and what is all that ever he suffered to thee? It may be thou hast or mayst have a notion and opinion of the things of God and thou hast them by history and by relation or education or example or customs or by tradition or because most men have received them for truths. But if thou hast not evidence of his mighty miracles and god like power in thy own soul, how canst thou be a witness that they are the things that thou hast seen and heard? For all those outward things are but shadows and representations, figures and patterns of the Heavenly things themselves. Thou mayst have a strong opinion but no experience of them, viz. that Christ hath freed and delivered thy soul. Hast thou really seen thyself in captivity deaf, dumb, blind, and lame? Oh, that men were but come to this condition, to be sensible of their misery! Oh then what mourning, what hanging of their harps upon the willows and sitting by the rivers of Babylon and crying out, How shall we sing the Lords song in a strange land? Till they have deliverance they cannot but mourn and who can deliver them but the Lion of the Tribe of Judah? To such a soul only Christ is precious. Others may talk of him and make a great profession of him, but they cannot Love him til he be Immanuel and Saviour in them. Forms and ordinances cannot be the rest of a Christian, because they may be used and lived in and admired and prized whilst those that use them may be carried away with divers lusts. Thus, may not one be dipped. and receive water baptism and yet be a sorcerer? Was not Simon Magus so? May not one be at breaking of bread with Christ and yet be a devil? Yes, for so was Judas, so for Webster.
[marginal note] Several showers.
Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and silent. Some gone to court, some to Woodbury Quarter.
15. Eighth Month, First Day. At our meeting came off pretty well, I hope.
Fifth Day. At our meeting (very small). A stranger, tis said a Baptist minister, was there, and I think it was to me a satisfactory, strengthening time.
<pb id="A0011526_023"/>
22 of the Eighth Month, 1813. Was First Day. Went with our ancient sister Hannah Buzby, who has been with us several days, to Evesham meeting, which was open and satisfactory. Spent the afternoon at our son John’s.
[23-24.] Second and Third Days. Visited our friend Rebeckah Roberts. In the 94th year of her age, she retains her memory and faculties so as to converse on religious subjects, lively and pleasant and full of love to all. And went to see Mary Cowperthwaite, in a deep consumption, and to see Phebe Roberts, greatly afflicted and crippled with the rheumatism:
[25.] 4[th day.] Thomas Homes sent for me to come to see him and I went. He has been several years in a poor, low, disconsolate state of mind, though it seems much turned on religion and the company of friends. He told me he sent for me to have a sitting in silence, and I thought we had a pretty sweet time with them, he having a choice religious woman to his wife. I then went to see my old kind friends, Joshua Lippincott’s children, and that it seemed all right and seasonable. I then went to William Rogers to put new boxes in his pump. There I had a disagreeable talk but came off clear, then stopped at my son John’s, got some smith work done, and then went to see an ancient black woman under great affliction, all to satisfaction.
26. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. A very low, poor time, forepart dull and drowsy, not reputable, though Ann Edwards helped to raise it a little answering queries. I had satisfaction something lively, uniting, and strengthening though a very low time.
29. First Day. A very stormy day, a great rain. meeting very small though not so poor and low, as some pretty open. Ann Edwards and myself had considerable to say and I thought my mind was helped and replenished. Yet at last not that satisfactory as at some times. See 2 of Samuel 19 and 11 verse: why are ye the last to bring the king back? This seemed to illustrate in my view and an instructing lesson. Verse the 9: they were remind what the king had done for them, how he had saved them out of the hand of their enemies and delivered them out of the hand of the Philistines, etc. Now the King of Kings seeks a place and dwelling amongst us, stands knocking at the door of our hearts and hath promised to be with the two or three gathered in his name [Matthew 18:20], but, oh, the backwardness to bring him in, although it would be our greatest interest at all times and all occasion to be above all things carefully concerned to bring back the King. But oh the indifferency, the unconcernedness! As was said of old, have we not kept him out until his head is wet with the dew and his locks as with the drops of the night? <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 5:2</note>  In our social visits how is the time trifled away with unprofitable subjects, how rare to find one honestly and earnestly concerned to bring in the king! Is not the ancient language applicable: Lift up your heads, ye doers, and be ye lifted up ye everlasting gates and the King of glory shall come in! Who is this King of glory, the Lord of Hosts? He is King of glory! <note resp="transcr">Psalm 24:9-10</note>  When sickness and troubles comes, then we are willing to let in this King; then, the cry is a savior or I die, a redeemer or I perish, etc. See a new book <italic>Piety Promoted</italic> by Joseph Gurney Bevans, page 41, the words of Potto Brown: a voice passed through me saying, thou must not have any conversation but what may profit thy soul. For unto that man that ordereth his conversation a right will, I shew my salvation. Thy mind must be set on heavenly things and thy conversation on heaven, and see <italic>Power of Religion on the Mind</italic> by Lindley Murray, page 123, the words of John Janeway: He was full of love and compassion to the souls of men and often greatly lamented the barrenness of Christians with their converse with each other. Oh, said he, what indifference to spend an hour or two together and to hear scarce a word that speaks peoples’ hearts in love with holiness! Where is our love to God and our fellow creatures all this while? Where is our sense of the preciousness of time? Of the greatness of our accounts should we talk thus if we believed we should hear of it again at the Day of Judgment? Does not this speak aloud that our hearts are devoid of grace and that we have little sense of spiritual and eternal concerns? In company how seldom do we find any one disposed to propose a pause, or turn our minds toward the King of Saints, or to let him in! The foxes have holes, etc. <note resp="transcr">Matthew 8:20</note>  , so the prince of the power of the air often hath the preeminence.
[marginal note] Uriah Norcross of Hopewell, a steady, orderly, innocent man, had his leg broke at Moorestown. Put his foot on the spoke of the wheel, the horses run back and broke his leg. As one day goes another comes, and oft time shows us dismal dooms.
<pb id="A0011526_024"/>
1813. See the same book page 42 P.B.’s words: may I be enabled to evince by words and actions that in conversation the Lord is to be praised and honored in stillness. Page 39 and 40 is a very remarkable account of his being at a meeting where a minister, Thomas Cox of Erith, rose up and, having appeared in public testimony about half an hour, sat down. About a minute after which, he was seized with an apoplectic fit, and expired immediately. I have been informed that John Estaugh, a worthy minister, was seized with an apoplectic fit as he was standing preaching at Haddonfield but recovered. And see the account of Robert Jordan of Philadelphia. At the house of his friend waiting for the hour of meeting, he was seized with a fit of the apoplexy and died about midnight following. See Memorials page 118: a great and laborious minister in the 49 years of his age, a minister 24 years, and see the account of Peter Fearson of Burlington, page 220: he was seized with a fit by his own fireside, which quickly deprived him of his understanding, and about 3 days after he died. He had traveled very extensively in many countries. And my near and dear old friend Joshua Evans, it was thought, died in a fit very suddenly after he had finished several extensive journeys. George Fox was suddenly removed just after he had been highly favored at a meeting and Joseph White and divers others, as I have remarked, after favored open opportunities suddenly taken away by death. Oh what solemn calls for humility and fear! How solemnly, how loudly, how awfully does it utter this language: be ye also ready.
[marginal note] Jacob Lindley of London Grove Quarter, just after he had preached most powerfully, was throwed out of his carriage his chair and broke his neck and died immediately.
{1813-09}
2. Ninth Month, Fifth Day. At our meeting. Very small, very rainy day. Ann Edwards spoke on the subject of war, etc. John Collins expressed it favored time to him and J. Roberts, but it was but a low time to me, though not the poorest.
3 was our Select Meeting. Very dull and low forepart. I said nothing till just at last and had good satisfaction and it ended savory, strengthening and uniting.
5. Was First Day. I went with Thomas Lippincott and wife to Easton meeting, which was very small and waters low but yet some stirrings of life amongst them. Then we went to see Edmund Darling and wife. A difference had happened between him and his brother-in-law Joseph Thorn, which had been carried to monthly and quarterly meeting. After an opportunity with them, went in to see his ancient mother, upwards of four-score. Then we had a sitting with a company of young people, one of the daughter a cripple (by sickness), then went to see Joseph Thorn, and in every opportunity I think there appeared tenderness and tears, so all seemed right and to end well. Yet I wanted to feel more of the savor of life and ownings of truth.
Second Day hauling out dung but I am not strong enough to do but little. See the writings of that eminent servant of the Lord, Humphrey Smith, page 330. Speaking of the fall of the unfaithful, says: and they that seek themselves shall have self enough, but self shall never help them in that day. Neither shall their own wisdom stand them instead... We read in Scripture of men that were lovers of themselves <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 3:2</note>  . A selfish spirit is a dismal thing, vastly different from the philanthropist, a universal lover of mankind. The very Indians abhor a selfish spirit. Carver, who traveled many thousands of miles amongst the Indians, says (as Anthony Benezet remarks), that there is no greater stigma (or reflection or disgrace) amongst the Indians than to say he loves himself or that any one is selfish. I believe they seen what the effects would be if a selfish spirit was suffered to have a growth: and is it not to be feared there is too much of it amongst us? Lovers of themselves, lovers of money, lovers of this world, etc., etc., more than lovers of God. Israel is an empty vine. He bringeth forth fruit unto himself <note resp="transcr">Hosea 10:1</note>  .
3rd. See [Joseph Gurney] Bevan's <italic>Piety Promoted</italic>, page 78, the words of Daniel Bowley about 25 years old, died of a consumption, in his early days had given way to folly and vanity, page 79: there is nothing equal to a proper dedication of time in health. Again, I hope the Almighty will forgive my sins; it is mercy alone that can save me. Page 81: what a favor it is to be members of our society; its rules forbid nothing that is good for us. 82: at times a comfortable foretaste of future happiness and the prospect of getting every day nearer to such an incomprehensible reward is a favor beyond expression.
<pb id="A0011526_025"/>
1813. Page 82: He remarks the many memorable instances in <italic>Piety Promoted </italic>of children from nine years old to fifteen and twenty appearing in public testimony in meetings, and further said: the great preference due to religion before earthly substance in the education of children but I have often long ago observed how earthly substance is preferred in their education, even as if it was chiefly to be minded, and where and when it is so. Is it any wonder religion is at a low ebb?
How foolish and unwise are men who are bartering their souls for gold, paltry gold. The too eager pursuit of it is a great hurt to some of our society, etc.
Page 84: our religion teaches us to believe in immediate communion with God through his beloved son, which is an unspeakable privilege to all who attend to it. 88: speaking of the wickedness in the world, he added, I would not be understood to despise the world itself. No, it is the creation of God and we are placed there to enjoy all things with temperance. If it were as it ought to be, it would be a sort of Paradise; it would be a happy pilgrimage to eternity. It is the depravity of man that makes it so detestable. In another place he says, I believe great advantage may arise from frequently comparing time with eternity, an awful eternity. Again, what would I give now for all the world? Why, nothing at all.
Then let us begin to prepare and do everything that is required of us. I believe plainness of dress is required of us, plainness of dress is as a hedge about us; the world is not then seeking our company. Do remember what our Savior said, whosoever denieth me before men him will I also deny before my Father who is in Heaven <note resp="transcr">Matthew 10:33</note>  . Be ye not conformed to this world [Romans 12:2] stands as a positive command. Oh how much of it there is in these days, and if a conformity to the world is a breach of this command and a denial of Christ before men, oh, much of it is the now in our days. I remember a remark of my dear son, Samuel Hunt, who died about the 25 year of his age. When he was a lad, he said he thought he could see but very few but what was more or less swayed by custom, or conformed more or less to the customs of the world etc.
Fifth Day 9 of Ninth Month. See Thomas à Kempis, page 186: All who are lovers of themselves are fettered in bondage, full of desires, curious wanderers seeking self Indulgence and not the things of Jesus Christ but often devising and framing. That which shall not stand, for all that is not of God, shall perish. 
At our Monthly Meeting, which to me forepart was satisfactory study: to be quiet and mind thine own most necessary business, a most interesting precept to all, and I come off pretty well latter part, although things low, dull, tedious getting along.
12. First Day. At our meeting Joseph Matlack and Ann Edwards together – Joseph especially – said a great deal.
Second Day we have had very hot weather some days past. See Thomas à Kempis’ words, page 177: son, thou oughtest to give all for all and retain nothing of thyself. Know that the love of thyself doth hurt the more than anything in the world. If thy love be pure thou shalt not be in bondage to anything about sowing rye, etc.
4: Day 15. Was at our Select Meeting at Haddonfield which to me forepart seemed low. But that worthy, eminent, able minister Richard Jordan rose up and seemed to begin but low but was raised in great eminence, and a sweet uniting time it was at last. I had good satisfaction although over wearied.
Fifth Day 16 at our quarterly meeting. Here again Richard Jordan was clothed and raised in great eminence and appeared in prayer in a lively powerful manner. He is looked upon and generally owned to be the greatest minister in the society. I wonder we should be thus favored beyond many nations and ages past. Oh, what great and powerful ministers have been raised up since the days of George Fox! I think it would take no small volume to contain the names. Richard Jordan said it was but seldom he was clothed in like manner.
[marginal note] Ann Edwards’ concern to go to the south was concluded on.
17 and 18. About home and went to my son John on business.
19. First Day. At our meeting and sweet open satisfactory one it was to me. The state of mankind as we stand in a united or disunited state with our maker illustrated. See Penn’s <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>, page 305, the testimony of the Waldences against dancing: thou shalt have no other gods but one, etc., for in dancing a man serves the person whom he most desires to serve after whom goes his heart, and therefore Jerome saith every man’s God is that he serves and loves best which his thoughts wander and gad most after. Where the treasure is there will the heart be also <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:34, Matthew 6:21</note>   says the Scripture.
<pb id="A0011526_026"/>
Second Day 20th. Ninth Month 1813. See <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>, page 345, words of Anthony Lowther, frequently professing he knew no joy comparable to that of being assured of the love and mercy of God, etc. For that he did not only think virtue the safest but the happiest way of living, commending and commanding it to his children upon his last blessing.
And see page 375, <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>; how memorable was that of origin: if my father were weeping upon his knees before me and my mother hanging about my neck behind me and all my brethren, sisters, and kinsfolks lamenting on every side to retain me in the life and practice of the world, I would fling my mother to the ground, run over my father, despise all my kindred and tread them under my feet that I might run to Christ. Yet it is not unknown how dutiful and tender he was in these relations. But, oh, to consider how indifferent, how trifling, how unconcerned the generality of the people are and, instead of being so earnest to run to Christ, run from him after trifles, so, like Esau, sell their birthright for a mess of pottage [Genesis 25:23-34]. Many sacrificing wife and children, houses and land, trample all under foot to run after strong drink and other sensual pleasures and worldly gratifications. Nay, thousands sacrificing their own very lives in the pursuit of sensual delights and the pleasures, honors, and profits of this transitory world. See the sufferings of the martyrs, etc.
See page 38, speaking of Abraham’s obedience in offering up his son Isaac, he says: so that it is not the sacrifice that recommends the heart but the heart that gives the sacrifice acceptance. The bent intent and principle desire of the heart is the principle thing. Where the treasure is there, will the heart be also.
[marginal note] The heresy of all heresies is a worldly mind says William Law. Oh, Earth, Earth, hear, oh. 
And see page 36 and 10: 
[marginal note] Woe to them that have their hearts in earthly possessions for when they are gone, their heaven is gone with them. It is too much the sin of the best part of the world that they stick in the comforts of it. And it is lamentable to behold how their affections are bemired and entangled with their conveniences and accommodations in it. The true self-denying man is a pilgrim, but the selfish man is an inhabitant of the world. The one uses it as men do ships to transport themselves or tackle in a journey, that is to get home; the other looks no farther, whatever he prates, than to be fixed in fullness and ease here and likes it so well that if he could he would not exchange. However, he will not trouble himself to think of the other world till he is sure he must live no longer in this, but then, alas, it will prove too late; not to Abraham but to dives he must go. The story is as true as sad says William Penn [<italic>No Cross, No Crown</italic>]. Some had bought land, some had married wives and others had bought yokes of oxen and could not come, Luke 14, 18: 19, 20. Is it not so now in our days? See page 15: go to the gods whom you have served, your beloved lusts which you have worshiped and the evil world you have so much coveted and adored. Let them save you now if they can from the wrath to come upon you, which is the ages of the deeds you have done. Here is the end of their work that build upon the sand, etc.
[marginal note] Third Day morning warm and dry. I am soon weary of work.
23. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Very small and silent as to me, though not one of the lowest or poorest. Ann Edwards said a little and it seemed savory.
24. About sowing rye, etc. Getting in potatoes, etc.
26. First Day. At our meeting pretty open and lively and satisfactory.
30. Fifth Day. Ann Edwards, Ebenezer Roberts, and Rebeckah Matlack set off on their journey towards Maryland, Virginia, and there a ways. At our meeting, which was very small and silent though not the lowest to me, J. Collins had some savory exhortations at last. 
{1813-10}
Sixth Day 1 of the Tenth Month. I went to Cropwell meeting which was small and the waters low yet some stirrings of life and pretty open, but I had not much satisfaction nor felt condemnation. It is a time of much prosperity people and bemired in the concerns of this world.
[marginal note] The heresy of all heresies is a worldly mind says William Law: Oh, Earth, Earth, hear, oh <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>   
And in a kind of dreaming state as to religion, as David said when the Lord restored again the captivity of Sion, we were as men that dream <note resp="transcr">Psalm 126:1</note>  . (This afternoon I brought home a load of pump logs). It operates like anodyne. Finishing sowing rye and wheat and grass seed. Visited our school to good satisfaction.
[marginal note] rainy weather.
3 of the Tenth Month. First Day. Jesse Bond from Salem had all the public service and appeared very hopeful. Heard of the sorrowful fall of Elijah Garrison, who not many years ago came out from amongst the soldiers and soon became very large in testimony. But now disowned, being charged with being the father of a bastard child soon after his second marriage. Rent rolls over rent and ruin overtakes ruin, etc.
Fifth Day Our Monthly Meeting. I could not go. Very poorly, have a bad boil. Mercy Brown, formerly Shreve, had, they say, good service and others a lively account.
<pb id="A0011526_027"/>
10 of the Tenth Month 1813. First Day. I got out to meeting again, though but poorly on. A satisfactory open time it was to me. I believe I was helped, and I thought something of a savor and solemnity attended, something owning, cementing and gathering.
[marginal note] cold changeable weather.
Fifth Day. At our meeting. Not much satisfaction. meeting small, waters low and about getting in our sweet potatoes etc. I very poorly with a bad cold.
[marginal note] helped Benne bore a pump last week. 
17. First Day. Very stormy morning. I, unwell, did not get to meeting this week. Husking corn, etc. My hired man run away and left us. I am forced to work too hard. This week coming home with a load of corn had to cross a small ditch. One of the horses, not gentle, jumped over the ditch and pitched me out of the wagon, and I narrowly escaped the wheels running over me by quickly rolling myself over. Many are suddenly killed and I can remember divers narrow escapes. Got along with work better than I expected.
Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Silent, very small; busy season and many sick.
[marginal note] weather moderate.
4. Tenth Month, First Day. At our meeting. Large and full, and to me open and satisfactory. Josiah Roberts appeared at last savory, and I thought it ended savory and well.
Second Day. Very stormy. See <italic>Piety Promoted</italic>, a new piece lately published by J. G. Bevans, page 55, an account of the sudden death of Margaret Granwood: the day was agreed on which she and one of her sisters was to be married. Each suitor had the name of John. One morning early, their father said to the two sisters pleasantly that he supposed they would not give up their Johns for any consideration whatever. Margaret replied after a pause that there was one thing and but one for which she could or would give up her John: a place in the Kingdom of Heaven. She appeared at that time to be free from indisposition, but about ten in the forenoon, as she sat employed in her knitting, she breathed her last. The preceding day she had attended the general meeting at Dent Town and had born a lively and weighty testimony  I heard the other day of the death of Moses Ashead, a young man was buried the day that was appointed for him to be married, and also heard of the death of two young men in Evesham out of one house by the name of Winer, and of the death of Nicholas Waln of Philadelphia, a great minister, and of Joseph Glovyer, in the bloom of life left a family of young children, and of divers others round about, with a kind of flux and fevers. Oh, how many serious solemn call, but, oh, how little effect they have on too too many! About gathering corn, etc.
28. Fifth Day. At our meeting. William Thorn and Hannah Dudley were married. I thought it was orderly accomplished, although not that satisfaction to me as at some time it is but rare I have a down right satisfactory meeting. About getting our corn, etc.
[marginal note] pretty cold wind.
{1813-11}
1 of the Eleventh Month. Benne and I put in a pump for the widow Thomas, 33 long.
2 of First Day last Josiah Roberts went with me to Woodbury meeting. Come off pretty well satisfied. Friends seemed very loving and inviting after meeting, as if they were not burdened with us. We dined with our ancient friend and worthy minister John Reeve. In his 84 year, and seems as bright and clear in his faculties, except hardness of hearing, as ever. Called to see my old neighbor Jonathan Morgan, in a very poorly, weakly state 76th year. Returned pretty well satisfied and is a just remark that it is a great thing to do a piece of work either in temporal or spiritual affairs so well but what when we look back we may see where it might have been mended or done better.
Hauling in corn and seldom a better crop. More than our crib full.
7 was First Day. At our meeting Hinchman Haines had much to say. Elizabeth Balderston was there and Sarah Watson, a young woman, appeared hopeful in prayer. Both of Pennsylvania.
11. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Something lively concerning the way to Heaven; it is daily by the gates of Hell, etc. About home. So warm two or three days ago that people stripped off their clothes.
[marginal note] About home. Very warm, like summer; horses sweat like midsummer. 12 S. W. 10 B.
13. Went to the burial of Mary Cowperthwaite, a young woman about 34 years old. Died with a consumption. Hinchman Haines said a great deal at the house. Changes very cold, snow a little.
14. First Day. At our meeting. I scarcely remember one to more full satisfaction. Open and owning: Choose ye whom ye will service, etc. Much illustrated.

18th of the Eleventh Month. Was Fifth Day. My wife and I and daughter Abigail went to Westfield meeting. A very stormy day. meeting small, came off middling well, I hope. We were weather bound and lodged at our cousin Henry Warrington Senr. About home, going to mill and S.
21. First Day my daughter Hannah went with me to Joshua Stokes’s.
Seventh Day Evening where we lodged first Day 21. Joshua and wife went with us to Vincentown meeting. Held in the schoolhouse, their new meetinghouse being not quite finished. They were long a gathering. The waters seemed low, a great want of lively zeal, but after a while the house was fully crowded. Nemiah Sleeper was there from Mt. Holley and had savory service, and, although I felt forepart very poor and discouraged, I had an open time to satisfaction, and it seemed to end well. People were very kind and inviting after meeting. Got home this evening and felt no cause to repent going, no condemnation. About home. Cold, freezing, clear, dry weather.
28. First Day. At our meeting. Held rather too long to please all, yet middling well. About home. My hired man sick, I have no help. Enough for me to do.
{1813-12}
3rd of the Twelfth Month. At our Select Meeting. Joseph Justice was with us as was also at our meeting yesterday and had acceptable service, although to me things seemed low. A great want of life and savor and zeal and diligence. This afternoon I went to see Joseph Matlack, who lately cut his ankle pretty bad, and they thought the symptoms seemed to threaten the Lock-Jaw, and he became much alarmed and lost his reason and a trying time they have had with him. But now seems better; he has come forth in the ministry with good acceptance of late years and became pretty large. Some months ago lost his wife – see the ups and downs and scenes of sorrow. Troubles and trials often times from quarters and ways least expected.
5 of the Twelfth Month. First Day. At our meeting. An owning, strengthening, open, satisfactory time. 
9. At our Monthly Meeting. Large and I thought it was a right dow lively time. Many pertinent lively remarks were made. How forcible are right words!
12. First Day. At our meeting. John Comly of Byberry, Pennsylvania, was there and had acceptable service – a young minister who appears very hopeful and promising, lately came forth in the meeting where that worthy minister James Thorington belonged. See the succession of standard bearers raised up. I had satisfaction and I thought it ended savory and well.
Ebenezer Roberts and Ann Edwards and Rebeckah Matlack now returned from their tour of several Months visiting the meetings in Maryland, Pennsylvania, etc. 
15. Was our Select Meeting at Evesham. John Reeves had acceptable service, but I thought it but a lowish time.
16. Quarterly meeting. Richard Jordan was very large and lively in testimony and John Reeves considerable. A favored lively time. Elizabeth Kerling also among the foremost, now very advanced in years and very feeble.
18. Killing our hogs. Just one thousand weight.
Heard of several accidents: a young man killed by the fall of a tree near Burlington, one Richards, and tis said one Gibbs, son of Lucas, was shot. A man in the Barrens went to shoot at a deer and his gun went off unexpected and shot his horse.
19. First Day. At our meeting to pretty good satisfaction I watched etc. No condemnation. About home. A considerable snow, the first this season.
Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting, very small. There appeared a lively concern in J. C. and I thought it ended pretty savory and well.
26. First Day. At our meeting. Ann Edwards took up most of the time. Stormy weather.
Fifth Day. At our meeting. To me pretty lively though small.
[marginal note] clears up moderate
{1814-01}
2 of the First Month, 1814. First Day. My daughters went with me to Evesham meeting. Although open, yet very low water. If the dead rise not all is vain <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:13-17</note>  . Pretty moderate. Getting firewood, grows cold.
Third Day night snow again.
6. Was Fifth Day, our Monthly Meeting. Forepart silent thought for business. Orderly and lively pertinent hints B. Swett was there and quite silent.
[marginal note] The black man that has worked for us several years was taken amiss. Lost the use of his hands so that we were forced to feed him. He sat by the fire four weeks or more but now moved away and another came. Young, stout, and strong, capable, obliging and trusty  as yet, so we are favored and helped along.
<pb id="A0011526_029"/>
[marginal note] A stout snow, but not very cold.
9th. First Month, 1814. First Day. At our meeting. Hannah Smith of Burlington had lively, savory service and Joseph Justice had a pretty deal to say. So came off middling, as I thought. Our meetings of late have been lively in some good degree. Ann Edwards has been large and lively since she came back, though meetings have been small on week days. Nothing very material to remark. Snowy winter weather.
[marginal note] a great rain but warm.
16. First Day. Ann Edwards was large and lively in testimony, an ornament to us.
18.On Third Day, Thomas Hawkshurst of New York and his companion John Hancock appointed a meeting at our meeting house. Thomas was large, lively, and savory. Surely mercy and goodness follows us. How we are wooed, invited, and labored with. Is it not to be feared that the turning of the Lord’s hand is not enough considered in these things? Behold, I send a famine among you; not of bread or water but a famine of the word. <note resp="transcr">Amos 8:11</note>   But we yet are favored with line upon line, precept upon precept <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 28:10</note>  . About home. A great snow.
[marginal note] Snowy again.
21. Sixth Day. My daughter, Hannah, went with me to Cropwell Meeting. The strangers from New York, Thomas Hawkshurst and John Hancock, were there. Thomas was pretty large, lively and pertinent, but the meeting was small. Divers of them should be and are looked upon the foremost class were not there. I fear meeting there is become a poor affair, very low, although there are a remnant of valuable goodly friends and some amongst the youth steady and exemplary. Oh, to think how we are favored with a free lively gospel ministry, beyond many other nations! It is to be feared it is too little considered and not enough laid to heart. 
[marginal note] A great snow, cold and still and dry.
23. First Day. At our meeting and think it was a pretty good one, open and satisfactory to me, and believe I was helped to get along. Feel no condemnation since. About home. Very cold freezing weather, a great snow.
27. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting, which was large. Notice being spread that Christopher Healey from the state of New York government and Simon Gilum from Pennsylvania were to be there. They both had savory service; Christopher was raised in great eminence and said a great deal against the deficiencies prevailing – covetousness, worldly mindedness, slackness in attending meetings, conformity to the worlds fashions, etc. After preparative meeting was over, which held but a little while, Christopher Healy requested the shutters might raised, which was done, and he had a great deal to say to us and very pertinent and lively it was. Much against the world’s fashions, a departure from plainness etc. I had some share of the time and labor with which he and J. C. appeared well pleased. meeting held very late, almost sundown when we got home. The strangers went to Newtown.
[marginal note] stormy rainy cold winter weather.
30. First Day. My wife and I both so unwell we could not get to meeting, something like a very bad cold. They say a general complaint round about. See Peter Charron <italic>Of Wisdom</italic>, first volume, page 64, concerning the soul in general: there is not in the world any one opinion which hath been more universally entertained, more eagerly embraced, more plausibly defended, more religiously stuck to (I may well say religiously, since this doctrine is, in truth, the very foundation of all true religion) than [illegible] that which asserts the immortality of the soul. All this is meant of an external and public profession for, alas, it is but too manifest and too melancholy a truth. And the prodigious numbers of epicures and profane libertines, scoffers at God and a future state bear testimony to it – that whatever pretences so ever the generality of the world may make of receiving this doctrine in words and speculations, there are but very few who express an inward sense and serious belief of it by living like men that believe it, indeed. 
Of that practical assent I shall take occasion to speak more largely hereafter. In the mean while, give me leave to lament that so little and so poor effects appear of an opinion capable of producing so many and so noble. For certainly there is not any one point, whatsoever, the persuasions of which can bring greater benefit or have a stronger influence upon mankind.  Again see page 281.
<pb id="A0011526_030"/>
Tis a just reproof Seneca gives, ye live as if life were never to have an end. The frailty of your nature is never thought of. Or if it be, tis remembered to no purpose, for at the same time that your Fears are infinite and this proves you mortal, your desires are infinite too, as if you looked upon yourselves to be immortal. Again Charron, page 282, quotes Seneca: a great part of our life, says Seneca, is run of in doing what we should not, much the greater in doing nothing at all and almost the whole of it in doing things by the by and such as are not our proper business. This is not what the apostle advised: study to be quiet and mind thine own business <note resp="transcr">1 Thessalonians 4:7</note>  , and is not this the most important, interesting business to study, to show ourselves approved in the sight of God, which is all in all? At last, again same book, page 283: some, say the philosophers, begin to live when they should make an end; others cease to live before ever they began. Among the many mischiefs that folly brings upon us, this is not the least: that it is always beginning to live. We think of business and intend to set about it, but make no progress at all, nor bring any thing to persecution, say Charron <italic>Of Wisdom</italic>.
Is it not to be feared that on retrospection many many many will have to adopt the expressions of Grotius at last: alas, alas, I have consumed a great part of my time in laborious doing nothing, and many little else but sin, which is worse than nothing. But the poet [Edward Young] says their doing nothing is set down amongst their darkest deeds.
This is not giving all diligence to make our calling and election sure or working out the souls salvation with fear and trembling like the prophet who thus expressed himself: my lips quivered, my belly trembled that I ought rest in the day of trouble <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:16</note>  , and again said another: oh, that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, etc. <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 9:1</note>  . I will not give sleep to mine eyes nor slumber to mine eyelids till I find a place for the God of Jacob to dwell in etc <note resp="transcr">Psalm 132:4-5</note>  .
Again see Charron, page 501: who (says Seneca) makes the gentleman the man whom nature hath disposed and as it were cut out for virtue? This man is well born, indeed, for the man wants nothing else to make him noble who hath a mind so generous that he can rise above and triumph over fortune, let his condition of life be what it will. Remember Habakkuk’s words as to the gentleman: the Prophet David says thy gentleness hath made me great <note resp="transcr">Psalm 18:35</note>  . So true we see it is that it is righteousness exalts an individual as well as a whole nation, making men and women as bright stars in the firmament of the Lord’s power, and as polished shafts in his quiver <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 49:2</note>   (as the prophet expresses it). Brilliant stars of the first magnitude, so we read, that they that turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the stars forever and ever <note resp="transcr">Daniel 12:3</note>  . Again see Charron page 351, 1st part: is this query – Can any greater defect or misery be imagined incident to the Minds of Men than the neglect and disesteem of their best and most useful faculties? – is not this a vastly important, interesting query on which our happiness or unhappiness depends, the improving or neglecting our most useful faculties? Again see same Book of Wisdom, page 272: and the world ought to be humbled and reformed by a serious reflection how accessory men become to their own miseries and how obstinately fond they are of them when their very remedies are industriously turned into the worst of diseases. Is not this verified in men of martial spirits, zealous and fierce for war, and in many other things wherein men purse their own wills to their own destruction? For do not many die martyrs for money and some for pleasures, honors and the profits of this world and some in conformity to the fashions of it?
[marginal note] Very cold and I very poorly, can hardly keep up.
 
[This fragment fits chronologically in the Journal that runs from 1812-1816, and the text continues below. There is also a second fragment for the same date that is slightly different but it has not been included here]
On second day the 31st of the 1st month 1814 going from my own home to T.R. [?] {I] was detained there in procuring some necessaries for my accommodation while on a little visit I intended to perform in the neighborhood of North Wales in the State of Pennsylvania, expecting to have the desirable company of my much esteemed uncle Joseph Matlack and Josiah Roberts for I had some conversation with them a few days before about my going with them desiring of them if they thought I had better not go with them to use great freedom and put me off for I had no desire to go. 
Leaving T.R. I walked on to Josiah Roberts where I took dinner his wife Mary informing me that he had gone in his chair to meet with uncle Joseph I was still [incomplete]
 
{1814-02}
[marginal note] A very snowy Day 1 of Second Month.
6th of the Second Month. First Day. Cold, stormy, snowy. I and my wife very poorly with something like a very bad cold, which prevails much in the neighborhood.
See page 484. It is an excellent petition which the Spaniards use even to proverb: Oh, Lord I beseech thee preserve me from myself. Very few, indeed have discretion enough to be left to themselves, etc. Page the first: an exhortation to study and know ourselves, a most excellent instructing discourse. 2 page: the true learning is at home and the proper subject or scene for man’s contemplation is man himself.
Page 6: would a man make it his business (as every man surely ought to do) to lead the most regular composed and pleasant life that can be, we need not go further to fetch it instruction for it than our own selves. Had we but the diligence and application as we have the capacity and opportunity to learn, every man would be able to teach himself more and better than all the books in the world and all his poring there can ever teach him.
<pb id="A0011526_031"/>
I have been so poorly I have not been out to meeting several week past. The weather very stormy and cold. Much troubled with an asthma, cough, etc., but now better.
13 of the Second Month, 1814. First Day. Although poorly I got out to our meeting. It seemed like hard work forepart, but as I endeavored to keep to the exercise and labor, it grew better. I had an open, satisfactory time; a Christian life ever found to be a life of diligence, etc.
[marginal note] Snow goes away and grows fine and moderate.
17th Fifth Day. Although it was rainy and stormy and I but poorly, I got out to meeting. Samuel Matlack and Mary Stiles were married. I thought the waters were but low, yet Ann Edwards and I had considerable to say. Though it seemed hardish getting along, not like a full flowing tide, yet all seemed to end reputably and well, according to the times. But, alas, there is such a departure from plainness and the spirit of our first Friends amongst the young generation, that it is to be feared there is but little more than the name left. Although generally concluded marriages is [are?] orderly accomplished.
See Erasmus’s work, page XVIII: If the Christian religion be true than it must be of the highest importance to man individually. It is the first concern of the whole human race. In the book called <italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic>, there it is mentioned the dreadful persecution and destruction of the Albigenses, and I think William Penn mentions it in his <italic>No Cross No Crown, </italic>and Erasmus in his book lately reprinted, page 148: two hundred thousand of these conscientious Christians and Catholics mixed with them were instantly butchered for the church. Again see Erasmus, page 145: seeing that the animosities of war produce so many and so shocking sufferings we think it incumbent on us to declare before all, both gods and men, that we are not in the least degree the cause of it. Only by pride cometh contention, says the wise man Solomon <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 13:10</note>  , and the apostle queries from whence comes wars and fightings. Come they (says he) not of your lusts <note resp="transcr">James 4:1</note>  ? Then if we should query, is it I?, is it I?, how few should we find clear of pride and of indulging the lusts of the eye and the pride of life, the very seeds and cause of it. And as pride and the lusts of the eye prevail, so people come into a state like stubble, fully dry so that a little matter sets them all in a flame. As the Apostle says, behold what a great matter a little fire <note resp="transcr">James 3:5</note>   kindereth as it is at this day when it is said not a nation to be named clear of war and dreadful battles and great slaughter and great destruction in some places. And as that of the Christian religion, as Erasmus says, it is the highest importance to men individually and the first concern of the whole human race. Yet see what William Penn says, page first, in his preface: this is the decree as old as the world, but so it is that man mindeth nothing less than what he should most mind, etc. But although this is so generally the case with poor careless mortals through life, yet when they come to die then generally we see then religion is the first concern and highest importance. Then the cry is, let me die the death of the righteous etc, oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me a Savior, or I die a redeemer or I perish etc. So here we may see the state of poor careless mankind as to religion, see the ups and downs now as in days of old. We read they served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and of the elders that out lived Joshua but afterward there arose a generation that knew not the Lord <note resp="transcr">Judges 2:7-10</note>  . Although it is too generally the case, we see as William Penn remarks, men mind nothing less than that which they should most mind and as one of our worthies said, few seem to be much careful about the state of their minds yet this hath been the awakening cry of many careless ones as I have heard, ten thousand worlds would I give if I had it in my power for peace with the Lord. I should be willing to die this very night if my peace was but made with the Lord. Ten thousand worlds one upon the back of another would not tempt me to live in the world as I have done. I desire to live no longer in this world, only on the terms of living better. A whole age were too little for the great work I have to do, now when I have not a prospect of living half a dozen hours, etc., etc., etc.
See Erasmus’s works, page 92: if we endeavor to be free ourselves from all that may encumber or impede our flight to Heaven, if we aspire with our most ardent wishes at celestial felicity, if we place our chief happiness in Christ alone, we have certainly in so doing made up our minds to believe that whatsoever is truly good, truly great, truly delightful, is to be found in his religion etc., etc. 
20 of second month was First Day. My wife and daughter Hannah and little Mary went to Evesham meeting and an owning, open, satisfactory time it was to me, more so than any I have had a long time. Helped, I hope and believe, with right and best ability. We heard of about 10 burials in about 10 days past – divers far advanced in years and some middle aged round about us – and of the mortal fever prevailing Eastward above Trenton, particularly amongst the black people. How remarkable they escaped the fever in Philadelphia. See how the horses, the cattle, the dogs and cats [in] times past were afflicted with mortal diseases, and we read he [they] slew their fish, etc.
[marginal note] Fine moderate weather.
<pb id="A0011526_032"/>
21. Second Month 1814. Our health, as Samuel Fothergill says, is no more at our command than lengths of days. When I am sick He, if He please, can make me well and give me ease. It is said those who had the least share of religion were obliged to acknowledge a divine hand in the visitation and dreadful destruction in the time of the plague in London, both in the manner of its coming in and its progress, and in its going away so unexpectedly without any new cure or remedy being found out. When many thousands died in a day and all hope to fail, so I have heard Richard Jordan divers times mention the prevailing of that mortal fever in New England that would come and rage in a town or village, then go away without any remedy or cure or medicine found out. And this mortal fever has raged all round us east, north, west and south, very mortal in places and many round about us there have many died with symptoms of that disorder.
I have seen in an ancient book giving an account of the first settling of New England, that there was a very mortal sickness prevailed amongst the Indians from east to west and I asked an ancient friend Hannah Frinch if she ever heard of it. She said she did remember their saying they thought the Indians were all going to die, for they said they died about the woods like rotten sheep, and she told me that it was then said an Indian woman was found dead in the woods with a young child sucking at her breast. 
We spent the afternoon at our son John’s in the best and most profitable manner, and it is to be feared we seldom do so. I there picked up a little book, <italic>A Sketch of the Denominations of the Christian World and of the character of the ancient first reformers from popery in divers different names and denominations of professing Christians and of their great sufferings and persecutions</italic>. See page 150, of the French Protestants called Huguenots: in 1561 on the 24 of August 1572 happened the Massacre of Bartholomew when 70,000 throughout France were butchered with circumstances of aggravated cruelty. It began at Paris in the night of the festival of Bartholomew by secret orders from Charles the Ninth at the instigation of his mother the Queen Dowager Catherine De Medicis.
In 1598 Henry the 4th passed the famous Edict of France or of Nantz which secured to his old friends, the Protestants, the free exercise of their religion. This edict was cruelly revoked by Lewis [Louis] the 14th. Their churches were then razed to the ground, their persons insulted by the soldiery, and after the loss of innumerable lives, 500,000 valuable members of society were driven into exile. In Holland they built several places of worship and it appears they were a great and favored society of people. Oh, to see and to think what dreadful work there has been about religion might shew what a great favor it is be settled in peace in the true Christian religion, which never persecuted any but breaths peace on Earth and good will to all Men. So, as Samuel Fothergill remarks, pride has ever been the cause and destruction of all the most flourishing kingdoms and empires that ever was known in the world, the downfall of one reformation after another, etc., etc.
See page 292, Reflections on the Different Denominations: truth indeed, moral and divine, flourishes only in the soil of freedom. There it shoots up and sheds its fruits for the healing of the nations. Civil and religious liberty are two of the greatest earthly blessings which Heaven can bestow on man. Thrice happy are the people who experience the benefits of good government unburdened by the impositions of oppression and who enjoy the sweets of liberty unimbittered by anarchy and licentiousness, and we should allow to others the same right of private judgment in religious matters which we claim and exercise ourselves.
Oh highly favored land of North America, what could have been done for us that has not been done and yet confusion and dissolation [desolation] seems to threaten us for want of humility and obedience. See <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>, 89, on ambition and worldly mindedness: This makes Christianity so little loved of worldly men. Its kingdom is not of this world and though they speak it fair, it is the world they love, that without uncharitableness we may truly say people profess Christianity, but they follow the world; they are not for seeking the Kingdom of Heaven first (but see how their minds change at last) and the righteousness thereof and to trust God with the rest, but for securing to themselves the wealth and glory of this world and adjourning the cares of salvation to a sick bed and the extreme moments of life, if yet they believe a life to come. I add, doth not the general language of conduct contradict a belief in a life to come? It seemed to me this sentence is a clear representation of the state of the people now in our days. For do not many live careless, as if they were never to die? Oh, that they were wise that understood this, that they would consider their latter end again; oh, that there were such an heart in them to fear me always that so it might be well with them and their children forever. Blessed is the man that fearest all ways the fear of the Lord that is wisdom <note resp="transcr">Job 28:28</note>  , keeps the heart clean, a fountain of life which preserves from the snares of death. But is it not too much banished on our days?
<pb id="A0011526_033"/>
27 of the Second Month, 1814. I got out again to our meeting. A mortifying time to me; I could not get along. He that opens and none can shut must put forth and go before or it must and will be so.
[marginal note] Burlington Quarterly Meeting very cold again.
28. Though very cold weather, I felt an engagement of mind to attend a large school near us. There was a large number of people, between 20 and 30 wagons. The teacher and school bears a great name. It’s a mixture of Friends and others, but our rules has not the ascendancy there. The house was very full, crowded with scholars and spectators, many young people and a number of elderly ones. At these times they have run much into the practice of selecting pieces, getting them by rote and saying them before the congregation. Some of their pieces are serious, composed of good matter, but many of them tend much to lightness and very much provoke or excite laughter so that at several times they were all in a titter or giggle of laughter. The young women very gay and fashionable and also the young men. There was, I thought, very much that opposed and oppressed the right spirit and yet not altogether destitute of that, neither. The young people displayed or discovered great ingenuity, gifts, bright parts, talents, genius, and extensive capacities. Indeed, I do think their carryings on and actings bordered very much on the manners of the play, actors in their theatres and tragedies, and yet for all this at last as some of us endeavored to keep serious, solid and weighty. We had an open, satisfactory time amongst them, owning and savory and, to me, strengthening. The scoffer and gainsayer silenced as far as appeared, and all ended well and appeared to be well accepted, although they were cautioned against introducing any thing amongst them that would tend to lightness. The teacher is a man of great abilities and great qualifications for school keeping but has and does yet at times very much hurt himself with strong drink. We read in Scripture that mankind were first created pure, but they have sought out many inventions, many, many, many, indeed, to their own great destruction. See <italic>Remarks on the Different Sects</italic>, page 292, the words of the celebrated John Locke: no way whatsoever that I shall ever walk in against the dictates of my conscience will ever bring me to the mansions of the blessed; faith only and inward sincerity are the strings that procure acceptance with God. Where the treasure is there will the heart be also.
Oh, how are they at their school, as above mentioned, spending their time and labor for that which doth not profit! Pleasing themselves with that which is not durable and permanent and lasting when they might be favored and honored with the company of the King of Saint, who promised to be with the faithful and dwell in them and walk in them. As the prophet said to the people of Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you whilst you be with him <note resp="transcr">2 Chronicles 15:2</note>   and David to his son Solomon also <note resp="transcr">1 Chronicles 28:20</note>  , Oh how unwise, how infatuated, to neglect so great a favor! May we not adopt the language of old: oh, ye foolish people and unwise, do ye thus requite the Lord <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:6</note>   as to forsake the fountain of living waters and hew to themselves cisterns that can hold no water <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:13</note>  : forsake the waters of Shiloh and rejoice in something else that cannot profit in the time of greatest need when every other source fails? Unwise, indeed, thus infatuated, are not a great part of the world, forsaking the waters of Shiloh and rejoicing in something else? See [John] Comly's <italic>Spelling Book</italic>, page 106: the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. With this constantly on your minds much advice will not be needful, and without it none will be effectual. If you live in this fear it will regulate every thoughts, words, and actions. 190: for this is a certain truth, that God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. The youth whose mind is thus influenced and who is desirous of contemplating the goodness of the Almighty will feel a sense of gratitude that he has a capacity given him of attaining to that most excellent of all enjoyments, a union with his Maker.
[marginal note] Some of those who have opposed the highest truths and forsaken the fountain of all their blessings have been constrained to acknowledge that is best to be serious and religious. Watch and be sober, said the apostle <note resp="transcr">1 Thessalonians 5:6</note>  .
Oh what a pity it is that this is so little considered, seeing it would lead to such a state of peace and safety here. Yea, happiness and blessedness here and hereafter. See Apocrasy [Apocrypha] Wisdom of Solomon VII, 25 verse: For she is the breath of the power of God and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty; therefore, can no defiled thing fall in her. 26: For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one she can do all things new, and in all ages entering into holy souls she maketh them friends of God and prophets. Is not all this verified in the humble, faithful, and obedient?

{1814-03}
3rd of the Third Month, 1814. Fifth Day. At our meeting, small and silent though not the poorest to me. A very severe cold, freezing time which pinches me very much.
[marginal note] so poorly I could not go to our Select Meeting.
See Barclay’s <italic>Apology</italic>, page 22: so great things (says Arathusius) doth our Savior daily; he draws unto piety, persuades unto virtues, teaches immortality, excites to the desire of Heavenly things, reveals the knowledge of the Father, inspires power against death and shows himself to every one. Inspires power against death, mark that. Is it not the one thing needful more to be desired than all this world can afford? Yea, more than ten thousand worlds as divers have expressed it at last. For what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul  <note resp="transcr">Mark 8:36</note> , and what would a man give in exchange for his soul? If we obtain the favor of this power, it is enough – we gain all. If we lose it, we lose all. Is it not strange that mankind should so little consider it and treat it with such trifling indifferency until it is too late? Thine eye shall see thy teacher, thine ear shall hear a voice behind thee, etc. said the prophet <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 30:20-21</note>   and again it is shown unto the man what is good and what the Lord thy God requires of thee to do justly and walk humbly and to do to others we would they should do to us <note resp="transcr">Micah 6:8</note>  . Ye have a more sure word of prophecy etc. <note resp="transcr">2 Peter 1:19</note>  . The law of the Lord is pure converting the soul; the law of the land is perfect, enlightening the eyes and making wise the simple. When thou gest [goest] it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. For the law is a lamp and the commandment is a light and the reproofs of instuction the way of life <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 6:22-23</note>   the law written in the heart, the law of the Spirit of life which Paul said had sat him free from the law of sin and death <note resp="transcr">Romans 8:2</note>  , and, as Samuel told Saul, obedience is better than sacrifice and to hearken to the voice of the Lord than the fat of rams <note resp="transcr">1 Samuel 15:22</note>  . Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God <note resp="transcr">Matthew 4:4</note>  .Now if we take the subjects into consideration, what a large field for contemplation, meditation and consideration, to consider the different effects on mankind - a due attention and observation of these passages of Scripture in all ages down to this day – and what influence they have had amongst men, evidently and manifestly tending to their highest happiness and safety in this world and that which is to come and the effects of disregarding them and treating them as fables in a trifling manner. And, yet, notwithstanding the effects are so evident and so clear and so vastly important and interesting to mankind, yet how are they disregarded by many until it is too late! The destruction of the old world by the flood; the destruction of Sodom by fire; the earth opening her mouth and swallowing up Corah [Korah], Dathan and Abiram; the multitudes slain in the wars and by pestilence and famine; and so down to this day, the many thousands of the poor Africans, the black people, and in the wards in Europe the many thousands that have been slain, and persecution, it is said, has thinned the world of fifty million of human beings.
So see here the dismal effect of a disregard to this righteous principle, and, on the other hand, see the blessed and happy effects of a due regard to it, as the primitive Christians were told they had passed from death to life and had come to the new and heavenly Jerusalem, to the city of the saints, solemnity and much more to that effects. The one tends to the building up in the most holy faith and the other to destruction. As David said, they have burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land <note resp="transcr">Psalm 74:8</note> , and many times since what destruction and ruin has been acted on the poor Christians in nations and ages since, banishing and destroying their places of worship, as in our first Friends. When they pulled down their meeting houses, they met on the rubbish, and in the time of last war, our meeting houses were threatened of being pulled down. One said he would go at it as free as ever; he went to splitting of rails. What has been may be; like causes produce like effect and every tree its own kind of fruits.
[marginal note] Very cold weather. I but poorly.
There is a spirit in man (said Elihu) <note resp="transcr">Job 32:1-8</note>  , and it is the inspiration of the Almighty giveth it an understanding. Now this righteous principle in all this divine inspiration and illumination and revelation, and consider the effects of it when and where it is rightly attended to and the consequence and effects of disregarding and disobeying it. It is evident it has, does and will turn the hearts of men as a man turns a water course. It turns the hearts of men (in a state of nature like a wilderness) into a fruitful field bringing forth its fruit in its season and causes the desert and solitary places to blossom as the rose. So we read I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:1</note>, etc.<pb id="A0011526_035"/>
But when and wheresoever this divine inspiration is disregarded and disobeyed, the hearts of men that are like a well watered garden or fruitful field are turned into a barren wilderness. As George Fox said when he first came forth to labor in the Lord’s vineyard, the world was like a wilderness and the spirits of men like devouring wolves, bears, lions and tigers, ready to devour him, and all the lambs and sheep of Christ full of hissing serpents and stinging scorpions. As the prophet expresses, they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider’s web. He that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 59:5 </note>  . Do we not evidently see it to be so, and that this is the different effects between a right and wrong spirit? Well might David pray that the Lord would create a clean heart and renew a right spirit within him, see Matthew 12:34. Christ calls them a generation of vipers. For we may see in our days, as in former days, the dreadful effects of the consequence of a want of the government and guidance of a right spirit, see : <note resp="transcr">2 Chronicles 15:3</note>  now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law. 4: but when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel and sought him he was found of them 5: and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitance of the countries, and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city, for God did vex them with all adversity. So now in our day, for want of attention to that righteous principle, which alone can regulate all and bring all into right order, we seem now to be threatened with confusion and desolation. Oh, it seems people did not consider the effects of this little seed, the reproofs of instruction, the way of life, that – after all these wars, blood shed, wherein the earth hath been drenched with and deluged with blood and rivers tinged with and dyed with blood – would bring people into right order and nation no more lift up sword against nation nor learn war any more. But as Job of old said, the life of man is a warfare on earth, a Christian life a continual warfare and as we read no discharge in that war.
Oh, what great and blessed attainment to have to say with the apostle, I have fought the good fight; I have kept the faith, hence forth there is a crown of righteousness laid up for me and not only for me but for all them that love the appearance of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [2 Timothy 4:78]. Oh how triumphantly and gloriously do these die saying, Oh, death, where is thy sting? Oh, grave, where is thy victory <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:55</note>  ? See Isaiah 40 chapter, 2 verse. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished, that her inequity is pardoned, for she hath received of the Lord’s hand double for all her sins. See William Penn's <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>, page 260, the sayings of Heraclitus: I have overcome pleasures, I have overcome riches; I have overcome ambition; I have mastered flattery. Fear hath nothing to object against me; drunkenness hath nothing to charge upon me. I have won the garland in fighting against these enemies, the worst of a man’s house. And the promise to the overcomers was and is, he that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life that stands in the midst of the paradise of God and of the hidden manna, etc., etc. <note resp="transcr">Revelation 2:7 and 17</note>  . One act of triumph over the temper is worth a million over our fellow creatures, and the perfect dominion of our mind is more advantageous and laudable than the dominion over provinces and nations. The one attaches merely our corporal part and is buried with us in the dust in the grave; the other follows our immortal part and passes with us into eternity. He is more a prince that rules himself than he who nations keeps in awe; who yield to that which doth their souls convince shall never need another law. Again, says Solomon, he that ruleth his spirit is stronger than he that taketh a city <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 16:32</note>  . He that ruleth not his spirit is like to a city whose walls are broken down and without strength <note resp="transcr">Proverb 25:28</note>  . As I walked by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding, lo it was all grown over with thorns, etc. The wall thereof was broken down. I saw and considered well; I looked upon it and received instruction <note resp="transcr">Proverb 24:30-31</note> . So we read in Scripture.
1814. 5 of the Third Month. A snowy day and very cold freezing weather. I poorly, confined to the house.
6. Was First Day. I got out to our meeting. I thought it ended pretty well, though not that evident owning of life as I could wish and as we have been favored with at some times. As William Law remarks, the wind bloweth when and where it listeth. 
7. As I have remarked above, the great devastations, confusion and destruction amongst mankind for want of attention to the inward teacher, that righteous principle in all and would if attended to preserve all in right order, from which through disobedience mankind have so greatly strayed and fallen away. Yet,<pb id="A0011526_036"/>
Yet, although the Apostle foresaw and foretold of a time of great falling away (from primitive purity) which came to pass, until great darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the people, yet it pleased the Lord to visit poor mankind in this most miserable, dark, benighted state, to enlighten the minds of one and another, to see into the darkness, idolatry, and superstition they had fallen in to in this dark, bewildered, benighted state. They had fallen into for want of taking heed to the light that shined in their hearts to lead them, guide them, and preserve them in safety and right order, as we may see in the book called <italic>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</italic>, where the progressive steps of the reformation are faithfully pointed out and how many valiants there were raised up to testify against the gross errors that were (in this time of darkness and disobedience) crept into the church! But as it is there observed, these were always sure to do this at the hazard of their lives. And as the prophets and apostles most if not all suffered martyrdom, so did these first reformers with thousands and millions of their followers. Now it can be nothing short of the hand and arm of almighty power that hath brought forward and carried on the great work of the reformation so far, through all the opposition of envious men and devils. And it appears to have been the settled firm belief and faith of many of the most enlightened, that the Lord will carry on this great work through and over all opposition. And these first reformers were favored to see and foretell and prophecy of the still greater and greater breaking forth of the light of the reformation. As the great master told the people in his day, your father Abraham desired to see my day and he saw it and was glad. So it seems clear that many in ages and nations since have been favored to see it. John Rutty in his diary mentions the prophecy of Jerome of Prague: viz. a new people shall be raised up that shall renounce the glory of this world and seek after the cultivation of the inward man. They shall have ministers raised up amongst themselves and elders and others officers in the church. They shall grow and flourish in the truth whilst those of human invention shall consume away like a moth. This did in a wonderful manner come to pass in and soon after the days of George Fox. Many many indeed very powerful ministers were raised up and even boys and girls from 9 years old to 14, 15, to 20 and sons of thunder that made earth to shake and tremble and see Samuel Bownas takes notice of a prophecy of William Dell in page 108, saying he would appeal to the next generation – but especially that people whom God hath and shall form by his spirit. They have the anointing for their teacher and the lamb to be their light and he thinks the author plainly pointed out our Friends society of people. In the writing of Thomas Bromley, called The Way to the Sabbath of Rest, the words or prophecy of one Moor seems very confident that the time will come when all religious denominations or sects will surely be dissolved and brought into one. And Robert Barclay at the conclusion of his <italic>Apology</italic> says, and although we be few in number in respect of others and weak as to outward strength, which we also altogether reject, and foolish if compared with the wise ones of this world, yet as God hath prospered us, notwithstanding much opposition, so will he yet do that neither the art, wisdom, nor violence of men or devils shall be able to quench that little spark that hath appeared, but it shall grow to the consuming of whatsoever shall stand up to oppose it. The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Yea he hath risen in a small remnant, shall arise and go on by the same arm of power in his spiritual manifestation until he hath conquered all his enemies, until all the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdom of Christ Jesus Then nation will not lift up sword against nation nor learn war any more and the lion and the lamb lay down together etc. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:4</note>  Oh blessed and happy days after all this dismal destruction, bloodshed, misery, and dreadful confusion! 
[marginal note] 8 of Third Month. 
Great peace have they that love thy law, said the prophet David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 119:165</note>  . My peace I give unto you; my peace I leave with you. Not as the world giveth give I, said the great master <note resp="transcr">John 14:27</note>  . That peace we read of that passes all human understanding – George Fox calls it the King of Kings his peace. Who can set forth the excellency of a peaceful and tranquil mind? It is a paradise, say the Spaniard, according to Charron’s account. One would wonder (said William Hunt my dear cousin on his death bed) all the world did not seek after peace of mind. It is such an excellent treasure at such a time as this; what would all the world avail me now if had not this peace? And this hath been the language of very many at last: some lamenting the want of it and some rejoicing in the possession of it. Is it not the one thing most needful, the pearl of great price, a precious jewel, more to be desired than silver, and the gain thereof than all the gold of ophir, which all together could not pay any ones passage from earth to Heaven? Oh, how prone we are to pursue lying vanities and forsake our own mercies!<pb id="A0011526_037"/>
Again, Paul, I think it is, thus exhorts, follow after those things that make for peace and those things whereby one may edify another [Romans 14:19]. Now is not there means and a way provided for all in all ages to attain to and obtain this greatest highest felicity? As Erasmus says, he that wisheth a man health wisheth him a valuable blessing but he that wisheth him peace wisheth him the highest felicity of human beings– so Seneca and divers others that I have read of agreed. To be favored with peace of mind and to obtain the approbations, union and communion with our great creator is the highest pitch of Christian perfection. Although the fields should yield no meat, said Habakkuk, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation etc. <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>  . 
Now here, as I take it, is the means provided for mankind to attain to this blessed and happy experience is clearly pointed out by William Penn in his advice to his children at the conclusion of his <italic>Select Works</italic>: I (says he) have chosen to speak to you in the language of Scripture, which is that of the Holy Ghost, the spirit of truth and wisdom that wanted no art of direction of man to speak by and express itself fitly to man’s understanding, but yet that blessed principle, the eternal word I began with to you and which is that light, spirit, and grace, and truth. I have exhorted you to in all his holy appearances or manifestations in yourselves, by which all things were at first made and man enlightened to salvation: is Pythagoreus, great light and salt of ages; Anaxagoras, divine mind; Socrates, good spirit; time in unbegotten Timaeus, unbegotten principle and author of all light; Hierons, God in man; Platos, eternal ineffible and perfect principle of truth; Zenos, maker and father of all; and Plotinus, root of the soul, who as they thus styled the eternal word for the appearance of it in man, they wanted not very significant words. A domestic god or God within, says Hieron, Pythagoras, Epictetus and Seneca; genius, angel, or guide, says Socrates and Timeus. 
The divine principle in man, says Plotin. The divine power and reason the infallible and immortal law in the minds of men, says Philo; and the law and living rule of the mind, the interior of the soul and everlasting foundation of virtue says Plutarch, etc., says William Penn, conclusion of his <italic>Select Works</italic> and page the last, 861, in his <italic>Advice to His Children</italic>: it is a noble measure sufficient to regulate the whole. They that have it are easy as well as safe; no extreme prevails, the world is kept at arms end, and such have power over their own spirits, which gives them the truest enjoyment of themselves and what they have: a dominion greater than that of empires. O may this virtue be yours! You have grace from God for that end and it is sufficient. Employ it, and you cannot miss of temperance nor neither the truest happiness in all your conduct. 
See again page 849: For God is and will be with his people in his holy dispensation we are now under and which is now amongst us unto the end of days. It shall grow and increase in gifts, graces, and power, and luster for it is the last and unchangeable one. And blessed are your eyes if they see it and your ears if they hear it and your hearts if they understand it, which I pray that you may to God’s glory and your eternal comfort. Penn’s Advice to his Children and as Richard Jordan lately said it was his faith and belief that as long as there was men on the Earth there would be some professing and maintaining our principles or to that effect. Again see Penn’s Advice to His Children, page 850: mind an inward sense upon doing any thing. When you read the Scriptures, remark the notablest passages as your spirits are most touched; in a common-place book with that sense or opening which you receive. For they come not by study or in the will of man no more than the Scripture did and they may be lost by carelessness and overgrowing thoughts and business of this life. So in perusing any other good or profitable book yet rather meditate than read much. This Advice of William Penn to His Children of keeping a common-place book, etc., and to keep an account of every day, though a day should require but a line – he said many advantages flow from it, was what first put me upon thus keeping such a common place book, as he calls it, nearly in my first beginning with it. My dear cousin William Hunt was here and I shewed it to him and he seemed much pleased with and encouraged me in it and once in company with Anthony Benezet he told me I should keep such a book, and I told him I did, and he seemed pleased to hear it, very much encouraged it. But sometimes I am ready to think of burning it all, as some have done in times of poverty. But sometimes it seems very agreeable to look over it. But, alas, when I recur to this query what lack I yet, I am ready to conclude that which is wanting cannot be numbered.

[marginal note] page 852: keep a short journal of your times, though a day require but a line. Many advantages flow from it, says William Penn.
<pb id="A0011526_038"/>
9 of the Third Month 1814. A very stormy day, which much affects my cough and health very poorly.
10. Fifth Day. Our Monthly Meeting. I was ready to conclude it was hardly worth while for me to go, but the weather clearing up and I got better, I did go, and there I found Christopher Healy again, and an highly favored, open, owning time it was. Both meetings held from 10 to half past 3 and I was favored to sit it out. Christopher Healy had a great deal to say in both meetings, and I had a considerable share in the labor with him in the first meeting. I had like to have been up before him with the same words he mentioned. We were nearly united in the labor, seemingly as if we had been brought up at one school together, exactly suited, as it used formerly to be with my dear old friend, Joshua Evans and John Simson, seemingly to suit one another’s turn. Christopher’s testimony was very savory, against the many deficiencies prevailing amongst us.
11. I and my daughter Hannah went to Evesham Monthly Meeting. Christopher Healy was pretty much shut up first sitting; only appeared in supplication on the queries. C.H. had a good deal to say, but I thought the waters were low and a want of life and savor, which seems to be the state of that meeting. Christopher and I went in to the women’s meeting and had a pretty open, satisfactory time with them. He was very pertinent and lively against the prevailing fashions and conformity to this world’s ways, etc.
12. Seventh Day. Christopher went to Upper Evesham Monthly Meeting, and I was informed had very acceptable service amongst them. Now in the Ninth Month he is about to marry a young woman in Bucks County, one Miller. Many not well pleased with it.
13. First Day. My wife and I and daughter Hannah met Christopher Healy at Cropwell. It was a very large full crowded meeting, and Christopher was raised in great eminence, although the waters seemed low at first. I thought it was like throwing a little water in a pump (as R. [Robert] Barclay expresses it) and working it; it brings up the rest. So Christopher was favored to evidently show his certificate signed and sealed by highest authority. We dined at Joseph Rogers’s, where was a number of young Friends with them and the family. We had a good opportunity together. Then we and Christopher and his companion, Job Collins, came home with us to lodge, and a very agreeable satisfactory time we had together.
14. Second Day morning my wife and I and daughter Hannah went with our friends to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. Christopher was silent forepart and but little in meeting of discipline to say (this was a disappointment to a number that run after him). 
15. I went with Christopher Healy and Job Collins to Nathan Lippincott’s at timber Creek to lodge Third Day. We had a meeting at their schoolhouse. A very stormy day, the meeting small. A number of Methodists were there and appeared very attentive. Christopher was highly favored to show his best certificate, signed and sealed this afternoon. Had a meeting at the county poor house, between fifty and a hundred paupers. I am told Christopher had a very open, satisfactory time with them. It was a very stormy time; I, poorly, did not go with them. This evening we had a very satisfactory time in the family.
16. Fourth Day. I was taken very sick and with vomiting, but came with Friends up to our select meeting at Haddonfield. But I was so poorly I could not sit meeting but am told that Christopher Healy and Richard Jordan had very open acceptable service.
[marginal note] An ancient woman burnt in her house at Timbercreek, one Thackery. We seen the walls standing on our way to N. Lippincott’s.
17. I got along again to our quarterly meeting. Christopher Healy and Richard Jordan had very extensive acceptable service, but I was so poorly I could not sit the meeting quite out. Christopher Healy is a very comely little or middle sized man, about forty years of age yet has had eleven children. His wife died with the prevailing fever not very long ago. He seems like something picked up in the wilderness: not brought up at the feet of Gamaliel nor at the academics schools or colleges, but, like the prophet formerly, by opening his ear to discipline and the tongue of the learned is given him to speak a word in season to the weary traveler [Isaiah 50:4]. Has a very clear pleasing delivery and an uncommon, free, open, sociable, loving turn towards all and so travels with very great acceptance. An evident sign that mercy and goodness yet following and striving with the people, in thus raising up instruments to labor to turn the people from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to the power of the Lord. Heard of the death of three old Negroes. One died very sudden. Old Dinah dropped down in her house and died instantly.
<pb id="A0011526_039"/>
20th of the Third Month, 1814. First Day. I went to our meeting (with all our family except our hired black man) under a feeling that I was ready to say in my heart, woe is me for I am undone, so I felt under a sense and feeling of my frailties and weakness, yet not overcome. Yet for all it was an open owning time to me an unmerited mercy yet continued. What shall we render, etc., the calves of our lips <note resp="transcr">Hosea 14:2</note>  . Oh, for the blessing of preservation and deliverance from evil, etc.
Seventh Day. Fine and warm, some stripped off of their cloth. Next day grows cold, 2nd snow storm. When I was at Nathan Lippincott’s at Timbercreek with Christopher Healy I laid hands of the writings of Thomas Bromley, called <italic>The Way to the Sabbath of Rest</italic>, and of the journeys of the children of Israel, and of extraordinary dispensation together with the writings of Thomas Hartley and William Dell. Truly altogether excellent. Many sentences I could and should write down if I attended to William Penn’s <italic>Advice to his Children</italic> as I have observed on the last leaf. So many sentences were so striking, so excellent. I have read this book some years ago and much recommend it and wish they were more published. See Apocrypha, Eccleciasticus 11:10 verse: look at the generations of old and see; did ever any trust in the Lord and was confounded? Or did any abide in his fear and was forsaken? Or whom did he ever despise that called upon him? 
And see Isaiah 24:16: from the uttermost parts of the earth have we heard songs glory, even glory, to the righteous, and that in every nation, kindred, color, tongue, or people.
In a public paper it is said: died at Jamaica (at Falmouth) on Tuesday 15 ult: Ann Sylvester, a free black woman at the very advanced age of 133 years. She lived in the neighborhood of Duncan at the time of the earthquake, which happened at Port Royal in the year 1692, and from her own account must have been about 15 years old. She had at one time children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to the number of 82. It is somewhat remarkable she never lost a tooth from the time she was grown up, nor ever wore spectacles as her eyesight was sufficiently strong to do common needlework till about a fortnight before her death. She was a motherly, humane creature, was much beloved among her neighbors and retained her faculties to within a few minutes before her death. Thus, as the prophet said, from the uttermost parts of the earth have we heard songs, even glory, to the righteous <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 24:16</note>  . We have very much such an account of an old black woman who said she could remember the first house for worship built in Philadelphia. She died a few years ago, upwards one hundred years old. Richard Dill [Dillwyn?], visiting families at Moorestown when we were there reading the account of her, said she had ferried him over the river at Dunkin’s Ferry divers time or a many times.
24. Third Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Cold and stormy snow and rain. The meeting very small but not the poorest to me; helped, as I thought, beyond all expectation and so came off without condemnation but with satisfaction, which is more than ten thousands of witnesses as to the outward.
See Bromley, page 4, speaking of the narrow way that leads to life and of the cherubim flaming sword whose office is to cut off all corruption from the soul so that the least grain of selfishness or flesh cannot enter the Kingdom of heaven – we are to be stripped of all the riches of corrupt nature and [leaves off there].
See Do. page 37th: selfishness without much self-denial and watchfulness may spring up in a new dress after very great and high attainments and very great favors. 2: so also they may break in upon us from large and eminent gifts of the spirit, and we may take too much complacency in the pleasant fruition of them, even to an hindrance of our looking up to the fountain as all in all. And soon very excellent indeed, for after we have been upon the mount of divine visions and openings we may expect 109: to be led into a more humbling dispensation to (Hadarah), great fear and trembling that so we might not be elevated but still keep lowly under the cross. Saint Paul seemed in some such state, Corinthians 2 and 3rd: I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. 110: When it pleaseth the high and holy one he can let out such terrors upon us for our humiliation. I heard Thomas Ross, a worthy minister, once say it is a great thing to keep self down, a very great thing indeed. If it be true (which I believe it is), he that conquers himself conquers his greatest enemy because then his greatest enemy, the Devil, hath nothing in him to work upon. Is it not at this door, [the] self, the subtle twining serpent enters? And see what dreadful work he has made among the children of men.
<pb id="A0011526_040"/>
See also in page 113 of Bromley’s Journeys of the Children of Israel, the effects of self-will exalting itself against God’s will in the dreadful case of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Tempting us to do so, which to comply with is as the sin of witchcraft, 1 of Samuel 15: 23, in opposition to which any constant business or work is to break our wills and labor after a moral annihilation of them, as ever remembering that of our Saviour. If any man will or come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me, Luke 9:23. This is the true way of preserving ourselves from the sins of Israel. Page 239: in giving the spirit power over the flesh to subdue it and to check its wandering imaginations and earthly affections, that so, these being in order, the spirit may enjoy divine silence in conversing with God and angels. For it is in reference to this inward man or spirit of our minds that we are said, Ephesians 2:6, to sit in heavenly places. See same book, Thomas Hartly’s words: oh, ye sons of men, turn your eyes to the great bedlam of the world, where its valaries are running mad at such a rate after folly and riot, where invention is racked to lull conscience asleep, and where millions are racking themselves to spiritual slumber in the cradle of death, and treat every faithful watchman that sounds the alarm to rouse them from their false peace as the enemy of their repose. Cast your eyes I say on this theatre of vice and frolic this fair of vanity, where Prince Abaddon holds his perpetual jubilee and say which of these two schools, Christianity or the world, turns out the greater number of mad folks. Which would an angel, an angel, pronounce most rational and sound in mind? The sordid race of Manmonists, the giddy tribes of pleasure-seekers and the fantastic tribes of fashion followers? Or the poor, broken hearted Christian lamenting his sins and misery and in the power of divine grace working out his salvation with fear and trembling and following a desired Jesus through mockery and derision to eternal blessedness and glory? If you are not of the number of the infatuated, you cannot hesitate a moment to resolve the question a right, for wisdom is justified of her children.
So Thomas Hartley concludes his discourse on mistakes concerning religion with the words of Dr. Moore’s, preface to that of godliness, viz.: 
There shall be most certainly a time when the sun of righteousness being risen, Egyptian mists and darkness shall be dispersed, when all the filth and dross of the church shall be consumed and purged away by the ardor of divine love, when all barbarity of manners and filthy superstitions and idolatries shall be sent into the lake of fire and brimstone, when finally Calvinism, Lutheranism, Popery, and whatever other distinctions shall be melted down into one (which shall be instead of all) truly Catholic Apostolic Philadelphianism. Which times that God would hasten and there unto incline the hearts of Christian princes and people ought to be the fervent desire and prayer of all good men. 
Same book, next follow the works of William Dell. Page 87 says: for faith is a work of the spirit of power, etc. 88: and thus the Holy Spirit is a spirit of faith in us and so a spirit of power. For unbelief keeps a man in himself, but faith carries a man out to Christ. Now there is no man weaker than he that rests on himself, and there is no man stronger than he that forsakes himself and rests on Christ. And so a man through the power of faith is able both to do and endure the selfsame things which himself did endure. Page 109: all Christians stand in need of the power of the spirit to enable them to perform duties, to perform them aright – that is, spiritually. For spiritual duties may be performed for the outward work, carnally, and in such duties there is no strength but weakness, because there is none of the spirit in them. For there is no power in any duty except there be something of the spirit in duty. There is no more power in praying, nor in preaching, nor in hearing, nor in meditation, nor in reading, nor in resisting of evil, nor in doing good, nor in any duty of sanctification or of mortification than there is of the spirit in them and according to the measure of the spirit in each duty is the measure of power in the duty. If there be none of the spirit in a man’s duties there is no power at all in them, but only weakness and deadness and coldness and unprofitableness. If a little of the spirit, there is a little power, and that duty that is most spiritual is most powerful, and therefore St. Paul saith, I will pray with the spirit and will sing with the spirit etc. <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 14:15</note>  . And all the worship of the faithful is in the spirit, Phip. 3:3. We are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and have no confidence in the flesh, so that there is no more power in any duty than there is of the spirit in it,and there is no more acceptance of any duty with God than there is power in it. Same book, last page but 2, penitence illustrated etc. Had I now a thousand worlds I would give them all for one year more that might present unto God one year of such devotion and good works as I never before so much as intended.

See page 16 (the last page in that book) of Bromley’s: I could have called in as many helps, have practiced as many rules, and been taught as many methods of holy living as of thriving in my shop had I but so intended or desired it. Oh, my Friends! A careless life unconcerned and unattentive to the duties of Religion is so without all excuse, so unworthy of the mercies of God, such a shame to the sense and reason of our minds, that I can hardly conceive a greater punishment than for a man to be thrown into the state that I am in to reflect upon it.
Their doing nothing is set down amongst their darkest deeds, says Young, the poet, on resignation.
See Bromley, page 471: thus St. Paul asserts the Galatians to have been bewitched, chapter 3:1, Satan showed his artifices in leavening their minds with erroneous principles, notwithstanding they believed and had received the spirit, verse 2 <note resp="transcr">Galatians 3:2</note>  . And by parity of reason all those are under some degree of this enchantment who stick in outward worship and outward ceremonies, observations, whither invented by men or instituted by God, I say, who stick in them as to neglect any degree of internal piety or purity, holiness, mortification and universal obedience. For as St. Paul assures the Galatians, In Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision <note resp="transcr">Galatians 5:6</note>  , but a new creature.
Is it not to be feared many of all sort content themselves with the performance of a round of religious duties without the evident renewings of life? If it were not so, surely there would be more of the evident tokens of that. We read of the ointment of his right hand bewrayeth itself <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:16</note>  . As the damsel challenged Peter, saying, thou are one of them; thy speech bewrayeth thee <note resp="transcr">Matthew 26:73</note> . This, I have thought of late, is much wanting amongst many, if not all – even the fore rank amongst us hiding their talents in the earth instead of letting our lights so shine before men that others seeing our good works might glorify our Heavenly Father. I have of late thought, I have seen if this was more seen, the ointment of his right hand betrayeth itself, there would be a right gathering of the people to the peaceable, Shiloh and they would flock to us as doves to the windows. 
See Bromley, page 168: one species of mystical idolatry is the immoderate love of ourselves, 2 Timothy 3:2, or the letting out that fullness of affection to any creature which is only due to God whom we are to love with our whole heart, but nothing else so; thirdly, the reposing too much confidence in ourselves or in any other person or things besides God, whither it be riches, honor, power, on wisdom, etc. And see Bromley, 229 of extraordinary dispensations, speaking of the administration of angels and the good we receive by them. After setting forth and proving by Scripture the many and great advantages we receive by them, he says, but is it so that we enjoy such happy privileges by their constant attendance. How then should we carry ourselves before these bright flames of fire, these chariots of the great Jehovah, which carry God’s name in them? If princes were continually conversant with us, how should we fear to commit any absurdity in carriage! But how much greater are the angels than earthly princes! Zach 6 and 4 Danl. 10:17: how cautious then should we be in our conversation before them, how much declining all speculation, and active pollutions, all vain imaginations, uncomely speeches, idle discourses. How ready are we to please even the unreasonable humors of those we converse with that so we may avoid offence. How then are we obliged to suit ourselves to those who, besides their protecting us, are so pure and spiritual that we are sure to lose nothing, yea to gain much, by our conformity to them! Do not they rejoice at the conversion of sinners and delight in our happiness! Ought not we then to rejoice in affording them cause of joy, and delight to delight them? For it is extremely unjust to retaliate nothing for their kindness to us. And how can we express ourselves to them but by oft and serious reflections upon them, by living like them in constant communion with their and our God and with them in him; as likewise by discoursing, praying, and singing together. For in such things they delight and take much notice of our carriage in divine worship. 1 Corinthians 11:10: which place, though it unfold a deep mystery, yet it also discovereth the presence of angels in holy assemblies and our duty to demean ourselves accordingly. See Bromley 108: and one reason why so few enjoy such things to strengthen themselves and others is in that most stick in some part of the eternal life and have the powers of their souls weakened and chained up by it. They have not wholly left Egypt but adhere to some part of this lower world with irregular desires, yet undiscernibly under the disguise of Christian liberty, etc., etc.

27 of the Third Month, 1814. First Day. My daughter, Abigail, went with me to Westfield meeting, which was in a good degree open and satisfactory generally so as far as appeared, yet I believe there is great room for improvement in solidity, depth, and weightiness. We heard of several now laying ill with, tis said, the typhus or nervous fever.
29. We were invited to the burial of David Haines, son of Stacy, about 22 years old. Died with the nervous or typhus fever. I am so poorly, I cannot go out. Bad colds are very common. It seems I took a fresh cold going to Westfield meeting and have been very poorly with my old complaint, asthmatic cough, etc.
See a little book called <italic>Religious Tracts</italic> by Anthony Benezet, page 58: watch carefully over thine inward man, for in him is contained all the happiness of man, Proverbs 4:23. Remain fixed in watching over thyself till thou art freed from selfishness. Nature must always be watched over, 1 Corinthians 9:27, and one misstep produces another. Keep clear from every thing which may captivate thy will; do not seek to please the earthly or fleshly appetite.
30. Fifth Day. Very stormy. I have been very poorly several day and several of our family. None of us got out to meeting in this great rain and pretty heavy thunder.
{1814-04}
1 of Fourth Month, 1814. See Samuel Bownas’ Journal, page 189: I went to see or visit a friend that was much afflicted with lowness of spirit and in a despairing way, although he had from his youth been a very sober and orderly man. But providence having favored him with considerable substance, he imagined he transgressed in having everything too fashionable and to rich, and did not serve his maker with his substance as he ought to have done. This was a great load upon him. Page 190 he says, I gave this poor, despairing friend another visit and found him much out of order, which made it unpleasant to be with him. 
[marginal note] This, as far as appear, was in 1726, 1727, or 1728.
Oh, for the way everlasting, which David prayed for, the sure foundation which stands the storms. On page 185, Bownas says: this evening as I was going to bed, about ten at night, there was an exceeding great earthquake that made a noise like the driving of carts or wagons over an uneven causeway. It continued about 2 minutes to the great surprise of the people. It was felt about fifteen hundred miles, as was after computed and was thought by calculation. Was not quite three hours in going that space. Page 190, he says he had intelligence by letters from his friends, further accounts of this great earthquake before noted how that at Newbury, Haverill, Aimsbury and places adjacent it continued for fourteen days and was felt a long way on the banks of the Moremack [Merrimack, Bownas says Maramack] River. The account was confirmed by many who felt it, who declared themselves afraid to remain in their houses during the several shocks, which returned every twenty four hours, continuing about the space of three minutes. The inhabitants did much blame themselves for their pride and luxury, taking this to be a judgment upon them for those things. Our first Friends wrote long epistles against pride and luxury, and frequently used these expression: surely will not the Lord visit for these things. And how many since have taken their afflictions to be as judgments for their pride and disobedience in these things? Many, many indeed, I have noted. And see Thomas Chalkley’s journal page 300. In the year 1737 in the forepart of the tenth month: the night 11 hour before he parted with John Fothergill after his third visit to America, was an earthquake which was the greatest known in this province – the whole city of Philadelphia being shaken, and most parts of the adjacent provinces, though little or no damage done thereby, which shows the abundant mercy of a merciful God, as also, if it were the pleasure of his will, how soon he can lay cities and countries waste and desolate and bury thousands in a moment. But notwithstanding the mighty power of the eternal Jehovah, oh, how hard are the people’s hearts and how they hate to be reformed and how unconcerned are the inhabitants of the land about their eternal peace and well being! This is really lamentable. Oh, how do earthly-mindedness, pride, covetousness and drunkenness abound with many other evils which were scarcely known amongst the first settlers of this peaceful and now plentiful land of Pennsylvania. So for Chalkley. See Numbers 16:32, the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up Korah. Dathan and Abiram, Psalms 106:17.
See John Rutty's Diary, page 46: an earthquake lately shook England, Portugal, Ireland, Holland, Germany and France, etc. 
[marginal note] Going to Westfield I got some cold, and my cough returned, and I have been very poorly all this week.
See my memorandum 9 of 1 Month 1812, see Seneca’s Morals page 378, meditations on earthquakes and consolations against them. He says in Asia twelve cities were swallowed up in one night. And see [Lindley] Murray's <italic>English Reader</italic>, page 138: the earthquake at Catanea fifty-four cities with 
<pb id="A0011526_043"/>
with an incredible number of villages were either destroyed or greatly damaged. Catanea in particular was overthrown, and although the earthquake did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thousands of the inhabitants perished in the ruins, and not a footstep of its former magnificence was to be seen. Seneca says scarcely a greater instance of the uncertainty and changeableness of worldly things than that of the burning of the city of Lions [Lyons] in France. From a great and flourishing city in the space of twelve hours was burnt down. And see Sewel's <italic>History</italic>, page 525, the City of London was turned into rubbish and ashes insomuch that after an incessant fire which lasted four days, but little of old London was left standing, there being about thirteen thousand and two hundred houses burnt. Thomas Briggs foretelling their destruction if they did not repent as Nineveh did <note resp="transcr">Jonah 3:1-10</note>   and does not the signs of the present times seem to threaten us with dissolation [desolation] after divers ways and divers manners: the alarm of war, famine, and pestilence. See Exodus 9th and 24th and see Genesis 19:24. What an account of a dreadful indignant and thee the account of Thomas’s story of the terrible earthquake in portrayal in Jamaica in 1692, when a great part of the city was sunk and many hundreds and perhaps thousands perished in a few minutes by an earthquake. In the year 1665, one year before the fire in London, more than 4000 died in one week of the pestilence. See II Kings 19:35, the angel of the Lord slew one hundred and fourscore and five thousand in one night. In sacred and other histories a solemn night be collected of the dismal doings amongst the children of men which by obedience and true humility might easily be prevented, see Psalms 78 and 48 verse.
3 of the Fourth Month. First Day. I am so poorly I could not go to meeting. From the account my wife and daughter, gives there was something pretty lively amongst them, Lidi [Lydia?] Lippincott, Ann Edwards, Josiah Roberts and J.C. Some lively exhortations but a sorrowful account that Joseph Matlack has got down low in mind as ever. About the middle of Third Month 1812 I seen a letter at J.C. from Redstone giving an account of the earthquake very lately amongst them Ohio and the Western territories. So terrible that the brick and stone houses cracked and shook as if they would fall and caused them to scream and cry out in a dismal manner and marked their faces, it is said, with seriousness, sadness and gloominess in divers places. But these things wear off and seem soon forgotten, as it has been remarked after the plague in London. It is said things soon fell into their old channel, and as we have seen after the fever in Philadelphia, when several thousands were swept away in a few months, so that now after having been thus visited year after year, As soon as the storm is over things return to their old channel, so that very little marks or signs of amendment or reformation to be seen, although in the midst of these calamities many were much alarmed and many promises of amendment mad when the streets were left desolate. The people fled many houses, left desolate, great, and fair without inhabitant. But so we read it was the Children of Israel when delivered from Pharaoh and the Red Sea; they sang his praises but soon forgot his works.
7 of Fourth Month, 1814. Fifth Day our monthly meeting. I have been so poorly I could not go to meeting. John Comly of Byberry and Sarah King of Burlington quarter, growing young ministers, they say were lively and acceptable. See how they are raised up here one and there another.
10. First Day. Although I was very poorly I went to our meeting. Through weakness of body and mind I, fear I withheld more than was best, but as it was, through diffidence and fear, did not tend much to my own poverty, but fear I came away in debt to some. Ann Edwards seemed to have hard work getting a long against a worldly spirit. It’s like going against Goliath.
I seem to have not much very material to remark except this Hinchman Haines lately returned from a religious visit in New England Nantucket and there aways and says there is great scarcity of bread in that part of the country – rye 3 dollars a bushel and scarcely to be got at all, so that some families have lived weeks together without bread. Observe the alarming calls in our land. Abroad the sword devoureth at home it is as death <note resp="transcr">Lamentations 1:20</note>  . Sword, pestilence, and famine, etc., sorrow on the seas it cannot rest.
12. Ann Edwards and her sister was here to see us. To satisfaction, as appeared. They inform that the prevailing malignant fever has been in the poor house in Burlington County and that twenty-three have died there in a few weeks and divers lays now very ill with the fever round about Evesham. William Haines of Evesham, a young widower, buried yesterday, died with the fever; several more very ill.
16. Seventh Day. Went to the burial of my half sister Elizabeth Hunt. Died at Hope Stokes’s, her sister. An open satisfactory time. Our neighbor, George Githins was buried this afternoon with a few days illness; the language of mortality all around. John Stone an old man [rest of sentence scratched out].
<pb id="A0011526_044"/>
17 of the Fourth Month, 1814. First Day. Yearly meeting. I not able to attend it. At our meeting small, several gone to Yearly Meeting, came off middling. I hope none appeared to be burdened, although I thought the waters low and life wanting.
 
{1814-04}
[This fragment falls here chronologically in the Journal that runs from 1812-1816. The longer Journal continues afterwards]
Leaving home first day morning the 17th of the 4th month 1814 at 6 o’clock, walked to Wm. Cooper’s ferry landed at [indecipherable] Street ferry and proceeded to Joseph Stokes’ near the North Meeting House, where I attended meeting beginning at the tenth hour, also at 4 o’clock afternoon.
18th of the month and 2nd of the week. After about 10 minutes spent in solemn silence the introductory minute was read. The representatives of each of the quarterly meetings were called and they answered. Some few sent reasons for their not being present. It was then proposed for Friends who had certificates to produce them to the meeting early which being done they were next read Epistles from all the Yearly Meetings with which this usually corresponds were produced and read to much satisfaction and a large Committee appointed to make and prepare replies to each of them. The representatives were desired to propose to the meeting a suitable person for Clerk and one to assist him. Meeting adjourned till three o’clock in the afternoon.
At which time Friends again assembled. Thomas Scattergood on behalf of the representatives proposed John Cox for Clerk and Samuel Beddle to assist him which the Meeting concurred with and they were accordingly appointed for this year. The minutes of last year was read over and such parts of them as needed to be considered was done. Next the minutes of the Meeting of Suffering were read over.
The Meeting then adjourned till 9 o’clock tomorrow morning.
19th of the month and third of the week. Friends again assembled pursuant to adjournment. Samuel Smith spoke a few words at the opening of this sitting. The meeting then proceeded to the Queries and Answers. After the first Query was read and the answers from the several quarters to the same. Some very good remarks were made to the deficiencies that appeared in our members by the answers by Wm. Flanner, Jesse Kersey, and several other Friends. Kersey observed that is parents were rightly concerned for themselves their souls being made alive in Truth that children would be benefited by observing that was the case with the father whose soul and that of his son would come to be bound in one and the same communion.
Third Query was read and it answered. John Baldwin very strongly recommended a strict adherence to primitive plainness. 
Fourth Query and its answers were read. Fifth one also with and next after the Sixth Jacob Lindley said that there was abundance of publications in this age of the World but the scriptures outweighed them all.
 
21. Fifth Day. Very stormy. This day Job Collins, son of John, is to be buried in the prime of life, with the typhus fever as they call it. A very fresh, healthy man to all appearance; lay ill about one week. Left 5 small children. Six have died in a few weeks within a few miles of one another in Evesham.
24. First Day. I am informed that one N. Rulon, on his way to the yearly meeting at or near Woolwich or Mullica Hill, was struck with the palsy and died in a short time.
See Charron <italic>Of Wisdom</italic>, first volume, page 478: all the world are actors and play their parts to please the audience <note resp="transcr">Pierre Charron, 11541-1603. French philosopher and Catholic writer. <italic>Of Wisdom. 3 books. Written originally in French</italic>. First published 1594.</note>   (and see what is said in Scripture: all that which they do is to be seen of Men). And it was well observed by a wise man that none are good except such who are so inwardly and by themselves, and virtue is always the same – as cautious, as prudent upon the account of conscience as it is in obedience to the public laws and customs of the World; as fearful of offending one’s own self and as careful to avoid condemnation of one’s own breast when no eye sees us as it is of the observation and reproaches of all mankind. Page 479: there is one thing more fit to be observed on this occasion. A sad and wicked thing it is, viz. that Men, being depraved by a kind of hypocrisy natural to them, have taught themselves and others to make a greater conscience and be infinitely more scrupulous and concerned for their outward behavior, although the moderating our passions and the regulating our whole life and conversation depends upon a due attention to the dictates of conscience. And yet the former – that is, a greater concern to conform to the ways of this world – will degenerate into formality, of course, and by insensible degrees grow cold and negligent in regard to that of keeping a clear conscience.
This 24 of the month I got again to our meeting, although but feeble and weak and the wind very harsh and cold. And had no cause to repent it, came off without condemnation and with a good degree of satisfaction; know ye not your own selves, etc. <note resp="transcr">2 Corinthians 13:5</note>  .
Fourth Day morning. Some trying things and gloomy prospects: our hired black man has run off now in the midst of our plowing.
See Charron, of wisdom, page 451: fullness and plenty is one of the most troublesome things in the world and instead of helping forward does but provoke us to nauseate our happiness (but it seems not like at present we shall be much tried or troubled with fullness and plenty).
Gross ease love does like gross diet pall:
In queasy stomachs honey turns to gall <note resp="transcr">John Dryden, 1631-1700</note> 

The greatest interruption to our enjoyments and the most distasteful thing that can happen to us is abundance. To be cloyed is to loose all, and as the old proverb is, plenty makes dainty and the full stomach loathes the honeycomb <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:7</note>  , so I have observed that. It is said the Christians formerly, when under their greatest suffering, they were most favored with divine power and the influence of Heavenly goodness. But from time to time when they were relieved from suffering and tried with peace and plenty they lost ground in religion, as we read Jesuran waxed fat and kicked <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:15</note>  . The primitive Christians said that prosperity was a very intoxicating thing and few brains were strong enough to bear it, and is that not very evident so in many instances down to this day? Our first Friends suffered great persecution and great was the labor and concern of many of them in soliciting the rulers and powers of the earth for their release and enlargement, and at length when that was obtained, one of the most noted cried out, not all the persecutors, open apostates and enemies we have ever had in the world ever hath done as that hurt that prosperity has done. It appears prosperity hath ever proved the greatest and most fatal trial upon virtue. As one said, oh, prosperity, prosperity, what hast thou done? This was the charge formerly: when thou hast eaten and art full then beware lest thou forget the Lord [Deuteronomy 8:10-11], etc. Beware lest your hearts deceive you and ye be drawn aside after other gods, etc. <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 11:16</note>  , said the prophet.
<pb id="A0011526_045"/>
25th of the Fourth Month, 1814. I heard of the death of Thomas Scattergood of Philadelphia, an eminent worthy minister, generally beloved and of an unblemished character. About sixty, was taken ill with the prevailing malignant fever on Fourth Day, the week of the yearly meeting. ’Tis said he was at meeting and was buried Second Day following. And of Joseph Hance, in the midst of his days buried near the same time. Died of the prevailing fever; lived toward Salem, where they say sickness much prevails. Whole families died with it, and it is said many are very sickly now in Evesham.
[marginal note] A great rain. They have been frequent, great, freshes [freshet].
28. Fifth Day. We went to Evesham meeting. Some little signs of the stirring of life, and but little and that among the youth. Waters very low.
[marginal note] very warm
{1814-05}
1 of Fifth Month. First Day. At our meeting. More animation, more evidence of the ownings of best ability than is common. Oh, what a favor yet extended, oh, that I may with Mordecai and Daniel return and sit at the king’s gate <note resp="transcr">Esther 3; Daniel 2:29</note>  . For what sustaineth one day will not do for the next; give us this day our daily bread, etc. <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:11</note>  . We hear almost daily of some dying with the malignant fever. Last First Day, a black man died with it at Joseph Lippincott’s on Pennshawken Creek and Third Day, a young man about twenty  years of age, a son of Isaac Coopers on Coopers Creek. It is said he was an orderly young man. Heard of two men killed by the wheel of their carriages running over them; and how many times have I seemed to narrowly escape. Very much tried with disappointments in getting a man to plough; now several have failed.
[marginal note] very warm.
5 of Fifth Month our monthly meeting. Something lively and savory at times, but I unwell.
8th of Fifth Month. First Day. At our meeting. It was not a satisfactory one to me; no savior, no life. As one observes, viz., Moses West, who writes well on the subject of marrying near kindred, says the loss of peace of mind is the greatest of all losses. So on the other hand the gaining or obtaining peace of mind or peace of conscience is the greatest of all blessings. If people did consider it to be so, how could they go to meetings in a state of ease and indifferency or lukewarmness when so great a treasure is at stake as peace of conscience? And the loss of it the greatest of all losses, which undoubtedly is so, and all find it to be so when he that rides the pale horse approaches. Very much tried with disappointments in getting help now in the midst of plowing time. I am informed that it is in newspapers an account of a very great fog in England, so that many people lost their lives and many horses. It was so thick and dark that carriages ran one against another and people got so lost and bewildered that they could not find their own doors. And also an account in the news of a very great frost in Carolina that destroyed their cotton and the seed of it, so that the loss was said to be irreparable. Job Scott mention a frost in his journal, so it seems now as formerly, call after call, after divers ways and divers manners. Planting and getting ready; very wet weather.
[marginal note] See the difference last First Day. I feared nothing; now, everything.
Fifth Day. At our meeting. Small poor and low, although little A. Edwards had sweet acceptable service. I thought I seen clearly that many were very much settled down, very contented and easy in a way very far from the right best more or most excellent way. Very many have taken up a rest short of the true rest and so remain till it is too late. Then this hath been the cry of many, oh, for a little more time, though a whole age were too little for the work I have to do! Kept it to myself, what would a man give in exchange for his soul? Ten thousands of worlds if I had it in my power, has been the language of divers.
It is so very rainy we cannot go on with planting corn. Oh, for that blessed state mentioned by Habakkuk: although the fig tree shall blossom, neither fruit be in the vine, the labor of the olive should fail, the flocks be cut off from the fold and there be no herds in the stalls and the fields yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation, etc. <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note> 
[marginal note] What a strange thing it is that a little health or the poor business of a shop should keep us so senseless of these great things that are coming so fast upon us. Yet so we see it is. 
<italic>Penitence Illustrated under the Character of Repentance: Respecting the Cares and things of this world </italic>[Fenelon]. These things are now sunk into such mere nothings that I have no name little enough to call them by. For if in a few days or hours I am to leave this carcass to be buried in the earth and find myself either forever happy in the favor of God or eternally separated from all light and peace, can any words sufficiently express the littleness of everything else? the greatness of those things which follow after death makes all that goes before it sink into nothing. Had I now a thousand worlds I would give them all for one year more, that I might present unto God one year of such devotion and good works as I never before so much as intended! The case of many a one, no doubt.
<pb id="A0011526_046"/>
Penitence Illustrated etc.,
Oh, my Friends, a careless life unconcerned and unattentive to the duties of religion is so without all excuse, so unworthy of the mercy of God, such a shame to the sense and reason of our minds that I can hardly conceive a greater punishment than for a man to be thrown into the state that I am in, to reflect upon it! To be found in on with the works of T. Bromley, last page.
[marginal note] Very rainy weather.
15 of Fifth Month, 1814. First Day. At our meeting (although I was unwell). Much wet weather affects my health, numbness and pain in my head, hardly able to sit or think, but yet thoughts suitable to the time and place was not so much wanting as life and ability. Seldom if ever do I remember a meeting more destitute of life and savor. About planting, but so much wet weather we cannot go on with it.
19. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Although the waters very low, I thought I was favored with ability to labor hard, and it seemed as if a spiritual slumber was ready to sweep all before it. Yet I came off with a good degree of satisfaction. A few days ago a new barn was burnt with the lightning near Haddonfield. It is said a lad was in the barn and some horses but neither of them hurt. Oh the many awful calls! But how little or lasting impressions do they make on our minds and how soon forgotten.
22. First Day. At our meeting. Silent and very destitute of life, a very low time.
[marginal note] very great rains frequent.
26. Our preparative meeting. J.C. and me had some remarks on that of indolence. Joseph Justice was there but silent; meeting small. How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me <note resp="transcr">Judges 16:15</note> ? He that loves God serves him; he that does not, neither doth nor can serve him however great acts of outward devotion he may perform, said John Staupits, one of the first Reformers. None can serve two masters <note resp="transcr">Matthew 24:6</note>  , whatsoever people love that their hearts run after. Many are very lively in worldly business who are very dull and drowsy in religion; if they were as lively in religion as they are in worldly affairs, there would be great room for hope. Turn to and read James Gough's Epistle, page 171 and 172: the state of some meetings in his days, poor lifeless meetings. Thus have some meetings died away and are lost, and others appear to be in a languid, sickly condition, seeming scarcely likely to live long unless they timely apply to the great and good physician, etc.
29. Fifth Month. First Day. Rebekah Hubbs was at our meeting. Found hard getting along this afternoon. John Baldin of Pennsylvania appointed a meeting at our meeting House. People come pretty freely and plentifully, but, alas, their expectation were too much outward. He spoke very well, but yet very little animation. As James Gough observes, they can labor but feebly where the hearts of the people are not prepared to receive.
{1814-06}
[2.] Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though very small, more lively and satisfactory to me than some of late.
[3.] Sixth Day was our select meeting, a very poor, low time. See James Gough, Life, page 48 and 49. I thought of what we read: where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty and there is ability. But there was as little of this sort as I ever seen at a meeting of that sort. No satisfaction.
First Day, 5 of the Sixth Month. My wife and I went to Evesham meeting, very low and poor forepart, but grew better. Hinchman Haines and Priscilla Wells, a new beginner, both had something to say which seemed to help the meeting, and after them I had an open, favored, owning time, good satisfaction. Oh, how open, free, and near people seemed to be after meeting! I went to see William Austin, who had got very badly hurt helping move a barn. Several of them were weighing down on a large pry or hand spike, the rest jumped off suddenly and it flew up and tossed him up and he fell down and the pry fell on him broke his collarbone and several of his ribs and mashed his breast so that his life is much despaired of. He is sensible though in great misery. So true it is as one day goes, another comes and sometimes shews us dismal doom. He appears to have been an innocent, orderly man and seems resigned and willing to leave this world. Has a wife and good estate but no children to leave. He died soon after.
[marginal note] He died in a few days.

T. Bromley, <italic>Journeys of the Children of Israel</italic>, page 168: mystical idolatry, one species of which is the immoderate love of ourselves. 2 Timothy 3:2: or the letting out that fullness of affection to any creature which is only due to God, whom we are to love with our whole heart but nothing else, so by the reposing too much confidence in ourselves or in any other person or thing besides God – whether it be riches, honor, or wisdom etc. Little children, keep yourselves from idols <note resp="transcr">1 John 5:21</note>   said the inspired penman. Then should we be safe enough from danger, if we kept this command: thou shalt have no other God before me. But, alas, how many are the idols and how doth idolatry greatly abound in the love of earthly things! In another place it is said, they shall all go into confusion together that are makers of idols <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 45:16</note>  , and is this the cause why all nations it is said are now at wars and dismal confusion? The heresy of all heresies is an earthly, worldly mind, says William Law. If so, how much does it abound! The rumors of wars and clouds of confusion seem to increase and gather blackness, offering and tempting the young men with great wages and land if they get the victory, so they are enlisting by hundred and going off to the seat of war at Canada and the Lakes. Great turnings and overturnings and rumors of wars we hear in Europe.

[marginal note] a long cold storm.
See Thomas Colley’s Sermon, page 6: with respect to the first principles of the doctrine of Christ and the universality of that grace which comes by Jesus Christ, which being dispensed to the children of men in an individual capacity is the foundation of true religion, the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and the wellspring of all spiritual strength and real substantial joy and comfort. And see Humphrey Smith’s works, page 304: he gave them his spirit, which all the circumcised in heart do rightly know to be the chiefest goods.
9 of Sixth Month. Our Monthly Meeting. Somewhat lively stirring amongst us.
11. Seventh Day. Went to the burial of my ancient, kind friend Joseph Burroughs, aged near eighty years. Very kind he has been to me. A vast number of people, but, oh, the want of an inward travel for the arisings of life! Though still and orderly, things as to the life very low. I was very poorly and had not much satisfaction.
12. First Day. At our meeting. Micajah Collins of Lynn, near Salem in New England, was there and was large in testimony on the solemn subject of prayer, but, oh, the dullness and drowsiness that attended the people, many of them. As one formerly prophesied, there should be powerful preachers and dull hearers, good sermons would be as music to a sleepy man, and as in the prophet it is said thy voice is as a pleasant song, etc., <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:32</note>   fullness of bread and abundance of idleness, and Ann Edwards after him, but if the dead is not raised preaching is in vain <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 13:14</note>  . Formerly we read [that] the word preached did not profit where the hearts of the people were not rightly prepared to hear <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 4:2</note>   and that in some places Christ did not many mighty work as to the care of the body, and for themselves many are lively enough. Their appearance testify to that in the dress and glittering jumping chariots, glittering harness, and fat, nice matched horses, etc., etc. We have had a long time of wet, very cloudy weather so me think the harvest is likely to be hurt for want of more sunshine.
15. Fourth Day. At our quarterly select meeting at Evesham. I thought there was something sweet, savory and owning forepart. Simon Gilum of Pennsylvania and Micajah Collins were sweetly exercised in their gifts, answering the queries. Life seemed to lower but growed better again and on the whole a pretty good satisfactory time, though I was over wearied and poorly weak and feeble. Heard of the death of Jacob Lindley of London Grove Quarter, a very great and powerful minister. ’Tis said he and his daughter set off from home for Philadelphia in a chair, got but four or five miles and he fell down and died immediately. Thought to be an apoplectic fit. A solemn and awful call to all to be ready at a short warning.
[marginal note] Two days sunshine, which is rare this season. J. Lindly, it is said, was killed with the fall, broke his neck.
16. At our quarterly meeting. Micajah Collins of Lynn near Salem in New England was clothed and raised in a very distinguished manner, savory and very lively and large and several others, Simon Gilum and some others. A favored time, but afternoon on business – three appeals and some other very disagreeable business.
[marginal note] Very great rain again.
See Humphrey Smith’s works, page 203, To the imprisoned flock of God: or shall we not be contented if the Lord should suffer us to be deprived of all things but himself – yea much better it is to enjoy the Lord than life itself. And as Abraham Gibbins said, life is not worth having without peace; it certainly is all and all at last the only and alone the one thing needful, because all other things come to nothing at all.
[marginal note] in page 163 is a very close remark to ministers.
<pb id="A0011526_048"/>
19 of the Sixth Month, 1814. First Day. See Psalms XCI: that state of the righteous, their safety, their habitation. He that dweleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty, etc. The whole chapter most excellent and see chapter next or XCII: in the multitudes of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul, etc. I sat under his shadow with a great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste, said another. Oh desirable, happy, and blessed experience! Oh, for the inward life, the hidden life, the life that’s hid with Christ in God, as we read. See Psalms CVII, a most precious chapter. Again see Job V, chapter 20 verse: in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword; 21 thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue, neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh. Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth, for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace, and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin. Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth; 26 thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like a shock of corn cometh in his season. Lo, this we have searched. So it is, hear it and know thou it for thy good. And see Habakkuk’s words: though the fields yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>  . But alas, where are our minds taken up? May not many say, woe is me that I dwell in Mesheck and sojourn in the tents of Kedar <note resp="transcr">Psalm 120:5</note>  ? Oh earth, earth, hear oh earth, etc. <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>  . Where the treasure is there will the heart be also <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:34, Matthew 6:21</note>  . What can all the treasures of the earth do for us at last?
[marginal note] Rainy, cloudy, so wet cannot tend our corn. Vast great burdens of grass, but little sunshine be to dry it.
Went to our meeting. It is better (according to Solomon’s word) to sit as a fool and appear as a fool than really be one in offering up the sacrifice of fools. I suppose all do who perform their religious duties not in the ability God gives, etc. A poor low time, not much satisfaction. Now about getting hay, fine weather and a fine crop of grass. If humility and gratitude were not wanting all would be well.

Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Something savory, lively, and satisfactory. It’s a great favor when there is any good stirring to have a share and sense of it and not be like the heath in the desert that knows now when good cometh <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 17:6</note>  . Very busy getting in hay and favored to get along, though I am forced to work too hard. 
First Day. At our meeting a very poor low time; people work hard and nature calls for rest. Many very drowsy; hard stemming the tide of spiritual indolence. Yet at last, almost too late, I thought I was a little helped to some satisfaction.
[marginal note] Fine hay weather. Got in eight tons of timothy and clover, sweet and very good.
Fifth Day. At our meeting small, dull, and poor and drowsy though I believe generally struggling against it, and I believe some got the better of it at last, and some quite overcome.
[marginal note] rainy morning
26 of the Sixth Month. First Day. One of our ancient worthies viz. Moses West says the loss of peace of mind is the greatest of all losses. So then the gaining or obtaining peace of mind is the greatest of all gains, more than all earthly treasures, joys, pleasures or delights. See William Dell’s words page 88, Bound with T. Bromley: unbelief keeps a man in himself, but faith carries a man out to Christ. Now there is no man weaker than he that rests on himself and there is no man stronger than he that forsakes himself and rests on Christ. So saith the Prophet: trust in the Lord and lean not to thine own understanding <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 3:5</note>  .
[marginal note] Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord, <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 58:14</note>   joy and delight of all others the most pure.
{1814-07}
3 of the Seventh Month, 1814. First Day. My daughter Hannah and I went to Evesham meeting and a lively, open, owning one it was to me and as far as I know satisfactory to all.
4. Reaping by myself. There seems not much dependence on these strangers: black men we hire. However mine has run off and left me. Just beginning harvest, our man came back, and we got on again with our business.
7th of Seventh Month. At our Monthly Meeting. Small and very dull forepart but at last I thought it ended pretty well and savory. I and my man reaping and mowing, etc.
Seventh Day. Our sons John and Benjamin with some others, about seven or eight hands, and we got all our harvest down, thirteen or fourteen acres, very cleverly, quiet and still. David prayed to be upheld by the Lord’s free spirit <note resp="transcr">Psalms 51:12</note> , so we are helped along and upheld. Although the winter and abundance of wet, cloudy weather which was feared would hurt the harvest and its like. It did cause it to be very light in many places, yet we have more and better harvest than last year. I hear that a few weeks ago there was a very hard wind, thunder, and hail which tore down much timber, cut their Indian corn much, and beat down the rye a few miles above Ancocas meeting house. How many ways to be deprived of the fruits of the [word unclear, earth?].
[marginal note] Exceeding the joy of harvest one said he knew no joy, riches, treasures like that of being assured of the favor of God. Crops fail, a prospect of scarcity at Ohio we hear.
<pb id="A0011526_049"/>
[marginal note] Very dry weather; much show for rain but all goes off.
Look back at 1 Month 9th: Charron on immortality and William Penn 
10th of the Seventh Month, 1814. First Day morning. See John Griffith’s Journal, 420: The general consent of all ages and nations to that of the immortality of the soul and future rewards and punishments and although the professor of Christianity were favored with more clear apprehensions thereof than others, yet numbers of them live as if they had no such belief or as if they did not look upon themselves to be accountable creatures. This remark seemed to correspond with my own prospect and sight of great numbers and has been much on my mind in my contemplations and considerations of things. I have called, but ye have not answered; when you call, I will not answer but will laugh at your calamity and mock when your fear cometh <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 1:24-27</note>  . A dismal state beyond expression, vastly different from that of being favored of the Lord. Eye hath not seen nor ear heard what the Lord hath in store for his faithful children <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 2:9</note>  . When the Lord riseth up what shall I do, and when he calls what shall I answer him <note resp="transcr">Job 31:14</note>  ? This is the cry of poor sinners who have lived as without God in the world: at last, what shall we do to be saved? What good thing shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? A savior or I die, a redeemer or I perish. So it is and so it has been. In their calamity they poured out a prayer, etc. Again, see John Griffith’s journal, page 416: what a powerful efficacious thing Christianity was when it made its first entrance into the world! And so continued for a considerable time, mightily prevailing by its own force and efficacy against all opposition and worldly interest until the world smiled upon its professors. It then spread as to the name, but gradually losing the power and the life; many disorders, great corruptions, and desolating contentions about trifles got in, and this, I have oft considered of late, would be the case if religion is suffered to go to decay. The world would become like a wilderness, the spirits of people would become like the briars and thorns and filled with spirits like lions and bears and wolves and like hissing serpents and stinging scorpions. And like, as expressing scripture, like stubble fully dry, and then behold as the apostle says: what a great matter a little fire kindles <note resp="transcr">James 3:5</note>  . And as George Fox says, when he was first sent out in the Lord’s service to arouse and awaken the drowsy world, it was like a wilderness filled with devouring, voracious beast like lions, bears, wolves, etc., all ready to devour him and all the lambs and sheep of Christ, and many died in prisons and other ways under their cruelty and grievous oppression, more cruel than the beasts of the wilderness.
Went to our meeting. Unwell; numbness and pain in my head. Although not destitute of suitable thoughts, but great want of that that quickens and makes alive. People work hard in this the midst of harvest. Dullness much prevailed, yet little A. Edwards appeared in prayer.
[marginal note] A fine rain after several weeks dry.
Second Day morning. See Memorials, page 344, Sarah Morris’s words: Oh, that the people would but believe that in thy peace their strength consists and that they would more generally seek to know it before it be too late. But too many are contented without witnessing the frequent renewings of divine love in which only there is life. If they are but preserved from gross evils and go on in prosperity they sit down easy and think all is well. But, Oh! that they may not too late find their mistakes and that they have pleased themselves with favors which they have unthankfully received and so stopped short of greater by not desiring them full of other guest like of old. This is a great confirmation to me respecting my thoughts and prospects of the state of many of latter time.
[marginal note] I hear of great accounts of the grain being blasted at Salem and other places.
10 of the Seventh Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting. A lively, open, strengthening time to me, and J.C. about getting in our harvest and sowing buckwheat, etc. Begins to pinch with drought.
17. First Day. At our meeting, a poor low time to me. Unwell, hardly able to keep up. J.K. appeared again and A.E. in prayer, but I thought a low time in general. About getting in hay and favored to get along with it beyond expectation, but I am forced to work quite too hard at it. Use limbs and have limbs; the blacksmith's arm is strong, says the proverb. I am better able to work than I have been in several years.
[marginal note] Second Day rainy morning.
21. At our preparative meeting and a lively satisfactory one it was to some, I believe. Elizabeth Collins was there and had very savory, weighty service; by the [thee] have I run through a troop <note resp="transcr">Psalm 18:29</note>  . Man’s understanding dulled through idleness contracts a rust that makes it less and less a prince, says Chilon, see <italic>No Cross, No Crown</italic>, 254th page. Must not take up his time about transitory and mortal things; eternal and immortal are fittest for him.
[marginal note] It is better to wear away than rust away.
<pb id="A0011526_050"/>
1814, First Day, 24th: Seventh Month. See <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>, page 254: a prince, says Chilon, must not take up his time about transitory and mortal things; eternal and immortal are fittest for him and indeed are not they fittest for all of all sorts. But alas, to view the state of mankind in general, how are their minds and time taken up about transitory and trifling things which amount to nothing and come to nothing, whilst eternal and immortal things are lamentably neglected to their irreparable (and it is to be feared) everlasting unspeakable loss. To think how much precious time is lost in unnecessary unprofitable thoughts and unprofitable conversation! As formerly we read many walked after things that did not profit and loved to wander as we see at this day. And what a pity it is that the mind should be thus trifling when it has so great and glorious a work to do. What a pity that one minute should be lost in unprofitable thoughts or conversation! The righteous that hold on their day do not do so. As John Woolman remarks on his and my cousin, William Hunt, that he heard him say in public testimony that he was so given up to the service of his great master that he did not desire to spend one minute to please himself, and his conduct corresponding with it was animating or stimulating to him. If I be a father, where is my honor and if I be a master, where is my fear etc. <note resp="transcr">Malachi 1:6</note>  ?
Oh, says Thomas à Kempis, that I could spend one hour or half hour after the best manner, and William Penn says (I think) that he could hardly wish a man better than that he was in a way of making the best use of his. Another said at last that he repented of all his life long but that part which he spent in communion with God and doing good. Certainly this is the wisest way and the effect the most glorious at last. It is remarked by divers wise writers the last words of Grotius, on observing his assiduity or devotedness, etc., he cried out, alas I have spent a great part of my time in laborious doing of nothing. So it is to be feared many will find it who are almost if not altogether taken up with the cares and concern of this world. The summer over, harvest gone, and we are not gathered. Who can calculate the loss? Is there a possibility of avoiding this loss by any other way or means than by coming to a state of true resignation? Oh, said David, send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me and teach me <note resp="transcr">Psalm 43:3</note>  , and again we read as many as are led by the spirit of God are the Sons of God. Then what a pity we should be led by a wrong spirit in spending our time in unprofitable thoughts and conversation when on the one hand there is such unspeakable gain and on the other such great loss. Went to our meeting. An open, lively time although it held rather too long to please all. Very busily engaged getting hay. I seem forced to work too hard quite. See Matthew 6 and 26: the fowls of the air sow not nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly father feedeth them and John Woolman says, page 336: Nor do I believe infinite goodness and power for us in this life, etc.   Very excellent remark follow. See John Woolman, page 329, and to strive for riches which frequently introduce oppression and bring forth wars and grievous calamities, and as Chilon says riches brings forth luxury and that tyranny and I think barbarity. grievously afflicting on another. My neighbor C. French was reading an account in the news of a dreadful malignant mortal disease in Mexico like a pestilence or kind of fever that twenty six thousands died in the space of about one summer.
See Amos IV: 10 chapter, I have sent among you the pestilence. How often has this been done in many ages and nations down to his day, and of latter times in our land, east and west, north and south hath a mortal fever swept away great numbers.
[marginal note] They flocked to their places of worship as in the time of the plague in London. When the judgments of the Lord are in the earth then they learn but righteousness.
Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though small, a number of friends from neighboring meetings were there. A committee met on business from the quarter and it was an owning, healing, uniting time. Open and pleasant after meeting to me. We have had several weeks of fine, dry hay weather and many chiefly done but not all.
[marginal note] They flocked to their places of worship as in the time of the plague in London. When the judgments of the Lord are in the earth then they learn but righteousness.
Fifth Day night and Sixth Day: An exceeding great rain. Had it come a week or 10 days sooner, it would have swept away much hay.
31. First Day. At our meeting. A rainy morning. meeting small and very poor to me. Finishing getting in oats and hay.

4 of Eighth Month. Monthly Meeting. Forepart to me was lively, at last not so. Penney Town meeting not allowed.
See [Thomas] Bromley’s <italic>Journeys of the Children of Israel</italic>, page 183, the seven nations of Canaan which Joshua cast out prefiguring the works of Jesus, casting out the evil properties they signify out of our souls: 1 the Hittites, signifying the spirit of fear and discouragement; 2nd the Amorites, the bitter fierce talking and judging spirits; 3 the Canaanites, the merchandizing spirits. 
<pb id="A0011526_051"/>
[Upper portion of the manuscript is worn away.]
[Words unclear]
4 Nation are the Perizzites; 5 are the Hivites, the talking notional that move us to talk of vain thoughts and imaginations and fill our fantasy with empty romances, etc., etc. As William Shewen says, vain thoughts are great troublers of the world: oh, how do they rob thousands of their precious time!  
6 Nation are the Jebusites, figuring the spirit of pride and elevation etc. Gentile like saying, what shall we eat drink and wherewithal shall we be clothed? Oh, how greatly they abound and grievously they crop and spoil the tender vine, and what great need there is of their being driven out and destroyed, seeing they rob us of so much time. 7 Nation the Girgashites. These are earthly, dirty spirits that tempt and draw us to the earthly life and its vanities, to bestial lusts, to excess in all things against the law of moderation, purity, temperance, etc. And all these spirits fight in us to their last breath, even till they are quite destroyed by the powerful resurrection of Jesus in Spirit in us and his ascension in us, which is our perfection in the life and nature of the son of God, who will at last cast them out of the fallen humanity and himself reign there over them all to eternity, amen hallelujah. Oh, these earthly spirits, how they abound! Oh, earth, earth, hear, Oh, earth <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>   etc. Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:21, Luke 12:34</note>  . But how quickly are they driven out when he that rides the pale horse appears to approach <note resp="transcr">Revelations 6:8</note>  ; then they must turn out and give place to their betters.
[marginal note] cloudy, rainy weather.
5 of Eighth Month. My daughter Abigail went with me to Evesham Monthly Meeting. Claton Brown and Hannah Andrews were there, and a more open time I seldom seen, and I thought there was a good degree of life and savor, something more than words, in both for worship and discipline. Claton said a very great deal, and I believe both he and I had many very pertinent sentences and remarks but am doubtful whether we did not rather overdo it more than they could well digest. As Thomas Ross said, get under sail in a pleasant river and fair wind and tide, there is danger of running by the right landing place and so forced to land in the mud. Yet on looking it over, I hope and believe there were many pertinent profitable remarks. Claton’s testimony was much against a worldly, earthly spirit which prevails. I hope it may be as bread cast on the waters and found after many days, but this earthly state of worldly mindedness is a state very hard to reach or move.
[marginal note] Seventh Day. Finishing our hay work, etc. Our barn as well filled with hay, wheat, rye and oats as ever, or nearly so. What a favor yet continued.
7 was First Day. Nathan Smith of Philadelphia was there and had large acceptable service. This afternoon, Nathan Smith went with me to visit Samuel Church, his family. We had a religious opportunity; Nathan had a considerable deal to say, and I believe it was a satisfactory, profitable time. This family are newly moved amongst us and hopeful friends. He married our neighbor Abraham Matlack’s daughter.
8. Second Day Morning. An exceeding heavy great rain but clears up and we went to the burial of Mary Hollinshead, 78 of age, wife of Jacob Hollinshead. The people behaved very still and orderly and I had something to say amongst them. Nathan Smith came to me whilst I was speaking. I not knowing he was there. They proposed moving the corpse too soon and prevented Nathan from clearing himself. Oh, the want of feeling members in such cases! There is a great improvement at burials with respect to order and stillness and not enter into conversation as formerly, but yet a great want of a right exercise and inward deep travail.
See Humphrey Smith’s book, page 108, the love of God declared and Satan’s wiles discovered, the effects of despising little things. But let such mark and observe themselves, for no more unto them is committed, neither do they grow or come any further but there stand as dry plants, coming long to meetings, having the form, but not feeling the power. For such who deny their obedience in anything to the light of Christ, he will deny them his power in all things. Thus many wiles and ways doth the enemy watch to devour. And see do. page 114: They follow witchcraft who obey not the truth which makes free, whose seed, like Cain, whose seed loves that which keeps from the Lord and leads into the witchcraft (like Saul), not obeying the Lord nor his son. If so, then how great are the bewitched, lunatics, and heretics? As we read, Oh, ye foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth? <note resp="transcr">Galatians 3:1</note>   
[marginal note] Dry weather, though some little showers. Grows dry.
11 was Fifth Day. At our meeting. Lively with some, though small. Divers gone to Woodbury Quarter. Ebenezer Roberts entered the list of combatants first time.
[marginal note] Dry and very very warm, dog days, very hot.
14. First Day. At our meeting. Not the dullest and most shut up, but not much satisfaction. Heard of the death of Joseph Engle, near eighty, has been a quiet, still, industrious man. He was taken ill on Third Day and was buried First Day – has been a healthy, corpulent man.
18. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though small, sweetly satisfactory. If there were a few pieces of silver stake – as it were, a reward for them that did right – would it not engage our attention to do so that we might obtain the reward, etc.? We read of a merchandise that is better than silver and the gain thereof, better than gold and of that which cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall gold or silver be weighed for the price thereof and that the price thereof is far above rubies.
<pb id="A0011526_052"/>
21 of the Eighth Month, 1814. First Day. My daughter, Hannah, went with me to Cropwell Meeting (I have not been there some months). Though small, I do believe it was an owning, open, favored time. I scarcely ever remember to have seen and felt more openness and feeling nearness and shew of kindness after meeting than then appeared amongst us.
[marginal note] Grows very dry weather.
Since the 21 I have been at our meeting divers times, but nothing material to remark except it is lowness, dryness, poverty, and formality. A state of ease and unconcernedness too prevalent, notwithstanding we have very fresh alarming accounts of dreadful destruction with the warlike people and it seems to come nearer and nearer home. The English lately landing an army of men and attempted to take the President at the federal city on Potomac River, Maryland. Did not take him, but burnt his house and divers others, to the loss of many thousands of dollars and the loss of many hundreds of lives, they say, and several hundred taken captive.
We hear that it is a pinching, trying time with the poor over in the western territories; grain scarce and provisions very dear, and so it seems to be here. Divers say they do not think the last harvest on the whole was more than half a crop and their distilleries destroy abundance of rye, all which makes it very scarce and dear – rye now dearer than wheat and very few. Eastward we hear of the scarcity of bread, but both bread and meat dearer here than I ever remember. Pork from 18 to 20 and upward per pound.
Joseph Matlack, of whom I remarked a few months back – see 9 of Ninth Month back – a few days ago hanged himself. He had got brave for some weeks past and got to work and stayed with his family, but they discovered that he was growing worse and more disordered again in his mind. Oh, the scenes of sorrow! He was an ingenious man. He had a very heavy spell of the fever when a boy, lay near a week almost like a corpse but got well and married very well, raised a family of fine children. His wife died, as I have remarked, a few years ago with a dismal cancer, and he seemed to bear his troubles exemplary. But now this was the end of him. After having appeared in the ministry several years acceptably and considerable growth, the beginning of his disorder in mind seemed to proceed from a small cut on his ankle, which from the symptoms seemed to threaten the lock-jaw, so that he became much alarmed and so to lose his reason.
[marginal note] A barn burnt with the lightning a few days ago, one Zilly’s about two mile off full of grain and hay, and, as I remarked one burnt a few months ago near Haddonfield.
{1814-09}
1 of the Ninth Month our meeting some life, though many very drowsy. Meeting small.
2. At our select meeting. Very low and hard getting along at first. Very trying, but I was favored to wade through and came off with good satisfaction at last, strengthened with that that casts out fear. See Ezekiel 5th and 8, etc. Oh, what cause of thankfulness and humility and gratitude!
4th. Was First Day. At our meeting. Simon Gilum of Pennsylvania (Bucks County) was there and had lively, pertinent, acceptable service. Although things very low forepart, many very drowsy, yet through mercy something lively and savory and satisfactory at last. I believe most, if not all, had a sense of it. He that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock, etc. <note resp="transcr">Matthew 7:24</note>  , the way to have a religion that stands the storms.
[marginal note] had to hold up to view to satisfaction.
My wife and I stopped with Simon Gilum and his wife at Samuel Church’s and spent the afternoon with them very pleasantly, but, I fear, not so profitably as we did when there with Nathan Smith a few weeks ago.
The city of Philadelphia is said to be very healthy this fall, not visited with the pestilential fever, but are in great fear of being visited with the sword as Alexander and Washington federal cities lately have been with great destruction of houses and property – very great alarms and preparations for war. Heard of several very sudden deaths. One Born Hill in Philadelphia fell down in the street as he was going from Presbyterian meeting and died instantly; and a woman in Evesham, as well as usual in the evening and found and dead in her bed in the morning; and of an elderly man in the newspapers taken unwell at midnight, sent for the doctor, who, feeling his pulse, both of them died immediately in Orleans. People talk of these things, but how very little effect they have.
[marginal note] Dreadful confusion now in Philadelphia on account of the wars. Seems like to be trying times [in] divers ways; threatenings of scarcity of bread calls still after divers ways and manners.

8th of the Ninth Month, 1814. At our Monthly Meeting. A pretty, open, lively time. I came off without condemnation. Enoch Roberts of Pennsylvania passed meeting with G. Frinch’s daughter. This afternoon I heard that a man by the name of Hunter (of Trenton), a very noted lawyer, fell under lowness and discouragement of mind on account of his circumstance and debts, and, although it is said his father-in-law offered to pay his debts, he took up a resolution that he would never break his fast again and so persisted in his resolution and refused taking victuals sixteen days, they say, and then died. Two instances I remarked, some years ago, of the like: J. Hollinshead and J. Harvey, and two were a few years ago burnt to death drunk as they lay by the fire. One Finemore, an elderly man near Burlington, the other a young man but left a wife and several children but a few miles from Burlington. J. Harvey, the younger. See here the doleful effects of the want of true religion. But these are but a very few instances amongst thousands and millions innumerable. It is remarkable, of late we hear of sudden deaths every few days. A man in Evesham killed by his horses running away with his wagon and young woman drowned in Delaware River. The fireworks in the steam boat bursted and sunk the boat; the rest were relieved by a boat in sight. Although these sudden deaths demonstrate the necessity of being ready at a short warning or none at all, they seem to have but very little effect as to awakening people to a care, to prepare for them and seem only to serve for a piece of fresh news. Most but the drunkards and worldlings notice these accidents they are full
[marginal note] A young man and a woman, R. Heaton, children died with the flux out of one house.
[marginal note] Dry weather.
11 of the Ninth Month. First Day. Although I was very poorly, I set off to go to our meeting in hopes I should get better but I got but about half way and was forced to stop at a neighbor’s house until my wife and children came back from meeting. My complaint has been what some call the colere [cholera] morbus or severe lax and vomiting, so I remain very poorly with it several days. May we not, when we look back, conclude we are some of us as brands plucked out of the burning or as a bird escaped from the hands of the fowler when we consider the many snares temptations and dangers we have met with. Temptations (as John Rutty says in his diary) to the greatest of wickedness, temptations to drunkenness, whoredom, and worldly, earthly mindedness and all manner of wickedness, and now to behold the bewitched infatuated state of the poor drunkards who seem to have lost the power of delivering themselves. How they seem to be enchanted, how they saunter about the tavern stores and still houses where a dram is to be had. It seems out of their power to keep from these schools of Satan, and, oh, what sorrowful work it makes with the wives and children! Now this plentiful season for apples, even men of bright genus [genius] and extensive capacities and are the wretched worldlings in a much better state? A worldly spirit (says one) is the most unready for a dying hour. 
[marginal note] <italic>Every Man’s Monitor </italic>[by John Coltman], page 139:
oh death, how bitter is the thoughts of thee to them that are at ease in their possessions, and as William Penn says, woe unto them who have their hearts and minds in the earth, for when that is gone, their heaven goes with it.  Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. None can serve two masters or be heirs of two kingdoms, nor serve both God and Mammon <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:24</note>  . The heresy of all heresy is an earthly worldly mind says William Law. And what says the scripture? Oh earth, earth, hear, Oh, earth <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>  , etc. And as William Penn says, oh how are the hearts and minds and affections of great parts of the world entangled and bemired with their accommodations and conveniences, and as the prophet said, they worship the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:8</note>  . So there is need to bear in mind that charge of the prophet: beware lest your hearts deceive you and ye be drawn aside. 
[marginal note] after other gods
to worship them and serve them <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 11:16</note>  , etc. Earth is the place where many enjoy and yet lose happiness, see <italic>Everyman’s Monitor</italic>, page 139: as one said on his dying bed, Oh, this world, it is the merest cheat, and as Solomon said, vanity of vanities, all is vanity <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 1:2</note>  and vexation of spirit.
[marginal note] very hot weather.
[marginal note] stormy.
<pb id="A0011526_054"/>
16 of Ninth Month, 1814. A very rainy time. Heard of dismal times at Baltimore. The English with a great army, they say, had a bloody battle with our people and many killed on both sides this week.
See <italic>Everyman’s Monitor</italic>, page 195: as security bolsters men up in their brutal sensuality, so sensuality rocks them asleep in their carnal security. And page 139: there is no way to avoid a national dissolution but by a national reformation. If this be true, how necessary for America to attend to it now, when we are so threatened with dissolution and is really fallen on divers places. Many houses left desolate, destroyed, great and fair without inhabitant, like the land of Median [Midian] and tents of Cushan. As the prophet said, he saw them in an afflicted trembling state <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:7</note>  , and is it not so in divers places now in our land? And Oh, how outward are the minds of most thinking to bringing about a peace and reconciliation but by changing men and measures in civil society and never seem to look into themselves for the cause of the threatening dissolution, nor for the right way to bring about a recopilation which no doubt is by a national reformation like Nineveh, whose example was written for our instruction and can there possibly be any other safe way for us at this day?
[marginal note] Stormy weather and I very poorly.
When I was a little boy, I can remember an alarm of war, when I was an apprentice lad there was another alarm of war, and since I am married there was another, still greater and come still nearer to us, and now the 4 since my time louder and louder and nearer and nearer. And to think how soon one generation passes away, and as they great and small of the former wars are gone to dust, so in a few years all those in the present commotion and confusions must return to dust, quiet and still enough. [Pierre] Charron says one said, the whole world was not worth a man’s troubling himself much about. It will bear thinking of and searching.
14 of Ninth Month. Was our select meeting at Haddonfield, but I so poorly and weather stormy I did not get to it. I hear Richard Jordan had good acceptable service.
15. Our quarterly meeting. From some accounts I expected to have seen there several strangers, ministers of note, but was disappointed. Richard Jordan not there – unwell, I hear. The meeting forepart seemed low and poor; several young men appeared, and the waters seemed to raise a little. I thought of these words: these people do want a Fox, a Barclay and a Penn among them. But again, cease [ye] from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:22</note>  ? A man can receive nothing except it be given him from above <note resp="transcr">John 3:27</note>  , except He that can open or shut up and none can open. As Job said, He shuteth up a man and there can be no opening <note resp="transcr">Job 12:14</note>   and can open the heart as He did the heart of Lidia <note resp="transcr">Acts 14:16</note>   formerly. The afternoon meeting for discipline was pretty satisfactory to me.
A certain writer says (<italic>Everyman’s Monitor</italic>, page 192), if there be a heaven upon earth it is in the company of Godly men. But I think it is in the company and communion with God and Christ. It is that only which can make a prison as pleasant as a palace and caused Paul and Silas to sing in the stocks. The meeting was large; it is wonderful to see the vast increase of numbers and of the advancement in outward conveniences – roads filled with carriages for miles together, and with what alacrity they seem to run and gather! But I was thinking whither George Fox and many others of our first worthies who labored so greatly to propagate this principle we profess, traveling through this our land when it was a vast howling wilderness in danger of being (as tis said of being) devoured by the wild beast and at that time possessed what they professed – even the favor protection and blessing of preservation, the one thing needful – whither or no after all this great labor bestowed upon us and the vast outward increase and improvements, they could sit down easy with us and own us, and whither or no we in our present state after all do as they did, that is, possess what we profess and are building upon the same foundation the rock of ages against which the gates of hell never did or ever shall prevail.
See the words of Philip Doddridge, <italic>Everyman’s Monitor</italic>, page 258: pressing and urging a home, family, religion, and care of children, without which it is to be feared your care of them in other respects will turn to very little account. For what is prosperity in life without the knowledge and fear and love of God? What but the poison of the soul, which swells and kills it? What but the means of making it more certainty, more deeply, more intolerably, more miserable when all its transient and empty amusements are passed away like a dream when one awaketh? Psalms 73:20.
<pb id="A0011526_055"/>
18th of the 9th Month, 1814. First Day. At our meeting. Samuel Scofield of Pennsylvania was there and said a little. The meeting very poor and very low, I thought. Very great alarms of war. The English landed an army nearer Baltimore, where they were met by the Americans and driven back to their vessels. Accounts differ respecting the number killed, but they say several hundred on each side. It caused great alarm in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, drawing out the militia and raising and listing and drafting men to prevent their coming to Philadelphia. Some, I hear, are gone to prison rather than go to war, some leave their wives and little children to go and some young friends’ children of the fore rank in our society so that what some of late have told us has come to pass on some viz. that the prison doors would be opened and the foundations tried of many, etc. 
22. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Very small waters, very low, 
[marginal note] Not much satisfaction 
yet there was some stirrings of life at last in divers and pertinent hints dropped. Now we may again say with the prophet, a sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 50:22</note>  . We heard again the sound of drum whilst we were in meeting. Moorestown again full of soldiers gathering together, preparing for war: poor drunkards leaving their poor wives and children, their sorrowful wives with their little children standing to see their husbands march off, many young lads, silly, giddy, unguarded, unthinking youths and other amongst them, and some youngish women seemed to be of their company. Other grievous effects of war, which true religion and true humility would utterly put an end to and prevent nation lifting up sword against nation.
[marginal note] Much rainy weather.
23 and 24. Seeding, sowing rye and getting in potatoes, etc.
25. First Day. At our meeting. An open, owning, strengthening, satisfactory time. Oh, what a mercy yet at times continued to us, a poor, trifling people. As to religion, very few, if any, enough in earnest as the nature of the case requires, and the times loudly calls for in the signs of the times. About sowing rye and getting in potatoes, etc.
[marginal note] Wet weather, thunder, showers.
29. Fifth Day. Our meeting small, but not the poorest to me; owning and uniting. But alas, how great a thing it is to keep right when we are so. It is for want of watchfulness, humility and the right sort of fear. Oh, that there were such a heart in them to fear me always and keep all my commandments that it might be well with them and their children forever <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 5:29</note>  . Oh, this sea of glass mingled with fire <note resp="transcr">Revelation 15:2</note>  ! And as William Penn says, we are like soldiers in battle, always in danger of shot or being wounded. Pride goes before a fall and how great a thing it is to keep clear of pride and in true humility, where is safety only.
See Charron, page 86: a man must take care not to express such an eagerness after these things as is inconsistent with the things themselves, not to be exalted and puffed up with vain opinions of one’s self every time he does well. For he that does thus procures his own dishonor and, while he strives with great pains to lift his head above the crowd, discovers his nakedness and shame at the same time. Oh, says [Isaac] Watts, how prone I am to make idols of blessing bestowed upon me, either temporal or spiritual, and again Isidore says pride is as apt to grow upon our virtues as our vice; and he that grows better, let him beware lest he grow proud and vain glory, give him a greater overthrow than his former vices. May I improve on these lessons.
{1814-10}
[marginal note] Joseph Evans of Evesham had his arm cut with an ax so that I hear the doctor thinks he will not recover. Divers were at play with the ax, throwing it, and it struck him and almost cut his arm off, and three women now have cancers in the breast.
1814 – 2nd of the Tenth Month. First Day. My daughter Hannah went with me to Evesham meeting, although I was ready to say with some of old, my wounds stink because of my foolishness <note resp="transcr">Psalm 38:5</note>   and another says, woe is me because I am a man of unclean lips <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 6:5</note>  , etc. Yet through mercy it was an open, owning, strengthening time, I believe to general satisfaction. May the goodness of the Lord lead us to repentance and amendment of life, who is yet long suffering, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.
<pb id="A0011526_056"/>
6 of the Tenth Month, 1814. Was our Monthly Meeting. A lively time this is, doing of business, as Thomas Ross said on the like occasion. The dullness over, many getting in potatoes and buckwheat, etc.
9. Was First Day. My daughter Hannah went with me to Westfield meeting, which was as owning, open a time as is usual for me to see. I had sent word by a friend of that meeting that I should be willing to see the people together who do not profess with us and divers of them were there who seem very pleasant and respectful after meeting, although I went against wind and tide as I may say divers times gave out. A few leaves back, I remarked in the writings of Charron of one who said that all the world is not worth a man’s giving himself much trouble or very great anxiety about it, and it seems to me it will be on examining. Solomon said at last, vanity of vanities, all is vanity <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 1:2</note>   and vexation of spirit, because the time of enjoying all these worldly comforts is so short. Martha, Martha, thou are careful about many things, one thing is needful <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:41-42</note>  . Very suddenly are many taken away, and then what is this one thing needful (this has been the language of some in my hearing)?
[marginal note] Dry warm weather getting in buckwheat, etc.
Fletcher: ten thousand worlds would I give if I had it in my power for peace with my maker. Ten thousand worlds, one upon the back of another, would not tempt me to live in this world as I have done, said Dennis Getchell. What would all the world avail me now, or ten thousands of worlds, if I had not this peace of mind which I feel to support me now, said William Hunt. What would I give for all this world now I am just going to leave it? Why, nothing at all, said P. Brown, <italic>Piety Promoted</italic>. See [Ambrose Searle’s] <italic>Christian Remembrancer</italic>, page 169: the very foresight of the joys of Heaven throws into content all the poor affairs of this world, etc. But Oh, what shall the possession do? Oh, that I had the opportunity of presenting unto the Lord one year of such a devoted and religious life as I never yet before now intended, said penitence under the character of repentance, no doubt the case of many when too late. I ask not for years but a few days, although a whole age were too little for the great work I have to do, said the wretched Altamont. See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Power of Religion on the Mind</italic>. No doubt the case of many poor creatures. The language to the man we read of whose ground brought forth plentifully and concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years and he would eat, drink and be merry or take his rest, was thou fool this night, shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:16-20</note>  ? And again we read that as a partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and in the end become a fool <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 17:11</note>  . See [Thomas] Bromley’s <italic>Works</italic>, The <italic>Way to the Sabbath of Rest</italic>, page 20: the world and the primary chain that hinders the soul’s gradual assent towards God. And we may find there is something in every one which is the (w) [illegible] souls Delilah that shaves its locks and betrays its strength etc. (w) [illegible] see Hebrews 12: 1st verse, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, etc.
[marginal note] Fine, dry, very warm weather.
13. Tenth Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Enoch Roberts of Philadelphia and Rachael Frinch were married. I hardly know what was the matter; without, it was a want and keeping humble enough. After several favored meetings of late, I had not much satisfaction nor felt much condemnation, although there was not that savor as I could wish - the pomegranate as well as the bell <note resp="transcr">Exodus 28:34</note>  . The young people behaved sober and well, although too much conformity to the world’s fashions and ways. Yet I thought it ended pretty savory and well.
14. Went to Cropwell to meet John Cox and his companion, our cousin Samuel Wills. The meeting was very small – occasioned in part by much sickness – and very poor and low and destitute of life, so much so that I dare not venture. But John Cox had considerable to say at last, lively and acceptable. We dined with them at Hannah Lippincott’s and her sister’s and had a little sitting for the better I hope. Then we went to see Thomas Homes and wife, had a sitting with them to my satisfaction. The man having low in mind years past. Heard of the death of two young men in that neighborhood – died with a fever - and heard of the death of Claton Brown’s wife, died much deranged, refused to eat.
<pb id="A0011526_057"/>
15 of the Tenth Month, 1814. On Seventh Day. Our dear and worthy friend, John Cox, and his companion, our cousin, Samuel Wills, my wife’s sister son, Rachel’s son, came to see us and Hinchman Haines and wife and, a satisfactory visit I believe it was to us all, in a solid pause at parting. Hinchman Haines is become an able minister, just going off to New England again. John Cox is minister now; in our day, quite amongst the first class in good esteem.
[marginal note] A little rain.
16 was First Day. At our meeting. John Cox had very acceptable service and it was an open, satisfactory time to me, owning, strengthening and uniting, and it ended savory and well. All seemed pleasant and sweet, open and near after it broke up. Oh, what a favor and that we could so live and conduct as to have it continued and increase!
[marginal note] Fine weather.
See Charron’s work, page 444, on the nature and necessity of public government, and though its rising to a just height is gradual and slow, a work of much time and great pains and prudence, yet the ruins and decays of it are frequently sudden and surprising, and the constitutions which took up ages to finish and build up are broken and thrown down in a moment. But can this be the case with a constitution of true Christians, founded on the true Christian religion, which exceeds all the laws and discipline that ever men could invent for their safety and happiness, both present and future? Oh, the party spirits, divisions, contentions and confusions now in our land about politics and the form of government, which the law written in the heart, the law of the spirit of life, if attended to, would put an end to and bring all into right order! And can anything else do it? Husking corn, etc.
20. Fifth Day. At our meeting. A satisfactory time it was to me, although very close, plain dealing on that of a selfish spirit amongst us. Joseph Justice was there and appeared in prayer.
21 and 22. Getting in our corn stalks, apples, etc.
23. First Day. At our meeting, shut up silent to me. Ann Edwards appeared, but I thought it a low time.
About our corn, finishing some sowing rye, etc.
[marginal note] A long spell of dry weather, but now a great storm.
27. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Though small, a lively, owning, open, satisfactory time to me, uniting and strengthening. Hauling in corn, etc.
Seventh Day 29. I set off over into Pennsylvania with Ebenezer Roberts and John Matlack. We got to our dear kind old friend William Blakey’s to dinner and he went with us to see Samuel Cowperthwaite (about 6 miles), who had lately brought an acknowledgment to our Monthly Meeting for outgoing in his marriage, and we had an open, satisfactory opportunity with him and his wife and Brother Joseph. Parted with them sweet and pleasant and got back to William Blakey’s to lodge with him and his kind, motherly wife. We were very sweetly and kindly entertained.
30 was First Day. We went to their meeting at Middletown, which was large, and I believe there are a valuable number of choice friends there. But they are very rich and abound in great plenty, and it seemed to me a spirit of ease too much prevails, and the waters seemed low and a want of life and power. Hardish getting along, though somewhat owning, and came off middling at last. Friends were very kind and inviting after meeting, and we parted with feeling nearness. Dined at Steven Comforts, choice friends. He set us on our way and we got well home and found all well and had no cause to repent going, a pleasant journey.
{1814-11}
<note resp="transcr">Note on inside front cover of the journal: Our grandson David Hunt here 1 of the Eleventh Month, 1814.</note> 
3. At our meeting and a precious, owning, lively one it was to me, strengthening. Our son Joseph and wife and son David came to see us and was at meeting. He is grown so fat I did not know him at first, he is so altered.
6. First Day. My wife and son Joseph and his wife went to Ancocas meeting which we did think was a good, satisfactory, open, owning time. Dined at our cousin Samuel Wills and then went to our cousin Joseph Wills to lodge, where our sister Hannah Buzby lives. Had a religious opportunity in the evening.
7. Came homeward, called to see our old neighbor, Samuel White, and then to Darling Conrow’s to dine and see our dear little grand children, then got well home and a satisfactory visit it was all. Seemed to end well.
8 of Eleventh Month. Our son Joseph and wife and son David set off homeward.
8th and 9th. About home. Finished getting in corn stalks, etc.
[marginal note] Rainy, stormy, very rainy several days. Clears up fine and moderate.
<pb id="A0011526_058"/>
10th of the Eleventh Month. At our Monthly Meeting. Deborah Stewart of Haddonfield was there and had savory acceptable service, although I thought the waters were low in meeting for business. We had some conference on the subject of our young people passing meeting and accomplishing marriages and my zeal was kindled against some customs rather more than some could well bear, for I believe the cause of truth suffers amongst us on these occasions, although we get along very smooth. My dear cousin William Hunt (who Richard Jordan a few weeks ago told our son Benjamin that William Hunt was the greatest man that ever Carolina held) used to say most of his work was rough, but said he to me, rough work brings good pay if it is well done. But I fear mine wanted more of the pomegranate and I had not satisfaction. Oh, the need of keeping in thee humility!
13. First Day. Deborah Stewart was there and had very pertinent acceptable service.
14 about home and 15 was at a neighbor’s house, J. Hans where was a number of very gay, light, airy young women. I had a sitting with them, I hope for the better. Oh, how are our young women carried away with the foolish fashions, with their arms naked as to their shoulders and hair curled over their foreheads and such thin dresses in winter that our doctors think many shorten their days thereby!
16. Went with my daughter Abigail to see Jeremiah Matlack and his wife. She has kept her bed chiefly four years and now very weak and low. Phoebe Roberts and my daughter Abigail being appointed by our Women’s meeting to take and read their epistle and extracts to such who cannot get out to meeting, which were read to them. Very excellent advice, after which I had some further remarks with all, which they expressed satisfaction and seemed to take the visit very kind.
[marginal note] A man shot accidentally near toll bridge left a wife and four children, and one shot down the river by accident hunting ducks.
17. At our meeting. Small and things as to the life and power very low, yet I came off middling well satisfied, though not that life I could desire.
18 and 19. About home, about divers little matters. Favored with better health than years past.
20. First Day. At our meeting, a very poor, low time, indolence. This afternoon, Leticia Ware and her companion, Oakford, from Derby appointed a meeting at our meeting and they had good acceptable service and I and others thought it was a good, solid, profitable meeting and pretty large.
20-22: Our son Benjamin’s wife very ill, lain now about a week. Got better.
24. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting, pretty lively with some.
25 and 28. About home, nothing material.
[marginal note] A cold great rain.
27. First Day. At our meeting. A very cold great storm of rain, yet it was not a very small meeting and a precious owning time I believe it was. Stand ye idle in the market place, etc., etc., etc., illustrated. Was at our meetings both weekdays and First Days as they came in course. Look in the glass of righteousness that tells true, said William Penn.
{1814-12}
Twelfth Month 4. First Day. The superior excellency of the Christian religion, what it is, a communion with our maker, the most exalted, dignified state, etc., etc.
6. First snow clears away calm and moderate. See Henry Tuke on <italic>The Principles of Religion</italic>, page 65, on silent worship when mercifully favored with divine influence upon the soul constitutes the highest enjoyment of man upon earth.
7. Killing some of our hogs, etc.
8. Our Monthly Meeting pretty lively and satisfactory to some, I believe. <note resp="transcr">Chester Monthly Meeting minutes, December 1814: “A Certificate of Removal was produced on behalf Samuel Church and Rachel his Wife with their four minor children (namely) Abraham Matlack, Rebecca, Sarah, and Antrim, from Middletown Monthly Meeting in Pennsylvania dated the 10th of last month which being read was received and Silas Walton and John Hunt appointed to pay them a visit.”</note> 
9 and 10. About home. Cold, freezing: went to Walton’s Mill this evening. As large a snow fell as is common to have.
11. First Day. We waded through the snow to our meeting, and an owning, strengthening time it was to me – very unexpectedly, for I felt like shutting up and laying by.
12 and 13. A great snow and freezing cold.
14. At our select quarterly meeting. Comfortable though silent, with Richard Jordan only him and me in the gallery. Remember the rock from whence ye were hewn, etc. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 51:1</note>   was my lesson.
<pb id="A0011526_059"/>
15 of the Twelfth Month, 1814. Was our quarterly meeting. Very large and a precious, highly favored time it was. Richard Jordan was clothed and raised in great eminence - large, pertinent, and powerful in testimony and several others savory, and it ended solid, weighty, and savory, I believe, to all. A strengthening time to many, no doubt.
[marginal note] Grows warmer.
18. First Day. At our meeting. Joseph Justice had acceptable service and it ended pretty well; though silent as to me, yet not without matter. See Thomas Hartley’s works bound with [Thomas] Bromley, page 8, on the subject of mistakes on religion setting forth the state of religion time past both in adversity and prosperity: that we may not grow remiss by our advantages and so become losers by that which was intended for our benefits.  Has not this been the case with religious professors as he there shews, that the purest ages and most highly favored with heavenly goodness were in the times of greatest persecution, and whenever they were favored and tried with wealth and prosperity they lost the life, power, and spirit of true religion? And see page 47 of Hartley’s works, speaking of that high state of Christian perfection in which men of purified souls hold intimate communion with God through the fellowship of his Holy Spirit and so on sitting forth the greatness of that blessed high attainment. Of such high experience at last he quotes one Dr. More’s words, who calls it a most joyous state of mind – a union with the divine celestial principle – a state of glorious liberty. An inhabitant of Heaven, he that is come hither, God hath taken him to be his own familiar friend, and though he speaks to others aloof of in outward religions and parable, yet he leads this man by the hand, speaks to him plainly in his own language, sweetly insinuates himself into and possesses all his faculties, understanding, reason, and memory. This is the darling of God and a prince amongst men, far above the dispensation of either miracles of prophecy.
Oh, how have many, many, very many, of us, indeed, been pursuing lying vanities and forsaking our own mercies, seeing we are endowed with capacities and gifts and means to attain to such a blessed and happy enjoyments here on earth! Again, see Hartley, page 67: it is very certain that the greatest part in every age and place have stopped short of the truth and substance by resting in the outside of things and therefore St. Paul, that great preacher of of inward and spiritual religion, takes much pains both with Jew and Gentile to convince them of their gross ignorance and error, etc., etc., in this particular.
And see page 59, where he ascribes or describes the operations of the spirit of God in Holy souls: at certain times they are elated as at a royal banquet and rejoice with gladness and joy unspeakable; at other times, as the angels light and agile and, as it were, free from all encumbrance of these material vehicles; and at other times, like men overcome with drink, exhilarated and even intoxicated with the spirit; at other season they are sunk into grief and lamentation for all mankind, interceding for the whole stock of Adam and taking up a wailing and weeping for it. Then again so inflamed with the joy and love of the spirit that, if it were possible, they would snatch up every man into their bosom. Sometimes they are humbled so far below every other person in self abasement that they think themselves inferior to and less than all; at others they resemble a strong man who comes forth in royal armour to the battle and valiantly overcomes his enemies, etc. So very various is the ways of the spirit in conducting the soul to God – sometimes refreshing her and sometimes trying and exercising her, that so she may be presented pure and perfect to our Heavenly Father.
I have thought I have felt these ups and downs – as David says, by thee have I run through a troop, etc. <note resp="transcr">Psalm 18:29</note>   – and at other times feel as if I could not go at all any further. At some times feel, as Thomas Scattergood said, as if I could run from one end of the continent to the other, etc.

1814. 22nd of the Twelfth Month. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting, shut up and poor.
Seventh day. 24th. Killing some more of our hogs, pretty moderate weather. This evening George Roberts took me up to Joshua Stokes’s.
25. First Day. Joshua Stokes and wife and G.R. went with me to Vincentown meeting. Although I have been thinking of going there some months past, yet when way opened for going I seemed all shut up, undone, unfit, poor, and naked that I was ready to abhor myself and so it continued to be till I got to meeting, so that I seemed willing the meeting should be very small, which seemed like to be the case a while at first; but they came in until it was as large as is usual at that place and after a while growd better and an owning time, favored and strengthening, so that at last I should have been willing all the people of the town and neighborhood had been there. Very open, free, pleasant, kind, and inviting they were after meeting. We came to Joshua Stokes’s to dine and then got well home. Oh, what a subtle enemy we have, always endeavouring to destroy and lay waste all good!
Fifth Day. At our meeting to pretty good satisfaction. After meeting, Silas Walton and wife and sister Esther Collins and I visited Samuel Church’s family, being nominated at our Monthly Meeting so to do. they having lately brought a certificate from Pennsylvania to satisfaction. About home chiefly, nothing material except fine weather inward and outward.
[marginal note] Weather very fine and moderate.
{1815-01}
1 of the First Month. First Day, 1815. At our meeting, which seemed low and trying at first but ended very well, a favored, open, owning time. Oh, how open, sweet, near and pleasant all seemed when we came out of meeting! If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light, etc. <note resp="transcr">Luke 11:34</note>  , etc. Heard of the death of William Buzby, who served his apprenticeship with me. Died very suddenly with the bilious colic, And a friend told me that he had seen an account in the news that the spotted fever was in a certain town in New England, so mortal that it was as bad as the plague in Constantinople almost, whole families were swept away by it.
[marginal note] Warm, like spring weather.
Second Day. I went to Mill at Haddonfield and several other little errands. Went to see Eliza Bispham, young woman who has lain three years in a very lingering, declining state of health and now very weak, poor and low so that she can hardly talk any. Then went to see my old school mate Sarah Gill, about eighty, and then to see our worthy friend Deborah Stuart, all to satisfaction.
[marginal note] Fourth Day. Rain clears up with snow and cold.
5th. Was our Monthly Meeting. We had several strangers: Joseph Justice, John Letchworth, Elizabeth Coleman - and lively, famous, favored time some of us thought it was. David Roberts and one Austin passed meeting, D.R. with Rachel Hunt, the other with J. Dudley’s daughter. Our sister, Hannah Buzby, and Lidia Lippincott came here and lodged. <note resp="transcr">Chester Monthly Meeting minutes, January 1815: “David Roberts son of Joseph Roberts and Rachel Hunt daughter of Jon Hunt appeared and declared their intentions of marriage with each other. Surviving parents being present expressed consent, George Matlack and Darling Haines were appointed to inquire into his [attachments</note> of the like engagements with others and report to next meeting”] 
[marginal note] Very cold. Snow on the ground.
8. First Day. At our meeting. Not that savor, life, and satisfaction as at some other times, nor feeling nearness after meeting.
[marginal note] Warm.
11. Killing and dressing a beef, etc.
12. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Right lively, open, and savory. A pleasant feeling [of] nearness after, to good satisfaction the looks like going to work: an instructing lesson to me.
[marginal note] Cold again.
15. First Day. At our meeting. Sarah Cresson of Haddonfield and had sweet, pertinent, acceptable service, and it was an owning, open time to me, a favored, precious time. Most there, I believe, had a sense of [indecipherable], though many know not what it is or how to set a price upon it.
19. Fifth Day. I was at Evesham meeting, very satisfactory and open. On this subject it is a fine thing to have the Lord for our friend etc., etc.
<pb id="A0011526_061"/>
22 of the First Month. First Day. At our meeting. It seemed like low water and hard getting along, yet came off middling, though not that life and savor as some other times. It was a most violent snowy, stormy day, the largest snow of any yet this winter. Wind very high and snowed so fast it looked dismal. Could see but a little ways through it. I was afraid some would perish in this storm.
[marginal note] Clear up moderate.
I have read first volume of [Thomas] Clarkson’s writings on the abolition of the slave trade containing 455 pages, in about four days, and it was very affecting to see the accounts of the grievous sufferings and destruction and misery of the many thousands of the poor black people and also the grievous destruction and misery of great numbers of seamen in bringing them from Africa. From the year 1640 to the year 1787, I think, Anthony Benezet and John Woolman, page 314 and 318, says one hundred thousand yearly has been brought away. And then to see and think how the lord raised up instruments in every nation and amongst almost every religious society of people and their great and united labor to put a stop to this most grievous, wicked traffic in slaves and what great opposition they met with and how they were carried through all until they obtained their end, the abolition of the slave trade, an evil of the deepest dye amongst mankind and of long continuance. It might serve to shew what great things may be done in bringing about a reformation and removing the greatest of evils and long and deep rooted vain customs, when and where men are faithful and united. Then, as we read, they might say to this mountain, be thou plucked up and planted in the sea and it should obey you.
See George Fox’s <italic>Journal</italic>, page 309: therefore let none murmur nor distrust God, for he will provoke many to zeal against unrighteousness and for righteousness, through things that are now suffered to work for a season. Yea, many whose zeal have been dead shall revive again and they shall see their backslidings and bewail them bitterly; for God shall thunder from heaven and break forth in a mighty noise. His enemies shall be astonished, the workers of iniquity, confounded; and all that have not on the garment of righteousness shall be amazed at the mighty and strange work of the Lord, which shall certainly be brought to pass. The Lord will provoke many to zeal against unrighteousness, etc. See, hath it not been so from the beginning, ever since the days of Noah, who was a preacher of righteousness? And David said, the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up <note resp="transcr">Psalm 69:9</note>  . And Phinehas – zeal, as we read, was accounted unto him for righteousness when he slew them caught in adultery <note resp="transcr">Psalm 106:29-31</note>  . And Cyrus, whom the Lord calls his shepherd, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 45:1</note>   and so down to these days. Many, many, many, indeed, have been raised up with great zeal against unrighteousness, as many be seen in the accounts of the progressive steps. Oh, the great work of the reformation in divers ages and nations! As John Wycliffe, who was called the morning star of the reformation, George Fox, and great numbers of others too tedious to mention – some for one part of the business and some for another. Thomas Clarkson and many others to labor for the melioration of the poor, grievously injured, suffering Africans; John Howard  for the poor sufferers in nasty prisons. Oh, how zealous they were in their labors giving up all time and talent, and hazarding their lives in their labors through great perils and dangers – as Paul says, perils by land, perils by sea, and in the wilderness, and above all amongst false brethren <note resp="transcr">2 Corinthians 11:26</note>   – but were preserved through all by the Lords preserving power, who fitted, qualified, and raised them up for his service! Joseph Wills and wife and Hannah Buzby here to see us. Great snow and very cold.
[marginal note] very cold freezing.
<pb id="A0011526_062"/>
26 of the First Month, 1815. At our preparative meeting. A great snow and very cold. It, I thought, a poor, low, mortifying time to me. No salt, no savor or life. Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the white of an egg <note resp="transcr">Job 6:6</note>  ? Have salt in yourselves; every sacrifice must be seasoned with salt and salted with fire: the bell and the pomegranate together <note resp="transcr">Exodus 28:34</note>  . A sickening time to me, although several meetings of late I have felt like running through a troop and leaping over the walls of opposition <note resp="transcr">Psalm 18:29</note>   and something like what John Rutty mentions, a song in the night soliloquy, etc. But these ups and downs are no new thing; the prophets speak of such things, both Isaiah and David. Woe is me, I am undone <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 6:5</note>  ; my wounds stink because of my foolishness etc. <note resp="transcr">Psalm 38:5</note>  . I have seen it so in the very foremost. Could not preach nor let it alone. Mortifying times, but let me not palliate or daub myself.
[marginal note] Very cold, a great snow. Good sleighing, great flying about in sixty dollar sleighs. One says his lost and one not kind; most in profession.
29. First Day. At our meeting. Self pretty much down, I hope. Came off pretty well satisfied. There is but one thing and but one that is worthy of much of our anxiety, concern, and care or pursuit etc. It cannot be gotten for gold; neither shall gold or silver be weighed for the price thereof; all this world can afford cannot give it. An instructing, comforting lesson to me illustrated.
[marginal note] Extreme cold.
31. Extreme cold, freezing, severe, cold as we ever knew. It seemed dangerous to be out and to me; it looked awful to see how the creatures trembled with the cold and how they shrinked up. And how many of the poor must suffer, who have but poor cold houses scant of provision and of victuals and clothes, by night and by day and pinched very much for firewood. Oh, how many poor women must suffer (and their children) who have drunken, careless, lazy husband! And it’s likely many of the rabbits, squirrels and partridges and, etc., will perish, as I suppose they often do in such hard weather. I have been told that the Indians used formerly to say when they had such hard cold winters they thought the Great Spirit was angry with them. So it seem clear they believed there was an all powerful being that superintended the universe and presided over the seasons of heat and of cold and of plenty and of scarcity of health and of sickness, etc.
[marginal note] Weather some more moderated.
{1815-02}
4 of the Second Month 1815. We went to the burial of Joshua Roberts, between forty and fifty, a stout, healthy man. Left a wife and family of children. Last Fifth Day, very cold, he was at our preparative meeting and was our clerk. We had an unusual deal of business respecting our schools, appointing committees to attend them, care of meeting house lots, funds about building more stables or sheds, etc., etc. Several of us thought we never seen him act more lively and with more propriety. He was taken with a chill latter part of the meeting. He got home and his illness increased so rapidly that he seemed not sensible till he died, which was about three days. Illness with what the doctors call a typhus fever or typhus quinsy. Divers others have been suddenly taken away in like manner, suddenly deprived of their reason. I had some satisfaction at the house, although the solemn call seemed to make too little impressions on the minds of the people. Joseph Justice there.
Fifth Day. Found one of our horses dead this morning. It has been ailing and lingering several months and pretty old. It prevented my getting [to] meeting. Also at this time, we heard of the death of Caleb Crispin of Evesham, about fifty. He has been in a lingering poorly way a considerable time past, although a stout man a few years ago. So we see it is as formerly; one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet; another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure tedious days and wearisome nights appointed unto them, as Job says <note resp="transcr">Job 7:3</note>  .
First Day. At our meeting. Something owning to good satisfaction and strengthening.
Second Day. Went on business to our son John’s. Heard of the death of Esther Troth, about 76 perhaps, and that she was burnt to death. Fell into the fire and there burned till they discovered a very unusual smell. She once lived in the family where I was an apprentice. It is appointed for all once to die, but the time when, the place where and the manner how is a secret. But one way to come into the world but many ways to go out of it. We come into the world naked and bare, go through it with trouble and care, go out of it nobody knows where, but if we do well here, farewell there <note resp="transcr">“We came into the world…” attributed to John Edwin (1749-1790)</note>  .
<pb id="A0011526_063"/>
9th of the Second Month, 1815. At our Monthly Meeting. I think our Monthly Meetings are mostly favored and lively, though yet room for great improvement in solidity and weightiness.
10. I went to our neighbor C. Frinch’s to mend his pump. The children read some account in the news that the typhus fever prevails to an alarming degree in the District of Columbia, and from the Portsmouth papers, N.H. Oracle of December 31, this typhus or spotted fever rages greatly. They say those who are most liable to it are those who fatigue themselves by too frequent, and assiduous watching with the sick, the intemperate or drunkards, and who violently expose themselves or exert themselves carelessly to the weather, the young and infirm females who go too thinly clothed and (wear as that doctor expresses himself) wear cobweb shoes and stockings. In an account some time or years back, the doctors say this sickness fell very much on the young women, owing to their going in such thin dresses, their silks and their arms bare almost up to their shoulders. This typhus, epidemical malignant fever, attacks them in various ways but makes a rapid progress and takes them away they say sometimes in three, six, nine or twelve hours. Richmond, Virginia also inform that this contagious distemper rages there; (they say) the distemper is distressing beyond anything that you can imagine. It takes of whole families; the nearest relations are afraid to go to see one another. If the disease does not abate I am apprehensive it will destroy the greatest part of our inhabitants.
In King George, there was a family of ten, the whole dead except a little boy, who went to a neighbor’s house after starving a day or two and asked for some bread. The neighbor asked him if he had not a plenty of bread at home. He said his father and mother and the rest of the family were asleep and that he could not wake them. He was asked how long they had been asleep. He said a day or two. The neighbors went over and found nine of them dead. They were so much alarmed they concluded to set fire to the house and burn them up, which was done. The coffin maker has made thirteen coffins in eight or ten days. This alarming disease has raged in divers places and made great ravages or destruction – it frequently kills in from six to twelve hours (and some say in three hours instances have been known). It principally preys upon the heartiest and most robust patients. The physicians are at a loss to describe or treat it; some describe it as a typhus fever, others as a violent, inflammatory sore throat. It affects the throat most violently and obstructs the circulation of the air through the windpipe. 
[marginal note] Our neighbor Joshua Robert, his throat was very much affected, and several others who have died near Moorestown.
In a few instances, as in the one above stated, the houses in which the dead have laid have been burnt down to prevent the diffusion of the contagion. They say six burials met together at one time in one graveyard.
In some in some instances whole families are destroyed, see my account in 1812, 7 of the Sixth Month in New England. They are frequently struck with a perfect lethargy and loss of senses, sometimes only with acute local pain. But in most cases, the process of death, however the patient is assailed, is tremendously rapid and has prevailed in an alarming degree in Virginia. The Fall William Rogers and I went to Ohio; they died so that, they said, that their graveyard looked like a new plowed field and that there was not enough in health to nurse the sick or bury the dead, and were forced to stop travelers to help them. Not able to hand one another a cup of drink, not able to get in their harvest or put in their seed corn. Offered a dollar a night to one to help take care of them, and horses, plow, and seed corn to anyone that would put in their grain to the halves.
<pb id="A0011526_064"/>
12th of the Second Month, 1815. First Day. At our meeting. Rather smaller than common, and that not the worst of it. Very poor and low and quite silent, but I was fully of the mind that I missed it in being too backward afraid of myself when meeting broke up and came away in debt to some, and it cannot ever be recalled that I can see, for it’s not likely I shall ever have the like opportunity with the same company together, or the like opening.
We had had several weeks of very cold, severe, freezing weather and much snow. No rain several weeks.
16. Fifth Day. At our meeting. David Roberts and our cousin Rachel Hunt were married; an open, favored, strengthening time.
About this time a very great noise about + on account of peace being proclaimed, illuminating houses, villages and towns. Great indeed, was the folly of the people running into great excess, driving away to Philadelphia to see the illumination and rejoicing – the very children crying out in their beds, peace and plenty, etc., repeating it.
But I fear the rejoicing of many of them will be very short. 24 of the Sixth Month, 1812, I remarked that our rulers proclaimed war with England and marched off 1500 thousand [six] men to New York. A few years ago it was said that all nations were at war that we have any account of, and now in Europe all (it is said) have made peace after abundance of bloodshed and many died with hardships and sickness. Very lately, it is said, a dreadful battle at Orleans or Luseann [Louisiana] and several thousands slain and many taken prisoners.
19. First Day. At our meeting which at first I thought very poor, low, and trying, but it growed better and ended pretty lively, as J.C. seemed to think. A great want of individual labor, but few to work brings the labor hard on a few. See George Fox’s <italic>Journal</italic>, page 638: for talking of victuals and clothes doth not clothe the body nor feed it. No more are their souls and spirits fed and clothed except they have the bread and water of life to feed them and the righteousness of Christ to clothe them. Talking of outward things and spiritual things and not possessing them may starve both their bodies and their souls. Therefore quench not the spirit of God which will lead to be diligent in all things. See page do. 641. I have lately printed the life of William Caton but have not made a collection of his books.
23 of the Second Month, 1815. We went to the burial of our little granddaughter Martha Hunt, our son Benjamin’s daughter, about six years and eight months old. Lay ill about three weeks and suffered very much with a violent fever, sore throat and, they say, a dropsy in the head. A very cold and dreadful snowy day. Many are afflicted now a days with disorders, the doctors hardly know what to call them or how to treat them. Some, they say, after laying ill several weeks have recovered and lost their hearing and their senses. Oh, how many awful calls to be in readiness and how little effect they have! Death at distance we but slightly fear; he brings his terror as he draws more near, except it be to them who are prepared. These have had to that: death is not the king of terrors to them. Humphrey Smith said, just at last it is a fine thing for a man to have the Lord for his friend at last; to have the answer of <italic>well done, good and faithful servant</italic> at last is the crown of all and the greatest blessing ever conferred on man. What is it that constitutes the highest enjoyment of man on Earth, the highest source of happiness? See [J.P. Brissot de Warville’s]<italic> A Critical Examination of the Marquis De Chatelleux</italic>, page 32. What is that which William Penn says is the supreme act of man’s life? Is it not spiritual worship? What is it our Friends in a late epistle calls the supreme excellency of the Christian religion? Why, an acquaintance and communion with our maker, and Seneca, I think, says this is the highest pitch of Christian perfection. Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any hear and will open unto me I will come in and sup with him and he with me <note resp="transcr">Revelation 3:20</note> . Is not this the highest honor and greatest riches? Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 58:14</note>  . As John Woolman says a joy and delight of all others the most pure. But how do many keep him out till his head is wet with the dew and his locks as with the drops of the night <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 5:2</note>  !
[marginal note] 25. A violent snow storm again.
<pb id="A0011526_065"/>
27 of the Second Month 1815. Was our preparative meeting. Joshua Austin and Priscilla Dudley were married, and old Rebeckah Lippincott, near 81, was buried before meeting. I was too late getting there, which hurt me (weather cold, bad roads) through diffidence and fear. I fear I was not clear of all there; after meeting it seemed so to me, and so one misstep makes way for another, as it did formerly with the Israelites – when they should have went to battle they would not, and when they should not go to battle, then they would go and so were defeated. Some thought it a favored time, but it was a mortifying time to me (and wounding). So, as William Penn says, always in danger of shot. Oh, the need of continual watchfulness, humility, and that fear which keeps the heart clean and is a fountain of life and preserves from the snares of death. See [Robert] Barclay’s <italic>Apology</italic>, page 3, seeing the height of all happiness is placed in the true knowledge of God (this is life eternal, to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent), the true and right understanding of this foundation and ground of knowledge in that which is most necessary to be known and believed in the first place. And see [Robert] Barclay’s <italic>Apology</italic>, page 58: the horrible bloodshed about religion where with Europe hath been afflicted, and see same book, page 528: Friends’ cruel abuse for using the plain language.
27. First Day. At our meeting. A favored, strengthening, healing time to satisfaction. See Thomas à Kempis’ words, page 48: there is no true liberty, nor right gladness but in the fear of God and a good conscience. An excellent chapter, XVI, of compunction of heart. Very much snow has lain now about five weeks, frequent violent storms and severe cold freezing weather. The river so frozen up that they hall [hauled] wood over on the ice. Now a little more moderate.
28. The last of the Second Month. My daughter, Abigail, Josiah Roberts and wife and I went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting. John Cox had the chief part in the ministry; I thought a savor and solemnity attended. John Heald and his companion from Ohio were there, and there is a large number of choice Friends belonging to that quarter.
We have had about six weeks very severe winter freezing weather and very much snow. They have slid wood over the river on the ice several week together, but 1 of the Third Month grow warm and spring like, though the snow not quite gone.
{1815-03}
Fifth day of Third Month. My daughter Hannah and I went to Evesham Preparative meeting. Forepart some satisfaction; some seemed glad to see me and hear me, too, though I thought the waters very low. Especially afternoon, great weakness appeared in answering queries. Still after abundance of labor from many laborers.
3. At our select meeting better than common as to smooth getting along. This afternoon, I went a little bit to Joshua Robert’s vendue. Wanted to buy several things, but no satisfaction. Vendues is no place for me, I feel like a fool. Received a remarkable account in a little book <note resp="transcr">Frederick Smith, An account of a religious society in Norway, called Saints: with a few letters written by some of them. |c Also, some interesting particulars relating to several prisoners on board a Danish ship, who were convinced of the principles of Friends, from the year 1812 to 1814. London, Printed and sold by Darton and Harvey, 1814.</note>  of the spreading of truth in Norway, convinced of Friends’ principles by the medium of immediate revelation and of the propriety and necessity of silent worship by divine inspiration in an uncommon manner. Although wars hath prevailed and dreadful wickedness, yet there seem something like light breaking forth in many places and a great stir and inquiry amongst the people.
[marginal note] So warm the horses sweat. A few days ago, it froze at the end of their noses.
6. First Day. At our meeting came off middling. E.R. and J.R. appeared very warm, swept away the great snow – extreme great and sudden changes of weather. A few days ago it was so freezing cold that it froze icicles to end of the horses’ noses, and now so warm they sweat to a froth. Pamphlets now came out giving accounts of the dreadful destruction by the wars in Germany the like I never heard of in our days. Burning houses, town, and villages, destruction by sword, famine and pestilence all abound there. Dreadful scarcity of bread, thousands and thousands of families burnt out of house and home, thousands of children left helpless, fatherless and motherless, almost naked and exposed to very cold winter weather. Many thousands of pounds sent from England for the relief of these sufferers. Committees, both of men and women of the highest rank in life, appointed both in England and Germany to take care of the poor, especially the vast numbers of poor children, and great charity, benevolence and extensive care taken.
<pb id="A0011526_066"/>
9th Third Month, 1815. Our Monthly Meeting. Forepart satisfactory, but the latter part not so to me. Oh, how slippery is our standing, as William Penn says, like soldiers in battle always in danger. I am too apt to press things closer than they can well bear. Fine, spring like weather. It is said the way to heaven is by the gates of Hell; so I find it often and hard beset to get by them.
[marginal note] Very fine spring weather.
12. First Day. At our meeting. Samuel Leeds, a youngish man from Egg Harbor, was large and acceptable in testimony, and it ended satisfactory to me and all others as far as I could see. Is it not remarkable how ministers are raised up yet in every corner in our society?
14. Went to our select meeting at Haddonfield. Micajah Collins of New England was there and had very acceptable service, a workman that need not be ashamed. He with our friend Thomas Lippincott has this winter and fall been a long journey to the Western Country and to Carolina, out seven months. Thomas tells me that the fever and great sickness prevails to an alarming degree in Carolina and parts of Virginia: whole families almost taken away in some instances. And Susannah Smith, a young woman of Burlington, spoke largely and made a very notable prayer. A satisfactory, owning, strengthening time: surely the hand of the Lord is in it. In sending laborers.
15. At quarterly meeting Micajah Collins was raised in great eminence and had very pertinent, extensive service - an owning, favored, famous meeting. What a mercy it is that such a backsliding people should be thus labored with and that there is such able amiable ministers, [and?] laborers yet continued. Where or in what society is the like to be found? Be thou instructed, oh, Jerusalem, etc. <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 6:8</note>  . Oh, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee, etc. <note resp="transcr">Matthew 23:37</note>  . If the great and mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes, etc. <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:13</note>  . Is it not to be feared that this remark is too true? They go to their meeting and are much pleased with their fine preaching and return and remain just the same. As it was said to the prophet, they come before thee as my people; and sit before thee as my people they hear thy words but will not do them. Each one returns to his covetousness. Thy words are to them as a pleasant song of one that hath a pleasant voice, etc. <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:31-32</note>  . But religion will not always be trifled with, as we read; the Lord will not always strive with man, etc. <note resp="transcr">Genesis 6:3</note>  . Where much will be given much will be required <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:48</note>  .
18 of the Third Month, 1815. Was First Day. At our meeting, and a precious, owning, open, strengthening time it was – seldom the like I remember. Now the words of the prophet teach me so to number my days that I may apply mine heart to wisdom <note resp="transcr">Psalm 90:12</note>  . Christ is said to be the wisdom of God and the power of God, who, we read, gives liberally, etc. <note resp="transcr">James 1:5</note>  . If I number my days that are past, they are now near 75 years.
[marginal note] A great, cold, long storm.
23. At our preparative meeting, where was a marriage: John Matlack and Ann Lippincott. Came off middling well satisfied, yet great want of that ancient dew of Hermon [Psalm 133:3]. Much straitened to get another horse; went to several vendues to try to get suited. Oh, to see the faces of many poor captives to strong drink! With divers of this sort I have lately had some lively, pertinent opportunities. Unexpectedly, they themselves opened the way for it, as if they wanted to talk with me about this – their great weakness and failing. Some were tendered even to tears, expressing a fear that they were lost in an affecting manner. A few weeks ago, I was at a neighbor’s house who made no profession of religion of any sort, though very industrious outwardly and frugal and orderly. It came into to my mind to say, you want but one thing more to make you as happy as it is possible for people to be on earth. What is that? said the woman. More religion, more goodness, I suppose – from whence a lively discourse proceeded to edification, I hope, and satisfaction.
About this time we hear of three or four most sorrowful accounts of young men taking to excess in drinking and several of the first rate families amongst Friends breaking up, making vendues after their parents had been at great expense buying farms and selling them. Grievous, grievous, heart piercing troubles indeed.

26 of the Third Month, 1815. First Day. At our meeting. Came off without condemnation, although not that sweetness, savor and life as last First Day. It is but rarely I have a downright good, satisfactory meeting. I now hear of seven people being drowned in the river against Cenemencen [Cinnaminson?]. The packet boat overset, fourteen passengers in it and seven lost. It is said the captain was in drink. Oh, see the many sorrowful effects of drunkenness!
[marginal note] much stormy weather
30. Some discourse with poor drunkards. I happened to be at the house of one who came home very much disordered with drink. I asked him what he thought would become of him if he went on so. I don’t know, said he, I am afraid I shall go to hell. I told him he might be sure of it if he went on so. He died very suddenly sometime after. Another, under great remorse of conscience, lamenting his sorrowful condition, called rum, blass [indecipherable] nation, stuff, put his hand to his breast and said, here is enough, God condemns me and he died in the midst of his days in a miserable manner. They were men of estates. Another, after some discourse, said with a low voice, I am lost, I am lost. Looking up another poor old Indian, I asked him what he thought would become of him if he went on getting drunk. He said, I don’t know, I suppose I must bear it. I told him he had better leave off and then he would not have to bear it. He answered no. So we may see that all believe in the doctrine of immortality, however inconsistent their conduct may be with such a belief. Another poor drunkard said just at last (greatly alarmed) he would sooner suffer his mouth to be sewed up than ever suffer another drop of rum to come in his mouth. But, alas, I might fill a volume of these sorrowful accounts. G.E. of Evesham.
[marginal note] My son Joseph inform that divers hard drinkers have died suddenly in their parts, and one frozen death in the hard, freezing weather.
29. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Silent almost. E.R. said a little. A poor, low time.
[marginal note] Very much rain.
30. I went to Cropwell, having some business. I expected to be at their meeting, but they changed the day from Sixth to Fifth Day. So I went to see Priscilla Wells, a choice exemplary Friend in the ministry, very ill with the fever prevailing in many places. Heard of the death of a young woman – Bulah Hollen, about 25, died with the consumption at Moorestown – and of a young man at Moorestown, about 25. He has been poorly, several months in a declining state, but at last, they say, a gathering came on his throat and choked him to death. See the solemn calls to all sorts – these were of poor families. Another, in the midst of his days, had a great estate, a valuable choice wife and large family of fine children. [He] destroyed himself with drinking to excess. I went to see him and got there just after he was dead, and they told me he cried out just at last, why did you not keep strong drink from me? His wife answered, my dear, thee knows we could not.
[marginal note] Much complaints of ulcerated sore throats of late S.L.
{1815-04}
2nd Third [Fourth] Month. First Day. At our meeting there was a good deal said, but it seemed as if something was wanting. If the dead rise not, preaching is in vain, etc. <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:14</note>  . We read the the word preached formerly had not much effect where the hearts of the people were not prepared and that Christ did not many mighty works amongst some formerly; so we read, some seed fell amongst stony, thorny ground, etc. <note resp="transcr">Matthew 13:5-7</note>  .
Seventh Day. Our daughter, Hannah, brought a printed paper from town giving an account of four persons being drowned in Boston Harbor on First Day afternoon. Going out in a boat in a party of pleasuring a sailing in, a violent squall of wind and heavy thundershower overset the boat. Oh, to see the frequent solemn calls and warnings and how little effect they have! I believe I could mention twenty instances of young people being drowned on the First Day, going out in parties of pleasuring, skating, swimming, skeeting, sledding, sailing, sleighing, etc., and divers of them Friends’ children, whilst their parents were at meeting.
6 of the Fourth Month. Was our Monthly Meeting <note resp="transcr">Chester Monthly Meeting minutes, April 1815: “Thomas Burrough laid down a paper wherein he acknowledges sorrow for having paid a [malicious?</note> fine. Thomas Lippincott and John Hunt are appointed to visit him on the occasion and report to next meeting.”]  and I do think it was a favored, open, owning time, to good satisfaction to me throughout. Oh, what a precious blessing yet continued at times to an ungrateful people, amongst whom too little real zeal for the Lord’s cause and too much of the love of the things of this world prevails! Some most bright and knowing about worldly matters and improving are the most dull and drowsy in religion. Mordecai, after a time of favor, we read, sat at the king’s gate <note resp="transcr">Ester 2:19</note>   and also Daniel <note resp="transcr">Daniel 2:49</note>  . Blessed is the man that is found watching at wisdom’s gate and waiting at the posts of her door. Is there any other way or place of safety? No longer watch, no longer safe, no ways capable of preserving our selves one hour, but like the beasts prone to earthliness. As David said, I was as a beast before thee <note resp="transcr">Psalm 73:22</note>  .
<pb id="A0011526_068"/>
See Daniel 11:35, verse: And some of them of understanding shall fall to try them (as in the case of that once dignified servant of the Lord James Naylor and to purge, and to make them white even to the time of the end, etc., and see Ecclesiastes <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 3:18-21</note> : I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts 19 for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them. As one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath. So that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast for all is vanity, all go to one place, all are of the dust and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth.
Heard of three or four being drowned – a boat over set being loaded with fish in a hard squall of wind.
9 of the Fourth Month, 1815. Was First Day. My wife and I and daughter Abigail went to Westfield meeting. I thought there were signs of its being a time of general satisfaction, very kind, free, open and pleasant. After meeting, dined at our dear friend Thomas Lippincott’s, who has lately returned from a journey of six or seven months with Micajah Collins of New England. They were at Ohio Yearly Meeting and there away and in Carolina and Virginia were at our cousin Nathan Hunt’s and gave comfortable accounts, etc. After meeting, Thomas and I visited Isaac Burrough’s to satisfaction about his paying a fine.
This morning, I heard of the death of our dear friend Priscilla Wills, who I visited a few days ago. She has of latter time appeared acceptable in the ministry. I and my wife and daughter were just setting off to Westfield, I being pre-engaged. I am informed that Richard Jordan was at her burial and had very acceptable service both at the house and at the meeting. This day I picked up two small books. One was an excellent account of Barnaby Nixon of Carolina. <note resp="transcr">Barnaby Nixon, Extracts from the manuscript writing of Barnaby Nixon, deceased. Richmond : J. Warrock, printer, 1814.</note>  He died with a cancer in his eye. A worthy minister, many lively Instructing remarks there is in it. See page 32: on my way home (from a quarterly meeting) observing a house much shattered with the thunder (while I was gone) I stopped to inquire whether any lives were lost. I was informed that a number of people were in the house – one was much burnt with the lightning, but no one killed. These things are very awful, but he whose mind is stayed on the Lord is kept in perfect peace, page 32. The other was a small book giving a wonderful account of the life of John Newton <note resp="transcr">Richard Cecil, Memoirs of the Rev. John Newton, late rector of the united parishes of St. Mary Woolnoth, and St. Mary Woolchurch Haw, Lombard Street; with general remarks on his life, connexions, and character. New-York : Thomas A. Ronalds, bookseller and stationer, 1809.</note>  and his deliverances by many evident acts of providence, like as in bringing back the prodigal son of old. See page 213: I have read of many wicked popes, but the worst pope I ever met with is pope self; and see page 242: John Newton used to say that if any one criterion could be given of a real work of grace begun in the heart of a sinner, it would be found in the contrite spirit. We read: a broken heart and a contrite spirit the Lord will not despise. But alas, how seldom found now in our days, whilst outward blessings are showered down in a very bountiful manner! Is it so, the fruitfulness of the earth causes barrenness in the minds of the people? Indeed, they that have most of it seem most dull, poor, and barren in religion or heavenly treasure. Thus, as we read, there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 13:7</note>  , etc.
13. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Very dull and very poor. Which state is to be preferred to be deprived of our religious liberty by cruel, hard hearted persecutors of or to be cheated out of the benefit of them by an easeful, lukewarm state of mind? John Griffith remarks that Christianity made its entrance into the world through all opposition and flourished till wealth and prosperity increased among them, and then they increased much in outward form and ceremony but lost the life and power. I now hear of a young man drowning himself. It is said a company went out a sailing in a party of pleasuring and he jumped of the boat with all his might. And of another dismal account, a young woman murdered and found dead in the road near J. Hain’s ferry, either shot or stabbed in the breast. We hear of dreadful confusion at our river, quarreling about their fishing place so as to shooting one another near unto death.
<pb id="A0011526_069"/>
I am told 170 have been drowned this spring between Baltimore and New York and in our river.
17 Fourth Month, 1815. See John Newton's sayings, page 205: if we were upon the watch for improvement, the common news of the day would furnish it. The falling of the tower in Siloam and the slaughter of the Galileans were the news of the day which our Lord improved.
170, they say, drowned this spring between Baltimore and New York and in our river. We now hear of a number of people being drowned at Egg Harbor: two vessels driven on land by a hard wind going from New York to Baltimore, thirty-seven or more.
See Newton, page 204: a man is not taught any thing to purpose till God becomes his teacher, and then the glare of the world is put out and the value of the soul rises in full view, etc. Again see do., page 201: there are critical times of danger after great services, honor, and consolations; we should stand upon our guard. Noah, Lot, Solomon, David, fell in these circumstances. Satan is a footpad; a footpad will not attack a man in going to the bank but in returning with his pocket full of money. And so indeed I have often found it and have often been robbed. Blessed is the man that is found watching at wisdom’s gate, waiting at the posts of her doors. Mordecai and Daniel, we read, did so. That is, we read they sat at the king’s gate <note resp="transcr">Esther 2:19, Daniel 2:49</note>  .
[marginal note] Again, see Newton page 213: If Nebuchadnezzar’s image was of solid gold and every worshiper was to have a bit of it, I fear our nation as well as his would be ready to fall down before it.
Seventh Day afternoon I went to the burial of Elizabeth Matlack, wife of Jeremiah Matlack, near eighty years old. Has lain in a declining, weak state four years and five months, mostly confined to her bed. So we see it is tedious days and wearisome nights are appointed unto some, as Job of old said <note resp="transcr">Job 7:3</note>  ; others die in their full strength in the midst of days. Death is certain to all, but the time when the manner how is a secret. But happy are they who in time wisely prepare for it. This is the one thing needful above all things to be concerned about on all occasions. Had some satisfaction at the conclusion.
[marginal note] See Barnaby Nixon's little book, page 35: I often humbly desired that I might be kept as submissive [to] the creator as the clouds, which he raises and fills with water when he pleases to pour forth showers on the earth and then pass into nothingness again. Oh, what a blessed, safe state to dwell in!
16. First Day. My daughter Hannah went with me to Philadelphia to the Yearly Meeting. Got to the afternoon meeting. Richard Mott was large in testimony, manifested himself a workman. An amiable, able minister.
Second Day opened the Yearly Meeting in a very orderly, solid manner.
3[rd day] Entered into a consideration of the state of society as reported in the answers to the queries. A more open time and lively zeal I seldom if ever seen on the subject, and poor little me was again, once more, owned amongst them in the exercise that prevailed and in a distinguished manner owned. Many friends with whom I had contracted some acquaintance in Pennsylvania, traveling amongst them, seemed very glad to see me and shewed a great deal of love and respect, divers telling me they thought I had been dead, I having been missing from Yearly Meeting six or several years, having steadily attended that meeting forty years or more. It was quite affecting to see and feel the love and respect they seemed to show for me. We stayed till 4 days and then came home, both of us being very poorly. I was not able to bear the closeness of the city and long sittings and vastly large meetings. It is said the house holds about two thousand people and full crowded every sitting. We got up to our meeting on Fifth Day, though small and dull with some, yet some lively zeal appeared in others. Came off middling well satisfied. Heard of the death of our worthy Friend Anna Mifflin and some think she died with a broken heart. One son went crazy and the other – worse – into the wars, which some thought shortened her days. These were the sons of that worthy elder Warner Mifflin. Heard that the malignant fever rages in places in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Our dear cousin, Nathan Hunt, was at this Yearly Meeting and a very large number of very great able ministers were there from different parts. A friend was reading an account in the news of a most dreadful burning mountain that burst out lately with, as it were, vomiting a river of fire so that it destroyed five towns and quickly destroyed a vast number of people, showers of red-hot stone falling as thick as hail, and the people that escaped with life were left in the most distressed state of wretchedness, poverty and want of the necessaries of life, equal to the destruction of Sodom.

<pb id="A0011526_070"/>
See <italic>Memoirs of the Life of John Newton</italic>, page 214: the devil told a lie when he said all these things are mine and to whomsoever I will I give them. For if he had the disposal of preferments, since he knows the effects of them, you and I, brother C., should soon be dignitaries.
23. First Day. At our meeting. Came off middling well, I hope.
Second and Third Day. I was very poorly – had fever and felt at time chilly. This evening our esteemed cousin Nathan Hunt of North Carolina and Granvil Woolman came here to lodged with us, and very comfortable their company was.
26. Cousin Nathan had an appointed meeting at Moorestown. It was very large and many there that very seldom go to meetings of any sort. Nathan had very excellent, extensive, pertinent, acceptable service. Granvil Woolman and myself occupied some of the time, and I believe the meeting was to general good satisfaction. Great openness and nearness and pleasantness appeared amongst the people after meeting – a solid, open, owning time.
[marginal note] But poorly. Had a slow, lingering fever. Could hardly keep up.
27. Our daughter and I went to Westfield. There Nathan Hunt and Micajah Collins of New England had both of them very extraordinary service amongst a mixture of several sorts, Methodists and others. We spent the afternoon chiefly with our friends Thomas Lippincott, very pleasantly and comfortably. Our cousin Nathan returned to Philadelphia. Our folks say I mostly bring a new book home with me and I suppose it frequently is so. At cousin Henry Warrington’s I picked up a new book, <italic>The Life and Religious Experience of Mary Alexander of Old England</italic>. Very lively, deep and savory are many of the accounts of her deep baptisms and also great experience of heavenly goodness. See page 105: I underwent the deepest baptism I ever experienced. Then again, presently, same page: it was a night which I desire may ever remain in my remembrance with reverent thankfulness to the blessed author of all good. I thought to feel what I then felt uninterruptedly would without augmentation constitute a joyful eternity. In the latter part are memorials concerning several ministering Friends and others deceased. Divers of them I have seen and heard very precious animating accounts. See page 111, of Thomas Comstock, who was traveling, visiting meeting when it was newly settled: they say we often beheld in him a dignified example of solemn silence. 
[marginal note] A silent standard bearer is as acceptable to the Lord as a loud speaking one 
A great difference between that and an easy, trifling, sleepy, lukewarm, wandering mind. Again, see account of Mary Alexander, page 138, her sense of the state of a man declining in religion, fearing he was looking to be made perfect in the flesh: the word preached did not appear to have much entrance into the hearts of some, but blessed be the name of him whom I desire to serve. Not the fruits of our doings but the faithfulness of our hearts commends his dedicated servants to his divine acceptance.
30 of the Fourth Month. At our meeting Micajah Collins was there and had open, extensive, acceptable service and myself occupied a small part of the time and it ended well although I thought not so much of the savor of life as last Fifth Day. Times and seasons are not in our own hands.
Last week, again, another sorrowful scene; a youngish woman, having a husband and five or six children, not far from Burlington, having been subject at times to lowness of mind went upstairs, took a tape string, fastened it at each end to something, then laid her chin or throat upon it. There ended her days. Born and brought up in this neighborhood.
{1815-05}
1815, 4 of the Fifth Month. At our Monthly Meeting. Benjamin Swett and his wife and Elizabeth Balderston of Pennsylvania paid us a very acceptable visit. Lodged with us and went with us to Monthly Meeting, which I thought on the whole was to general satisfaction and ended savory and very well.
<pb id="A0011526_071"/>
1815, 5 of the Fifth Month. I went to Evesham Monthly Meeting, which I thought very low and poor, indeed, at first, but Micajah Collins stood up and spoke very pertinently to the state of the meeting and I thought did famously and worthily, and it ended very lively, savory, and well. I had good satisfaction, although so poorly it was hard for me to sit.
8. First Day. At our meeting so poorly I was hardly able to keep up. I had not much satisfaction. My disorder influenza deeply affect my stomach. A violent, tight, hard cough, which affects my head.
11. Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and J. C. says very poor to him forepart, but growed better and at last favored with a little of that which I believe bare, dry formalists are not acquainted with, and it ended to my satisfaction and peace of mind.
[marginal note] About planting, but I am not able to help but very little.
14. First Day. At our meeting, although trifling indifferency too much prevailed in many, yet I believe there was something owning at last and gathering and reputable. A number of strangers there. All pretty well at last.
2nd. See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Power of Religion on the Mind</italic>, page 15, Concerning Francis Walsingham, one of the greatest amongst men: when near his end he became deeply impressed with a solemn sense of the superior importance of religion to all other considerations. Again, see same book, page 17, of M. A. Shurman: at last expressed a desire to lay down all the glory she had acquired by means of her great acquirements, that so she might attain the favor of God as her principle treasure and cause of rejoicing. There are two sorts of treasures, delights, joys, and pleasures. The one is short and transitory; the other is permanent, unspeakable, and durable (see Alexander Arscott’s writing page 103) and in the experience of it consists the highest evidence of the Christian religion. Oh, what wisdom it would be to set our hearts and minds on treasures, joys, and pleasures that are permanent and durable etc. Again, see page A. Arscott’s 96: for what greater pleasure can there be conceived than that which a virtuous, pious soul enjoys when in its faithful walking in obedience to God it finds its peace to flow and the light of his countenance to shine upon it, by which those who are enjoyers of it are sensible of more real comfort at heart than when their corn and wine increase or any other external thing increased and much more so than in counterfeit pleasure, treasure in vicious courses.
[marginal note] Cold, much rain.
18. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though small and many very drowsy, it was not so to me – the advantage of keeping the mind and dependence on him on whom help is laid and is able to abilitate for all required. Came off without condemnation and with a degree of satisfaction.
[marginal note] Rain rainy hold cold
Directly after writing this I took up [Robert] Barclay’s <italic>Apology </italic>and opened it on this, page 360: for as our worship consisteth not in words so neither in silence as silence but in an holy dependence of the mind upon God, etc. I laid by Barclay and in a little time took it up again. See page 541. I think it appears to me that what is wrote in that page – that people worship that which they love best and what their hearts minds and affections and desires are placed upon, whether it be the most desirable deserving object or something else. As we read, they worshiped the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:8</note>   and as John Staupitz <note resp="transcr">Johann von Staupitz, 1460-1524</note>  , one of the first reformers, said: he that loves God, serves him. He that doth not love him neither doth nor can serve him, however great acts of devotion he may outwardly perform. So, as one remarks, direful are the consequences of desires and affection misplaced, as we see verified in many instances.
21 was First Day. Having liberty of our Monthly Meeting, I appointed a meeting at Hartford, about twenty miles up in the barrens where the Indians formerly lived. It was a weighty undertaking, and I waded under great discouragement and had to get along against wind and tide, outwardly and inwardly, but I have heard say, where there is a will, there will be a way, and so it was. For after I set off, we went like flying. Joshua Stokes and wife and my son John went with me and a satisfactory meeting it was, as divers expressed. Broke up about one o’clock and we got well home. These people are making great improvements where the Indians lived a few years ago and wished for more such meetings.
[marginal note] A poor widow lives near this meeting, has several children. She told me she had to chop all her own firewood last cold winter. A thought struck me – to try to collect something for her – and rested with me.
<pb id="A0011526_072"/>
Seventh Day Evening
See <italic>Testimonies of Public Friends Deceased <note resp="transcr">1760</note>  </italic>, page 188, of the Monthly Meeting of Norwich in England of Thomas White, a worthy, eminent minister. After having labored very much, they say some few years before he died a very close trial befell him in his own family, which much affected his spirits. And though friends were very tenderly concerned for him, and that he might be preserved in his service as before, yet his weakness rather increased till his health became very much impaired and his understanding weakened, so that we suffered the loss of him in our meetings some time before his death, of which we were very sensible. Yet friends were satisfied he ended well, aged 69, a minister forty years. Oh, to think of the troubles and trials that attend the best of men and women! Many are the troubles even of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all. Our worthy friend Ann Mifflin died a few months ago and some think the conduct of her children shortened her days. Ye have made me to stink amongst the inhabitants of the Land, among the Canaanites and Perizezites, said good old Jacob <note resp="transcr">Genesis 44:31</note> , and what was the language of Rebecah if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, etc. <note resp="transcr">Genesis 27:46</note>  . Bring down their grey hairs with sorrow to the grave . No doubt many have died of mere grief and trouble with a broken heart.
[marginal note] Whilst man in this imperfect state of being is confined, what pains assail this outward frame, what sorrow vex his mind.
The apostle said he had no greater joy than to see his children walk in the truth <note resp="transcr">3 John 1:4</note>  , and on the other hand is there any greater sorrow than to see the walk in the broad way that leads to destruction? Oh, how many serious calls to a devout and holy life! A few days ago, a young woman, by a fall from a window on a piece of timber, hurt her back so that she has no use of her limbs below the heart nor ever like to have since that. T. Balinger’s son had his wagon run over him loaded with wood. Our neighbor Thomas Bispham, with several other families, got all ready to set off to Miami – 600 miles – is taken very ill. In these times of trouble, conscience has room to plead. But whilst in health many are so full of worldly concerns that the council of best wisdom is too little thought of or attended to. Yet how doth the things of this world and the concerns of it sink into an equal nothingness when death and eternity appears in full view! Then, as William Penn says, the cry is a world of gold and of pearl for a little more time! When they have been giving up all their time and talents for a little of this uncertain World. I forgot to note: last Fifth Day at our preparative meeting forepart some life, though many very drowsy. Money matter heard at last.
[marginal note] J. Hain’s daughter near where I had the meeting last First Day.
[marginal note] 1815 A young woman, V. Frinch’s daughter, lost her reason.
28 of the Fifth Month. First Day. At our meeting. I thought on the whole a much life and savor as is common amongst us, but, oh, how little of that to what we might experience if we were truly faithful and in earnest! Yet I wonder there was as much as there was, considering the lukewarmness and indifferency, love of this world and ingratitude.
{1815-06}
Fifth Day. At our meeting. Silent as to myself, though not the poorest to me.
Sixth Day. At our select meeting very low and poor, dry and dull forepart, but ended lively, though rather mortifying than satisfactory to me. They cannot bear my rubbing and I doubt I don’t do it so smooth and well as I ought to do.
[marginal note] A soaking rain after several weeks’ dry weather.
Seventh Day I was catched  out in a soaking shower (on the place) at which time there was some pretty hard thunder as we stood under an apple tree, and I am told a pair of oxen killed with the thunder a few miles of, at near Cropwell on Joseph Evan’s place.
4 of the Sixth Month. First Day. We went to Cropwell Meeting. Came off pretty well, I hope and believe to general satisfaction. Heard of the death of Thomas Warrington, son of Abraham, a very stout, tall, healthy, young man who was here about amongst his relation last winter from Ohio, where it is said the malignant fever now much prevails, and of the deaths of several others natives of our parts.
8. Was our Monthly Meeting and an open, lively, favored one it was or we were deceived. All seemed sweet and pleasant after meeting.
11. First Day. We – that is, my wife and daughter Hannah – went to Haddonfield meeting. Very large, full, crowded. Our cousin, Nathan Hunt, was there, whose testimony was very extensive and lively. We stayed their afternoon meeting, which was large and lively. I had a share in the labor to good satisfaction, though poorly.
[marginal note] Dined at Sarah Cresson’s, that sweet minister.
<pb id="A0011526_073"/>
1815, 13 of the Sixth [Month], Third of the week. Our dear worthy cousin, Nathan Hunt of North Carolina appointed a meeting at Cropwell, which at first was low, poor and trying, but after a time of close labor the waters seemed to rise, and it ended very lively, savory, and well. Our cousin had extensive service at last.
14. Was our select quarterly meeting at Evesham. N[athan]. Hunt and Richard Jordan and John Shoemaker had very extraordinary, close, searching service, the like, I thought, I scarcely ever heard and I have often thought of late very much needed, for I think the children and them like lookers-on may see the dryness, dullness, formality, and indifferency amongst many of the fore rank amongst us, although in temporal interest lively enough. I lodged with those dear worthy friends at William Rogers’s, and most sweetly did we enjoy one another’s company. Comforting, animating, and instructing it was. I had renewed cause to conclude it was well worthwhile to strive to do right yet.
15. Was quarterly meeting at Evesham and our dear cousin, N. Hunt, had very extensive, searching service. Indeed, he seemed to get through and to saving clear to his own peace and satisfaction and to the great satisfaction of his friends, as appeared by the endorsement on his certificate now given him, and John Shoemaker of Pennsylvania also said considerable. Is become an able minister, though but young in the ministry. An highly favored, open, owning time, although there were much signs of an earthly, dull spirit in some who should, and would if they had kept their places, been as standard bearers, who were closely searched out.
I forgot to put it in its place above; our worthy cousin and his companions, Benjamin Gillingham and Josiah Albertson of Pennsylvania, after dining at Hannah and her sister’s – Lippincott’s – and having a lively sitting in the family where were several young men. And one, though he looked pretty hardy was reached and tendered. They came home with us to lodge and went with me to select meeting and dined at our son John’s. Precious was their company at our house. Indeed, I suppose or believe that our cousin Nathan Hunt, Richard Jordan, and Jesse Hersey are looked upon and allowed to be the three greatest ministers in America. Nathan Hunt and Richard Jordan were natives of Carolina, brought up with little if any more school than so as to be capable of reading the Scriptures and writing a letter, etc., and Jesse Hersey was put apprentice to a potter, his school learning small as the others’. Yet the tongue of the learned is given them and they are very great orators and often use every sublime language. Richard Jordan said lately that William Hunt, Nathan’s father, was the greatest man Carolina ever held, and I heard him once say fifty years ago at Haddonfield Quarterly Meeting that he was like something picked up in the wilderness in Carolina and when a little turned of 14 years of age, a gift of the ministry was committed to his trust. And a great and powerful minister he was, a son of thunder like some of old; I heard of his preaching 4 hours at a time once. But Paul continued his speech until midnight and then talked a great while till break of day etc. Oh, the unspeakable mercy of our great Creator continued to this day, as formerly when he said I will send for hunters and hunt them and fishers and fish them and set watchmen over them <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 16:16</note>  , saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet and to give the alarm as faithful watchmen when they seeth enemy approaching in an earthly, easeful, lukewarm state threatening great desolation at this time which they faithfully testified against in a powerful awakening manner. Is there any people favored in like degree with such watchmen? We hear that the malignant fever prevails in an alarming manner at Ohio and Redstone and of the death of several very stout young people lately are dead with it: Thomas Warrington who was lately here, and Enoch Cattle and his wife, Elijah Frinch and Jonah Cadwallader, all very stout, lusty, and strong – and that it has been very mortal in Carolina, Virginia, and divers other places.

18 of the Sixth Month, 1815. First Day. At our meeting and through unmerited mercy, I believe, it was a lively, owning time with some. Amos Hilburn, a young minister of Byberry, Pennsylvania, was there and had acceptable service. I went with him to Westfield in the afternoon to a meeting he had appointed, which seemed low and poor at first. He seemed to have hard, dull work getting along at first, but it growed better and ended very well at last. At our meeting, an invitation was given to the burial of Edmund Darling, Junior of Evesham, a stout, healthy, young man about 18 or 19. It is said he was there at our meeting the First Day before in perfect health; was killed with the kick of a horse on his breast; lived after the kick about 48 hours and was so well as to walk about the room on First Day morning and his parents left him and went to meeting, but he died before they got back. I have thought that when he was at our meeting the First Day before, how alarming would it have been to him if he had been told that an invitation would be given to his own burial the next First Day! There has been several very alarming calls to that family within a few years; one of their daughters but a few months ago from a very small wound died suddenly with the lock jaw, and a young man got hurt at the moving of a building and died there, and his wife had a very bad spell of sickness, and one of their other daughters become quite a cripple through a spell of sickness. So it is, call after call after divers ways and diver manners. Several times I have seemingly narrowly escaped being killed with the kick of a horse and how greatly was our worthy friend John Reeves once wounded with the kick of a horse and once almost killed with a fall out of his carriage. John Reeves buried 10 of First Month 1816.
22. Was our preparative meeting. Something very lively and savory first sitting, so that it seemed a little like what I have seen of the account amongst our Friends in early times. When they met at a meeting for discipline, there was such a flowing of life that one after another had so much to communicate that they were forced to adjourn and so again when they met the second time, till they adjourned the 3rd time before they could go to the business of the discipline. But our discipline meeting was not altogether satisfactory to me. They have a right to censure who have an [heart to help and none else. What is our discipline but poor, dry formality without an  heart to help? The shepherds of Israel were complained of formerly because they had not sought after the scattered of the flock, them that had been driven away, nor endeavored to heal the sick lame and wounded <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 34:2-4</note>  , etc.
[marginal note] A soaking rain, great storm.
25. First Day. At our meeting. Joseph Justice had a good deal to say and some others, but the waters was too low for me to venture, so kept still. Went with J.M. and wife and Rebecca Cowperthwaite to see William Venible’s family. Came off pretty well. Very busy getting hay and favored to get along very well. Dry, good hay weather.
29 Fifth Day. At our meeting. Joseph Justice had something pretty lively and several others.
[marginal note] Grows very dry.
{1815-07}
2 of the Seventh Month First Day. At our meeting. Seldom more manifestly owned and favored, although I was alone in one sense; Ann Edwards not there. We have been very busy getting hay and very much favored getting it in, very sweet and very excellent good, our barn nearly full. I am enabled to work a good deal.
6. Our Monthly Meeting. Sarah Cresson and Deborah Stuart were there. Had excellent service; Sarah, especially, was large and most precious, savory, pertinent, and lively, respecting, living up to our profession and very encouraging and instructing to the youth. Seldom seen more savor and life amongst all the great preachers we have had of late or of near. A precious, satisfactory, lively meeting it was throughout, though small. Just the beginning of harvest.
Seventh Day. A very wet morning. See Richard Claridge’s <italic>Works, </italic>page 234: Quakerism, as George Keith truly describes it, is nothing else but pure Christianity restored again unto the world by the mighty operation of the power and spirit of God after so long and so dark a night of apostasy. It rains very hard.
[marginal note] Seventh Day. A great rain, got most of our hay in.
<pb id="A0011526_075"/>
1815 9th of the Seventh Month. First Day. At our meeting Joseph Justice was there, but the waters so low none could go until just at last I had some relief. About reaping, very wet weather.
I hear that Israel Hulling of Evesham was at market on Third Day and was brought home a corpse on Fourth Day.
13. Fifth Day. Came off middling. meeting small, midst of harvest.
Six and Seventh Days. Getting in our harvest, etc. Fine and dry, although a few days ago we seemed threatened with too much wet, very hot weather.
[marginal note] Very pleasantly showers round about in places.
16. First Day. My neighbor, Samuel Church took me to Westfield meeting, which to me was middling satisfactory, although great lukewarmness and trifling indifferency and drowsiness; a spirit of ease invades our meetings. We dined at William Burrough’s. Thomas Lippincott, William Evans and I went to see Joseph Morgan and inform him of the judgment of the Monthly Meeting for his paying a fine or demand for military demands. To some satisfaction in clearing ourselves, although he seemed settled on his dues. This week, helping my son getting of hay and got along bravely. Dry weather.
Fifth Day. At our meeting which was small, people very busy amongst their hay. Joseph Justice had a pretty deal to say and I thought pretty pertinent and lively with me – I might say another stemed in. I have often thought of a piece of an old Scotch song I have heard. A little old Scotchman used often to sing – My heart’s in the highlands / My heart is not here / My heart’s in the highland chasing of the deer / A chasing of back and hunting the doe / My heart's in the highlands wherever I go. People may go to meeting and the heart, in the farm, in the earth, draw nigh with all outward appearance whilst the heart far from being rightly centered. See Richard Claridge’s <italic>Works</italic> page 425: he quotes the words of Georgius Magor, a zealous, useful, religious man who asserted that they that were no studious of good works could not obtain eternal life and that the study of good works was necessary to salvation. But our minds seem to be so taken up with the crowding cares and cumbering concerns of this world (especially in the busy season of the year) that very many seem to have no time to study about anything else but for the body.
[marginal note] Very hot, dry weather. We hear of much sickness about Moorestown: flux in many families. Grows very dry, corn and vines pinched for want of rain.
23. Seventh Month. First Day. In Richard Claridge’s <italic>Works</italic> I find these words: it is a great and glorious thing to be a Christian, because we may see the effects of faithfulness to the Christian principle is so great and glorious. It is a great thing and weighty, as John Woolman observes, to make a profession of the Christian religion as most nowadays do. But as Claridge say, or an author he quotes, that to profess the Christian religion and not walk answerable to it is the greatest enmity to religion and as another observed that truth has ever suffered most from its professed advocates for want of sincerity.
[marginal note] A fine shower. Very busy getting hay and favored to get along bravely and I helped considerably.
Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting and not the poorest to me, though very small. People very busy about getting hay. I have thought how it would so for an highly professing people in religion and to very great refinement to lay by religion and attending meetings all the busy season of the year. It is recorded that our first friends would tend their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground, or that their persecutors said they would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground. They then got something by attending their meeting that they could rejoice in more than the increase of corn, wine or oil. And as one of old said, I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food <note resp="transcr">Job 23:12</note>  . For as we read, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God <note resp="transcr">Luke 4:4</note>  . Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord, as Isaiah says <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 58:14</note>  , and as John Woolman remarks, a joy and delight of all others the most pure, and as Habakkuk says, though the fields yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>  . Oh, blessed and happy state to be in, when all earthly comforts fail, which they very soon must. 
{1815-08}
First First Day in Eighth Month, 1815.
<pb id="A0011526_076"/>
5 of the week 3 of the Eighth Month, 1815. At our meeting to me pretty lively and in a good degree satisfactory. Very dry corn and other things very much pinched for want of rain; although there has been showers all round, yet we have had very little here. Just finished getting hay and oats, etc.
6. First Day. I am told a man by the name of Samuel Porch was killed with the thunder near Salem a few weeks ago and that a young new married woman at Salem cut her own throat. They got the doctor and sewed it up and she lived about a week and then it mortified and killed her a few weeks ago, a daughter of Job Tiler. Went to our meeting. Very dry time, waters very low – mortifying, but perhaps profitable. I hear of several dreadful accidents or circumstances. Samuel Middleton of Haddonfield had his arm cut with a scythe; they said the doctors was two hours taking up and tying the veins or arteries. Another had his leg badly mashed and broken helping [to] move a building by a large pry falling on it. Another, by the name of Cliffen, in a dreadful condition so that his life is much despaired of by treading on one of the little, sharp, prickly sand burrs (much increasing and spreading of latter years). They say there is a hole quite through his foot, and his leg swelled up as big as two, and the swelling run up to his body. Another got terribly burnt with powder, and I am told there has been lately a very great rain, a great fresh and two barns burnt with the lightning near New York. Oh, what humbling, solemn calls to fear and faithfulness. The ancient language was fear God and give glory to His great name for the hour of his judgments is come <note resp="transcr">Revelation 14:7</note>  , and again sanctify the Lord your God and let him be your fear and let him be your dread <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 8:13</note>  , and as one said, sooner or later he will make all to fear him. And as the prophet said, oh, that men would fear the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful kindness to the children of men <note resp="transcr">Psalm 31:19</note>  , and again, oh, that there were such an heart in them to fear me always and keep my commandments, that so it might be well with them and their children forever. For the fear of the Lord keeps the heart clean and is a fountain of life that preserves from the snares of death.
[marginal note] Very dry, pinching drought. Went to my son John’s, about smith work. Had one fine shower, yet it seems soon to want more. Shower almost daily round about, yet corn in many places much pinched.
10. Monthly Meeting. News [from] Hannah of Philadelphia her daughter Hannah, both had lively, pertinent, acceptable service. Afternoon pretty lively and well.
[marginal note] We hear of dreadful wars in France, many thousands slain in one battle. Bonaparte beat and taken prisoner and put in prison, it is said.
13. First Day. Elizabeth Kerling this the 2 [second] time and silent in both. Very low, poor meetings I believe of late. I went to the burial of a poor boy, died with the flux, of Caleb Haines and had satisfaction with a number of the young people. Was a few days ago at the burial of a child of Enoch Roberts’s. Both these died with the flux and now the last out of four of Enoch Robert's children is to be buried tomorrow.
20 of the Eighth Month. First Day. At our meeting not altogether satisfactory to me. Smooth things are most pleasant to hearers and all others, but not always most proper.
24. At our meeting preparative and an owning, satisfactory one it was to me. I find it is as Stephen Crisp [<italic>Scripture Truths Demonstrated]</italic> says: if I can but answer mine own conscience, I need fear no man. If the land is for us, what can harm us? Oh, the many precious promises to those who obtain his favor: the munition of rocks is their defense, bread shall be given them, their waters shall be sure, etc.
27. First Day. Hinchman Haines had a consider[able] to say and Ebenezer Roberts. At a neighbor’s house I picked up a little book called <italic>The Life of George Washington <note resp="transcr">M.L. (Mason Locke) Weems, The life of George Washington. Philadelphia : Printed for M. Carey, 1811. </note> </italic>   and of his great deeds in the Revolutionary War. Page 61: ’tis said in the French and Indian war from 55 to 63 they lost nearly 30,000 of their stoutest young men and by regular returns it appears that Massachusetts alone expanded about £500,000 sterling in that time. Page 107: shall we hence infer with brutes that virtue is an empty name and that anyone was ever good in vain? God forbid! Goodness and happiness are twins; heaven hath joined them together and hell cannot put them asunder. Then he magnifies that power that can support its votaries above the fear of death, verified in the death of one of their leading men.
[marginal note] We have had the glory to conquer our enemies. Now for the greater glory to conquer ourselves (page 121).
<pb id="A0011526_077"/>
This sheet or leaf happened to be left and so I fill it up. The author quoted it and why not [indecipherable].
See Richard Claridge’s <italic>Works,</italic> page 276: An exhortation to faithful obedience to the light of Christ. An excellent piece, at the conclusion of which, page 283, he quotes Archbishops Tillotson’s words in sermons on several occasions, etc. It is not our being guided over with the external profession of Christianity that will avail us; our religion must be a vital principle, inwardly to change and transform us. If by our lives and actions we do contradict that religion which we profess, we do by this very thing prove ourselves to be counterfeits and hypocrites. If a man profess any other art or calling, it is expected that he should be skilled in it and excel those that do not pretend to it. Tis the greatest disparagement to a physician that can be to say of him that he is in other respects an excellent man, only he hath no great skill in diseases and the methods of cure – because this is his profession. He might be pardoned for other defects, but the proper skill of his art may justly be expected from him. So for a Christian to say of him, the worst thing in him is his life. He is very orthodox in his opinions, but he is an ill-natured man, one of very violent passions. He will be very frequently drunk, he makes no conscience of his dealings, he is very uncharitable to all that differ from him. This man is faulty in his profession; he is defective in that which should be his excellency. He may have orthodox opinions in religion, but when all is done there is no such error and heresy, nothing so fundamentally opposite to religion, as a wicked life.  He that would know what a man believes let him attend rather for what he does than to what he talks. He that leads a wicked life makes a more credible and effectual profession of infidelity than he who in words only denies the gospel. It is the hardest thing in the world to imagine that the man believes Christianity who by ungodliness and worldly lusts does deny and renounce it. The greatest enmity to religion is to profess it and live unanswerably to it; A Jew or a Turk is not so great an enemy to Christianity as a lewd and vicious Christian. 
A Christian does not pretend to have a better wit and a more piercing understanding than a Turk or a heathen, but he professes to live better than they, to be more chaste and more temperate man, more just and more charitable, more meek and gentle, more loving and peaceable than other men. If any man professes himself a Christian and do not live better than others, he is a mere pretender and mountebank in religion. And then pressing all those who call themselves Christians to live up to the essential and fundamental laws of religion, the same author sums this up under these heads: to love God and to love our neighbor, to do to every man as we would have him do to us, to mortify our lusts and subdue our passions and sincerity, to endear to grow in every grace and virtue and to abound in all the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ to the praise and glory of God. These are undoubtedly the essential and fundamental laws of religion or Christianity, and they that are found in obedience thereunto are the only true Christians, because they do what Christ requires of them and give up in faithful obedience to his holy and pure divine light, which supports and comforts them under all exercises and temptations; sweetens every cup, though never so bitter to flesh and blood; enables them to surmount all difficulties they meet with; works out all that is of the dark, sinful nature; sanctifies them throughout and makes them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.
A great snow and very cold 12 of the First Month 1816.
<pb id="A0011526_078"/>
13 First Month, 1816,
See Richard Claridge’s work, page 141: among his manuscripts written this year 1703 is found a paper of pious instruction penned for the use of his own daughter, which we here transcribe for the good of others, especially of our youth:
John IV: 24 God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Spiritual worship and none other is acceptable to him. And therefore that thou mayst worship him in spirit and in truth, turn thy mind inward to the light and spirit of Christ in thy own heart, and wait in silence of thy own thoughts, reasonings and words that the Lord may prepare thy heart and provide himself a sacrifice. Keep low and humble at all times, in all places and in all companies, waiting upon thy Heavenly teacher Christ Jesus to hear his voice and to be taught and instructed by him who will draw nigh unto thee as thou drawest nigh unto him and will guide thee with his council as thou givest up in obedience to him. The meek will he guide in judgment, And the meek will he teach his way, Psalms XXV 9. Be frequent in self-examination, and as thou findest any thing in thee that is offensive to the Lord, cry unto him to take it away and to strengthen thee against it and all evil for the time to come. Be always upon thy watch lest the enemy get an advantage over thee and draw thy mind out to the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye and the pride of life. Do not neglect anything that truth commands, nor count anything little that truth forbids, but have a diligent regard to all its requirings.
If others should take more liberty than the truth allows, do, thou neither imitate such nor have society with them. Bad examples and bad company are very dangerous, and therefore avoid them as thou wouldst do an infection.
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but walk in the light of the lamb continually. So shalt thou be a witness of his work, which is to take away the sin of the world. Be faithful to what the Lord hath made known unto thee and as thou art faithful in a little he will make the ruler ever much. He hath given thee the manifestation of his spirit to profit with all. Oh, be not slothful and negligent but give diligence that thy profiting may appear. Learn and practice the lesson of self-denial and take up thy daily cross to the world and everything that is evil in it. The cross is the way to the crown. Thou mayst meet with scoffs and jeers, with revilings and reproaches for the truth’s sake. But when thou art reviled, revile not again; when thou art reproached, bear it patiently and commit thyself to him who judgeth righteously. If ye be reproached (saith Peter) for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you 1 Peter IV: 14. Again, if any suffer as a Christian (that is, upon the account of Christ and his blessed truth), let him not be ashamed but glorify God on this behalf. IV: 16: Blessed are ye, saith Christ, when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name’s sake, rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you Matthew 5:11-12. Choose for thy companions such as excel in piety and virtue. Mind not the outward turnings of the world, but the inward adorning, the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price, for so the holy women in old times who trusted in God adorned themselves.
Be friendly and courteous towards all, and particularly toward thy uncle and aunt, and bear if anything seem hard at any time.
Be no teller of tales, nor busybody in other folks matters. Cause no strife or discord, nor render evil for evil or railing for railing. Disclose not a secret, nor lay open the faults of others. Keep thyself as much as possible to thyself. Be affable, not open; be courteous, not fond or foolish; be as wise as a serpent and innocent as a dove. Watch, pray and patiently continue in well-doing and perfect peace will be thy portion here and eternal glory thy crown hereafter. So have I been employed this 13 of the First Month 1816 with desires that every one of my granddaughters might be furnished with a copy of this precious instruction. A great snow on the ground and freezing cold and see Richard Claridige’s <italic>Works</italic>. Page 534 is an excellent letter exhorting to obedience to the light of Christ or the Lord’s requirings that I should be glad my grandchildren could be furnished with. And in page 540 is also an excellent epistle of Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, to Celenting, a noble matron, instructing her how to live a Holy life, translated from the Latin by Richard Claridge and why not? We as well as he think it worth translating, as well as he. A very great snow and very cold.
<pb id="A0011526_079"/>
6 of Ninth Month, 1815. At our select meeting something lively, owning, and strengthening. See James Goughs's <italic>Journal</italic>, pages 48, 49, and 50 on select meeting so it is.
7. Our Monthly Meeting. Henry Hull of New York State was there and had very acceptable, savory service. He is a very great minister, lately visited Europe. I have almost concluded to stop writing this way, but feel not quite easy. But see a little book lately from England wrote by William Alexander <note resp="transcr">William Alexander, Christian discipline, public religious worship, and gospel ministry, briefly considered. York [Eng.</note> : Printed for the author, 1814.] <italic>,</italic> page 115, a very excellent piece: as exercise of the body promotes the comfort and health of our earthly tabernacles, so exercise of the soul, patiently and rightly maintained, promotes the health and vigor of this noble and immortal part of man. Whatever may be our stage of experience or our relative situations as members of the body, this exercise or engagement of mind is essential. Is it not like putting wood on the altar daily to keep it burning, etc.?
Further say W[illiam] A[lexander] in same page, this exercise must be attended to by all sorts growths and experience in our individual capacities, at home in our families or about our lawful occasions. This inward exercises is attended with safety. The effects is righteousness and its reward is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. It is better to wear away than rust away, I often think.
[marginal note] Very warm weather as any this summer.
10. First Day. At our meeting. Pretty lively and satisfactory to me.
13. At our select quarterly meeting at Haddonfield. Forepart very dull, poor and low as I thought, and at last R. Jordan said he that it had been a low, dull time. But Henry Hull of the state of New York, one of our greatest ministers, was there and labored through all and had very extensive, excellent service, and it ended savory and satisfactory to me. I find it is so; if I can but answer my own conscience, I need fear no man, as Stephen Crisp says and another of more ancient date, the righteous are as bold as a lion <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 28:1</note>  .
[marginal note] Very warm indeed.
14. Quarterly meeting. Richard Jordan first and then Henry Hull had very great service, large and powerful. Both spoke against an easeful state as to religion and about the great scramble and scuffle after earthly treasures etc., which produces formality and a lethargic stupefaction as to religion. The weather was so hot and trying, I was overcome and could not sit meeting for business. I think it a great merry and a wonder – which it is to be feared is not enough considered – that that such a succession of lively, powerful gospel ministers should be continued to us as of old. Also, I set watchmen over you saying, hearken to the sound of the trumpet, etc. The people formerly were threatened with a famine of the word, etc., but they said we will not hearken <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 6:17</note>  . And what is the expressive language of conduct of many now? View and compare our present state with the state of our worthy predecessors, when the prisons were filled all over the nation, and as William Edmundson said their fare was very mean and lodging on straw, but the Lord was with them and made bread and water as satisfactory to them as the most delicious dainties and prisons and dungeons more pleasant than places without the Lord’s favor. We read the great master dined on barley bread and fish, and as William Penn say, not likely any great delicacy in cooking them and of those that lived in caves and dens of the earth, wandering in sheep skins and goatskins, having no certain dwelling place <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 11:37</note>   and of John, whose meat was locust and wild honey and a leather girdle about his loins <note resp="transcr">Matthew 3:4</note>  . These are they of whom it was said, the world was not worthy of them <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 11:38</note>  .
But let us take a view of our present state: riding to meeting in great state, like Parliament men with nice, fat, well matched horses, gilded harness, glittering chariots (jumping chariots as the prophet says <note resp="transcr">Nahum 3:2</note>  ), exceeding all the societies on earth. A great change indeed, from that of laying on straw and enduring many years imprisonment, when hundred died in prisons with suffering and hardship. The primitive Christians used to say prosperity was a very intoxicating thing and few brains were strong enough to bear it.
And Seneca says: prosperity, like a strong gale, presently carries us out of sight of peace. To see the road filled with carriages for miles together of the most shining delicate sort, shining like looking glasses, made me think of the words of the prophet: their land is full of silver and gold, there is no end to their treasures; their land also is full of horses, there is no end to their chariots. They worship the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:7-8</note>  , and is it not greatly to be feared that the hearts of many are too much taken up with and entangled and bemired with these conveniences? If we look back a few years we may see the advances in these things have been very rapid and very great, surpassing all the societies on earth or however I know not of any that exhibits such a show at our meetings and burials, etc. It is said some of their carriages cost three hundred dollars. If the expense were applied to the use of the poor, would it not be an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord? It robs the poor and does but please the wanton, as William Penn says.
<pb id="A0011526_080"/>
16th of the Ninth Month, 1815. Exceeding warm and dry and dusty. We went over Ancocas Creek to see our ancient sister Hannah Buzby and other relations. Lodged at Joseph Wills’. Catched in a heavy shower.
17. First Day. At Ancocas meeting and an open, owning, precious one it was to me, more so than I have seen lately. 
We dined with our cousin Sam Wills and then came to our son-in-law’s, Darling Conrow’s, to lodge. A rainy night clears up very cool.
[marginal note] It was thought the weather has not been warmer all summer.
Seventh Day. Going so hot, could hardly bear our clothes on. Now so cold, could hardly do without my great coat on.
[marginal note] A great rain after a spell of very hot, dry weather.
Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. A lively one to me, a little of that which casts out fear. By thee have I run through a troop and leaped over a wall, said David  <note resp="transcr">Psalm 18:29</note> . Now, says Robert Nesbitt, I feel as if you could not hurt me. If I can but answer my own conscience, I need fear no man, says Stephen Crisp. Cousin Hannah Yarnall of Byberry, Pennsylvania came to see us and told us two children near where she lives were killed with the thunder Seventh Day evening. The heavy black cloud was in full view before us; as we drew near the toll bridge, we seen the very sharp lightning. Another very heavy shower was behind us up in Evesham and violent hard thunder near Bourton’s mill. Two oak trees tore all to pieces with the thunder. One that seen them said he did not think the oldest man living could say they ever seen the like, they were so torn up root and branch. Are not these awful displays of Almighty power far surpassing human power?
We went with our cousin Hannah Yarnall and her son James to see our cousin, Hinchman Haines, where we had a satisfactory visit and a comfortable sitting with the children and family at last.
[marginal note] A very great cold storm.
24. First Day. At our meeting Hannah Drinker and her son, George Price, were there and both spoke and several others. Something pretty lively.
[marginal note] Sowing rye.
On Fourth Day Simon Gilum and Jeremiah Crossdill of Pennsylvania appointed a meeting at Moorestown. It was very large, a full meeting. Came off middling, to me it was a low time, could not stir. I dined at Samuel Church’s with the strangers, and divers neighbors were there, and we had an opportunity with their hopeful, innocent children and family; for the better, it seemed to me to be.
Sixth Day. My daughter Hannah and I went to Cropwell, to a meeting appointed by Simon Gilum, which I thought was but small and but dull. Yet Simon and Hinchman Haines had very acceptable service; it was with me like some formerly. Whist I was making ready another stepped in, etc. This afternoon I heard Israel Middletown, a healthy young man, son of N.M., was to be buried at Moorestown and had lived near there. He was at meeting last First Day as well as usual, was taken very ill as he was at work in the field with the bilious colic on Second Day and died on Fifth Day. He lived with his father and it’s like had the chief care of the farm. Oh, what solemn awful call to the young, stout, and strong! But strange and sorrowful to see what little effect or impressions it makes – seems they seem soon forgotten although the repeated calls of mortality.

1 of Tenth Month. First Day. My friend Samuel Church took me in his chair up to Upper Evesham meeting, where they have lately built a very large, famous meeting house and it was almost filled and through continued mercy it was an open, owning, satisfactory time to me and there was tokens of its being so to many others. The love, feeling nearness, and pleasantness after meeting was such that I never seen the like there before. Went to Joshua Stokes’s to dine, where I left in his care some things I had collected for a very poor widow and her children up in The Pines where I had a meeting some months ago.
[marginal note] It is wonderful to see the increase of peoples. In my time, when they kept meeting in an old log schoolhouse, a desolate remote corner it then seemed to be.

5 of the Tenth Month, 1815. At our Monthly Meeting a number of strangers some from Philadelphia and some from Haddonfield: Sarah Cresson, Deborah Stuart, Thomas Mathews of Philadelphia and others. I thought something savory and lively attended the meeting throughout and satisfactory to me. This day heard of the death of Thomas Lawrey of Piles Grove, a minister in very good esteem, not very far advanced in years but left a number of children, a choice, sweet-spirited man. I was very intimately acquainted with him have been very kindly entertained at his house and he with us here not very long ago. He visited the meetings here about and paid us a very kind, acceptable visit. Another grievous account – James Frinch, his wife got disordered in her mind or somewhat deranged and he gone to the Ohio to see his relations there. She has been disordered in mind some before they say and it is said sickness much prevails towards Salem and Piles Grove. Several deaths of late, it is thought, seemed occasioned by a bilious or typhus or nervous fever. I believe the doctors hardly know what to call them. Divers very uncommon strange disorders of latter years; some have lost their senses, some their rearing and I think some their sight.
[marginal note] Dry weather.
[marginal note] Dry.
8. First Day I had a meeting at the Burlington County poor house. About  paupers, they say. There some had lost one leg, some, one hand, and a number had lost their sight, quite blind, some very silly, and some almost blind, and many lost their hearing. Thomas Lippincott and his wife and Samuel Church went with me. We met with an open reception; although the steward and his wife inclined to join the Methodists, they were very kind to us and I believe the meeting was to general satisfaction. Lidia Lippincott, I thought, was evidently owned and favored. I have had this visit in view several months past and have waited for suitable company, was glad I was there. I seen some of my old acquaintance had got there whom I have not seen since we were apprentices together at Moorestown and playmates. One of these said several times he never was more glad to see anybody in his life. Some were tendered, I believe, to tears in meeting. Many of them are reduced to poverty by drinking to excess. Several poor women with sucking babes in their arms; and several black people. They at parting expressed thankfulness for our noticing them and for our visit – divers after their way desiring the Lord might bless us. Although it is about twenty miles, I got well home in the evening.
[marginal note] Dry weather.
[marginal note] A fine shower.
10. On Second Day met with a close trial; my black hired man for a small offence run off and left me in the most busy season, when getting in buckwheat, potatoes, sowing wheat, etc. Oh, what trials and cross occurrences in this world and sometimes dismal clouds of confusion arise from very small matters. Behold, said one of old, what a great matter a little fire kindleth <note resp="transcr">James 3:5</note>  . What slippery places we stand in and walk in what need of continual watchfulness and prayer for preservation from evil! This the prophet experienced when he said, my steps had well nigh slept – see Psalms 73:2. The cloud went off, the man returned to his business and we got in our buckwheat and most of our potatoes. It caused me to think and consider how many we read of in Scripture and down to this day who have slipped and grievously fell from small cases – not only individuals, but whole nations. As Peter Charron and William Penn  remarks, whole nations have been thrown into dismal wars, desolation, destruction, and ruin from very small causes, very small indeed: as the not striking a flag or the not saluting a garrison, to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives. And all this for want of true religion, as that great warrior Washington now so much extolled amongst Americans. He says, of all the dispositions and habits which lead to the prosperity of a nation, says Washington, religion is the indispensable support; volumes could not trace all its connections with private and public happiness. I unite with his sentences in praise of religion, but not with his conduct as a warrior.
[marginal note] Oh, the private malice and even duels from trifling causes to loss of lives.
I ask not for gold for Spartans, said Lycurgus, virtue is better than all gold and as we read in Scripture, wisdom is better than weapons of war <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 9:18</note>  , etc.
Fifth Day. At our meeting Elizabeth Kirling and Sarah Pope of Burlington County had good service, and some thought it a good meeting.
<pb id="A0011526_082"/>
15th Tenth Month, 1815. First Day. At our meeting Sarah King and Mary Stevenson of Springfield had acceptable service. I thought something owning and lively attended the meeting. I have nothing very material to remark of late – very busy getting our corn sowing, etc. Only some of our meetings of late have been very low and poor and some more lively and satisfactory.
29 of the Tenth Month. I was at Westfield meeting, which was as open and satisfactory as any I remember there. Dined at Thomas Lippincott’s.
[marginal note] Our sister Hannah Buzby here a week. Took her to Bernie Warrington’s.
Third Day. Thomas Davis of Piles Grove appointed a meeting at our meeting. A hopeful, improving young minister.
{1815-11}
Fifth Day. At our meeting, lively and satisfactory, owning and strengthening. Favored to get along with our falls work beyond expectation.
5 of the Eleventh Month. First Day. At our meeting. Seldom, if ever, seen a more open, owning time. I had cause to remember Thomas Ross’s remark, when under sail with fair wind and tide the danger of missing the right landing place. Several were afraid I stood rather too long, but one of them said it ended well, so all is well that ends well. But then how needful for them that think they stand to heed, least they fall and again, as Thomas Ross says, the hardest thing ever he found in his life when he was right to keep so <note resp="transcr">Thomas Wagstaffe, <italic>Piety Promoted</italic>, vol. 9.</note>  . So I find it; prosperity of any sort, either temporal or spiritual, is a very intoxicating thing, as the primitive Christians used to say, and few brains were strong enough to bear it. John Churchman says, knowing the treachery of self he did not desire to be entrusted with much and John Crook said he begged that he might be kept poor. Then, says he, I shall speak from thee and for thee <note resp="transcr">John Crook, 1617-1699, <italic>A short history of the life</italic></note>  . Like Mordecai and Daniel after times of favor returned and say at the king’s gate, blessed is the man found watching at wisdom’s gate and waiting at the posts of her door, and as David says, blessed is the man that feareth always, etc. <note resp="transcr">Psalms 112:1</note>  . Happy for me if it was so with me.
9. Was our Monthly Meeting. Hinchman Haines had extensive service and it seemed to be pretty lively throughout.
12. First Day. I was at Cropwell. Came off middling things, but low. We hear that in Maryland, Virginia, and several other places towards Salem their Indian corn is cut off with the drought and that there was lately a most violent wind eastward, which damaged the vessels very much. Our crops of Indian corn and buckwheat hereaway very good, although a very dry time latter part of summer.
16. At our meeting. A very stormy day. meeting very small, but it was a precious one to me. The savor was pleasant to remember several days and nights. The dew of Hermon that descended on the mountains of Sion, the shadow of a great rock in a weary land <note resp="transcr">Psalms 133:3</note>  . The ointment of his right hand betrayeth itself etc. <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:16</note>  . The inspiration that giveth understanding, the sincere milk of the word, the breast of consolation <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 66:11</note>  , etc., etc., etc. The oil of joy and garment of praise <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 61:3</note>   for or instead of the spirit of heaviness, which nowadays much attack us.
We hear that a disorder is very prevalent in Philadelphia and New York, like a bad cold called the influenza, of which some die very suddenly they say, choke with the phlegm and further accounts of the dreadful wind or hurricane in New England tearing down houses and all before it.
[marginal note] Fine weather
19. First Day. At our meeting almost silent, water very low, as I thought. Dare not venture. Joseph Justice, who has lately been traveling in Pennsylvania, told me this disorder much prevails in York County and thereaway.
[marginal note] Moderate
21. See William Penn’s <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>, page 281, the words of Hipparchia: for true satisfaction, thou knowest, is in the mind and that pleasure is only worth seeking that lasts forever. The prophet David prayed that thee might be guided in the way everlasting [Psalm 139:24]. O, the wisdom there is in it and the emptiness and folly in all other ways! Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it <note resp="transcr">Matthew 7:14</note>  . More in the pity at our preparative meeting last Fifth Day: a shut up, poor time. I was very poorly.
[marginal note] 21. Eleventh Month. See Isaac Penington’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 672: ye may as well make a man without the nature of a man as a Christian without the nature of a Christian.
<pb id="A0011526_083"/>
Seventh Day, 25th of the Eleventh Month, 1815. Heard of the death of Rebeckah Roberts, who died in the 96th year of her age. We paid her a visit a few weeks ago; she could converse on religious subjects sensibly. She was an approved, acceptable minister and left a good savor. Her husband has been dead about twenty years. Oh, how a little time sweeps off one generation after another! She was about twenty years older than myself. I have been very poorly some time with the prevailing disorder called the influenza; it seems like a bad cold in the head and stomach. From accounts it is a general complaint through the country and cities, of which some have died very suddenly, choke, they say, with the phlegm.
[marginal note] Weather very fine and moderate. I, poorly, confined to the house.
I am told a young man near Haddonfield died with the lock-jaw by running a nail in his foot and of an alarm about mad dogs and that several people were bit with them about or towards Gloucester. Sword, pestilence, and noisome beasts <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 4:21</note>   we read of. I have been very poorly some time; not able to get out to meeting.
[marginal note] Several spells of cold weather.
{1815-12}
2 of the Twelfth Month, 1815. Heard of the death of Hannah Buzby, formerly Stokes. Died with the dropsy. We called to see her some weeks ago. She was an old acquaintance and a little older, I think, than I am.
[marginal note] Changeable weather
7. Was Monthly Meeting. Very stormy, I not able to go out. See Richard Claridge’s work, page 66: And still this word of heavenly council is with me – wait, wait, etc. There is life and safety in waiting in the stillness, for when the natural man or fleshy part is silenced, then is the season for God to work and as dear Mary Gulson said to me and I have experienced, when we are got into the true stillness the enemy cannot come to hurt for he hath nothing to work upon when the flesh is silent. Is it not then the time for the good remembrancer to bring into our minds the most interesting, profitable things? Is not this state of safety in the silence of all flesh the state of Israel abiding in their tents, where no enchantments could prevail against them? Is it not the state David so earnestly desired when he said, oh, send out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me and let them teach me and bring me to thy holy hill and to thy tabernacle <note resp="transcr">Psalms 43:5-4</note> ? Are not these things a mystery hid from ages and nations, are they not a mystery to thousands that frequently and constantly attend silent meetings? And is it not the more excellent way the apostle spoke <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 12:31</note>  of? Can it be possible there can be a more excellent way? Is it not the way everlasting or that will last forever when all other ways fail? Are not those who are fixed and settled in this state of true stillness, in the silence of all flesh, settled on that rock against which the gates of Hell can never prevail? And is not this all that is wanting to attain to a state wherein we can truly say, thy will be done? For is it not so as that worthy minister Joseph White said I never found that when I well did predominate in me that I ever stood rightly situated for to receive divine instruction? Is it not very likely that thousands and hundreds of thousands are constantly saying and respecting this, thy kingdom come, thy will be done etc., and still yet continue to do their own wills and so never come into a state and situation suitable to receive divine instruction? Is not this the promise, they that do my will shall know of my doctrine <note resp="transcr">John 7:17</note>  ? But for want of this, how few ever come to reap the benefit of the Scriptures as the faithful in ages past have done, although many seem to value them highly. Stand still and see the salvation of God, was the language to Israel formerly in a great strait. Look unto me all the ends of the earth and be ye saved <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 45:22</note>  , said the great Master. Only to think how people any brought to this at last when every other way fails them then the cry is a saviour or I die, a redeemer or I perish etc., who shall deliver me etc.?
[marginal note] Stormy. On the whole, a very fine moderate fall. No snow yet 9 or 10 of Twelfth Month.
[marginal note] This influenza disorder generally prevalent.
Last First Day 10 I went to our meeting, although but poorly. With me the waters low, and so I kept silent although considerable matter opened to view. Ann Edwards did worthily. I hear Joshua Dudley a few days ago was struck with a shock of the palsy. He has been a very hard working man, raised ten children, has been a very constant attender of meeting many years and I hope improved some.
And Joseph Hewlings, I hear, is very ill, not likely to live. An exceeding working, ingenious, thriving man. Now to think how suddenly these two have been snatched out of the cumbers of the world with numbers of others.
14 our quarterly meeting I not able to go to it. Our children and others say it was a favored, good meeting. Henry Hull and Richard Jordan both had very pertinent, extensive service. What an unmerited favor yet continued to an ungrateful, lukewarm, backsliding people.
<pb id="A0011526_084"/>
21st of the Twelfth Month, 1815. First Day. I got out to our meeting, and a precious one it was to me: open, owning, comforting, strengthening, and uniting, for all seemed right and pleasant after meeting. Oh, that we could so live as to know and have an increase of this! So run that ye may obtain was the subject. Our son John and his worthy wife and four children charming and beautiful were here this afternoon to see us.
[marginal note] Weather moderate.
4th 24th Killing hogs and [illegible]
25. At our meeting preparative. First part satisfactory, latter not so much so. The meeting was very small, yet on the whole something lively and savory.
See newspaper <italic>Trenton Federalist</italic>, October 2, 1815, No 866: Boston, September 25 is an account of a very destructive storm, the like not known since the settlement of the country. After a long account of the dreadful destruction of this storm they say at last: but the most calamitous part remains yet to be mentioned. We have to lament (besides those wounded and maimed) the death of some industrious, valuable citizens – some carried with their houses into the water and others crushed to death between the planks and the vessels as they dashed through the bridge. How many lives were lost or how much property destroyed is not yet ascertained. Since the inundation subsided, the military have been constantly on duty to prevent the pillage of the remaining property which was exposed. New London, Stonington and Gratton in Connecticut suffered severely by the above storm. Further eastward the wind was not so violent. This storm was an awful display of Almighty power, no doubt an awful, terrifying time like the land of Median [Midian] and the tents of Cushan. The prophet said, I saw the tents of Cushan in great affliction and the curtains of the land of Median [Midian] did tremble <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:7</note>  . Many a city and country have been brought into a state of terror and trembling by divers ways and divers means. An awful, solemn call and visitation. See Isaiah 29 and 6 verse: thou shalt be visited with a storm; and Nahum 1:3 verse: the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and storm; Mark 4 and 37 there arose a great storm; Psalms 107:25 he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind; 148:8 snow, and vapor; stormy wind fulfilling his word; Ezekiel 13:11 hail stones shall fall, stormy wind shall rend; and 13 I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; Psalms 107:29 he maketh the storm a calm, the waves are still; Isaiah 4:6 and for a covert from storm and from rain; and 25:4 for thou hast been a refuge from the storm. See Psalms 55:6-8: oh, that I had wings like a dove (the wings of faith, of hope, and of love), I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest and 83:15 and make them afraid with thy storm. See Matthew 7 and 24: therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man that built his house upon a rock; 25 and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock, etc.; 26-7: and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man that built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it. See Job 1:19: and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead, etc. A poor black man drowned crossing the creek on ice at timber creek.
[marginal note] We have had no snow till now, 24 of the Twelfth Month. A large snow, cold winter weather. 
24. First Day. At our meeting. Middling cold weather. I pretty much confined.
28. Fifth Day. At our meeting come off pretty well. Something pretty lively, though small.
31. First Day. At our meeting. Came off without condemnation.
[marginal note] Storm and snow.
{1816-01}
4 of the First Month 1816. At our Monthly Meeting. Nathan Yarnal of Philadelphia was there and had very acceptable service: savor, weight, and evidence attended. See Richard Claridge’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 455: provided we do what we can on our part, God will not be wanting on his, but I nowhere find that God hath promised to force happiness on the negligent and a reward upon the wicked and slothful servant. A gift may be given for nothing, but surely a reward does in the very nature of it always suppose service. None but a righteous man is capable of receiving a righteous man’s reward. As St. John says, he that doth righteous is righteous, etc <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:7</note>  .

4th of the First Month 1816. My neighbor, John Haines, just returned from Miami – a journey of about six hundred miles westward – tells me that this influenza disorder prevails very much all through the country and that abundance of people are moving from the eastward still further to the westward, below Kentucky, 200 miles beyond the Miami, eight or nine hundred miles, and that it has been a very sickly mortal time with them and very many have died with a kind of a fever. Is it not remarkable how great sickness and mortality prevails on our continent as far as we can hear from east to west? A black man froze to death near Haddonfield. He had been helping kill hogs and perhaps drinked too much.
[marginal note] Great snow on the ground.
7 of the First Month. First Day. At our meeting. To me pretty satisfactory.
9. Elizabeth Kerling and Sarah Pope (of Mansfield) were here visiting families, choice honest ministers. Richard Lawrance from home with them, and Thomas Lippincott accompanied them.
11. Fifth Day. At our meeting. The above named women – E.K. and S.P. – were there, and Benjamin Stiles and Martha Matlack were married. Sarah Pope had acceptable service, although a time of lowness as to the life and power of truth, yet it ended something savory.
It is said three were struck with a shock of the palsey in one day, 25 Eleventh Month, 1815: Joshua Dudley, John Shin, and Samuel Stokes. Dudley has been very much disabled, but some better. The others also got much better. We hear that six were drownded on the river a skating and twelve down the river by their boat or vessel getting aground. A printed paper says four were drowned lately in Bottom Bay; they were overset in a thunder shower sailing First Day in a party pleasure.
[marginal note] Very cold, severe frost.
[marginal note] Great snow again.
1816, 14 of the First Month. First Day and very stormy, a great snow. Almost all our family unwell with bad colds and not able to go to meeting. See Richard Claridge’s <italic>Works, </italic>page 574, Some passages transcribed out of his commonplace book. This is the conclusion of his book, and as he thought these passages worthy of preserving in his commonplace book, why may not I also, viz.: there are two different states of men. One is where sin prevails. In the other, religion and goodness takes palce [place?]. These two differ in degrees as wide as Heaven and Hell, which places we must not believe to be all hereafter. For both the one and the other are in some measure begun here on Earth. They that are made like unto God in the frame and temper of their minds, who live according to the everlasting and unchangeable rules of goodness, righteousness, and truth may be properly said to have made their entrance already into Heaven. But they who confound the difference of good and evil, who care not to approve themselves to God by leading good and Holy lives do partake of the diabolical nature and are already entered into the state of Hell.
[marginal note] See four leaves back, more quotations from R.C. works.
John Hartcliffe’s <italic>Treaties of Moral and Intellectual Virtues</italic>, Edition 1691, Preface page 25-26: The first thing in religion is to refine a man’s temper and the second is to govern his practice; for if it do not mend men’s spirits and regulate their lives, it is much inferior to any principle in nature which is sufficient to and doth attain its effect. But the grace of God suspended to the reason of our minds is of strength sufficient to subdue all the temptations to evil. Ibid, preface, p. 26: the Scripture doth everywhere speak of moral virtue as the foundation of all revealed and instituted religion, and therefore our saviour, when he was asked which was the first and great commandment of the law, answers: thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself <note resp="transcr">Matthew 22:38-40</note>  . A Jew would have thought that he would have pitched upon some of these things which were in so great esteem among them: sacrifices, circumcision, or the Sabbath – but he overlooks all these and instances in the two principal duties of morality: the love of God and our neighbor. And these moral duties are those he calls the law and the prophets and which he came not to destroy but to fulfill, for the judicial and ceremonial law of the Jews was to be perpetual and immutable, which whosoever neglects, he can never please God with any [illegible]

Instituted or positive part of religion. And throughout the Old Testament nothing is declared more abominable to him than sacrifice as long as men allowed themselves in wicked practices. And in the New Testament the Christian religion chiefly designs to teach mankind righteousness, godliness and sobriety. And for this end was the glorious appearance of the great God and our saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works, ibid., page 408-409.
[marginal note] I seldom knew a greater snow and very freezing cold.
In the description of the day of judgment, men are represented by our Savior as called to an account both as to the practice and neglect of moral duties and no others are instanced in to shew what place he intended they should have in his religion. All positive institutions must give way to moral duties because God hath declared that he would rather have mercy than sacrifice. And whosoever violates any natural law, he undermines the very foundation of religion, Ibid p. 410. Piety towards God, righteousness, justice, and charity towards men are more pleasing to God and more valuable than if he should offer to him all the beasts of the forests or the cattle upon a thousand hills. For to the first observance of these duties we are directed and obliged by our very nature and the most sacred laws which God hath written upon our hearts. And that we might have no pretence to take us off from them, God hath freed us in the Gospel from those many observances and burdensome ceremonies where with the religion of the Jews was encumbered that we might better mind moral duties and live in the practice of them, Ibid. pp. 411-412.
See George Dillwyn’s <italic>Reflections</italic>, page 25. He says useless studies are a busy idleness. And see [Lindley Murray’s]<italic>Power of Religion on the Mind, </italic>page 42 and 44: Solmacius, a man of uncommon abilities, when he arrived at the evening of life and had to reflect on the work of his day, he acknowledged he had mistaken true learning and that in which solid happiness consisted and exclaimed thus against himself: oh, I have lost a world of time, that most precious thing in the world! Oh, said he to those about him, mind the world less and God more. The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom and to depart from evil is good understanding and see same book, <italic>Power of Religion on the Mind</italic>, page 39 and 40, concerning that great man Hugh Grotius: to one that admired his great industry, he returned an answer to this effect: ah, I have consumed much of my life in laborious doing nothing! And to another that inquired of his wisdom and learning what course to take, he solemnly answered: be serious. Now if useless studies and useless labors are a busy idleness, what abundance of idleness and loss of precious time there is! The Scriptures say work whilst it is called to day, lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven etc. <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:20</note>   and to see the scramble, as Richard Jordan said the other day, after the things of this world, after earthly treasure – hardly a stone left unturned. What voyages they will make, what journeys they will take to procure independent estates to the hazard of health and life and some shorten their days in their career and scramble and so die martyrs for money. Some last words of T. H., a man I knew who had a plentiful estate and careful in my dealings amongst man and to pay every man his due; but as to the great work of my souls salvation, I have not done so much as the moving the least grain of sand. And indeed so it seems to be: they that seems most in earnest to lay up treasure on earth seem least concerned and most unconcerned and stupid about laying up treasures in Heaven and without which all their labor is at last a useless, busy, idleness. As Solomon says, all is vanity and vexation of spirit <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 1:2 </note>  . Then at last ten thousand of worlds for peace with the Lord.

17th of the First Month 1816 We have had very cold weather several weeks and great snow, but this days swept away [corner of page missing] We may remember the words of Christ to Martha and Mary: Martha, Martha thou art careful about many things; one thing is needful <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:41-42</note>  , and what is this one thing needful but the mercy and favor of God’s? They that seek that first (as we are commanded) seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness and all things needful shall be added. So they that obtain this obtain all they need and they that neglect and miss of obtaining this one thing needful, they loose all, and all their studies are but a busy idleness and they consume their time in laborious doing of nothing.
But if useless studies are a busy idleness, certainly useful studies are a very profitable exercise. For the apostle recommends it, and commands it: study to shew thyself approved in the sight of God <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 2:15</note>  . And they were and are pronounced blessed whose meditations were in the law of the Lord day and night. But we read of the doom of the idle, slothful servant, and Solomon says, how long will thou sleep, oh, sluggard, how long will it be ere thou awake out of sleep? Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth and thy want as an armed man <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 6:9-11</note>   useless studies unprofitable thoughts. As William Shewin <note resp="transcr"><italic>Counsel to the Christian Traveler</italic></note>   says, vain unprofitable thoughts are great troublers of the world. David says I hate vain thoughts but thy law do I love <note resp="transcr">Psalm 119:113</note>  , and Paul says he had something to do to put away unprofitable thoughts and the prophet says, wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 4:14</note>  ? And again says another, as I walked by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding, so it was all grown over with thorns, etc. I saw and considered it well; I looked upon it and received instruction <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 24:30-31</note>  . But I believe this spiritual idleness, this useless study, this laborious doing of nothing is far the worst of the two sorts of idleness and most fatal. Although there are too many who are so lazy, idle, careless, and trifling as not to take care for even their poor bodies and became a burden to their fellow creatures. These are, and have been in ages and nations past, abhorred amongst the generality of their fellow creatures, so that some have said if the devil finds a man idle, he will set him to work. Idleness is the mother of mischief and again, according to Charron, the Spaniards used to say, all men are tempted of the Devil, but an idle man really tempts the Devil.
[marginal note] Snow swept away very suddenly or a great part of it.

See Stephen Crisp’s <italic>Sermons</italic>, page 107: are there not some here and there that are settled in a belief of the truth but are got into an ease from the labor of the truth and then mentions the possibility of a firm belief of the truth and having fellowship with and communion with them that preach and them that believe. But, my friends, all this will not give you communion with God, though there is communion with the Church of God, with respect to men who are come into one faith and doctrines and beyond all words and expressions; therefore your business and mine and every one’s is what we undertook when our faces were first turned towards God that we might be followers of God in the regeneration. Oh, how great and high is our profession and especially in that of silent worship (as he says) beyond all doctrines, beyond all words and expressions. Again see Stephen Crisp’s <italic>Sermons</italic>, page 370: the way for people to come to receive divine knowledge is by thinking, by meditating, by considering of that converse that God hath with their own souls. For there is a way provided for all men to converse with God that made them; every man and woman may ask questions of him and may have answers from him, if they have patience enough to wait for them. Every soul here present that with seriousness of mind shall ask of God what their state and condition is if they were to die presently, God will tell them. He will answer them by the light of his son Jesus Christ and let them know whether they are in the gall of bitterness or and in the bonds of their iniquity still or whether they are redeemed out of it, etc. And does not the apostle say, if any man lack wisdom let him ask it of God who gives liberally and upbraids none <note resp="transcr">James 1:5</note>  ?

21 of the First Month. First Day I got to our meeting again – a pretty lively, open, owning, satisfactory one to me. This afternoon Rebeckah Hubbs, my cousin from Piles Grove, appointed a meeting at Moorestown which was large and at forepart very poor and low, I thought; but it growed better and ended pretty well. R.H. expressed something of an apprehension that the people of that place would be visited with sickness or afflictions or to that effect.
Oh, how beautiful a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity, compared to the dew of Hermon that descended on the mountains of Sion where the Lord commanded the blessing life forever more . <note resp="transcr">Psalm 133:3</note>

28th of the First Month, 1816. First Day I am so poorly. I am confined to the house with a second attack of the influenza, now very prevalent through the country. I heard of the death of Arthur Howel of Philadelphia, a stout, corpulent, healthy man he has been most of his days. About my age, a minister in very good esteem. It is said his illness was but short; typhus fever, some says. He with Joseph Clerk were here to see me in my sickness six or seven years ago. He spoke comfortably to me and now he is gone and Joseph Clerk has lost his eyesight and is, it is said, quite blind. How remarkably Philadelphia is striped of all their elderly Friends who were a few years ago were as their chief standard bearers. 
[marginal note] Snow again, but clears up moderate.
{1816-02}
1 of the Second Month Fifth Day I am not yet able to go out.
[marginal note] Moderate.
See Richard Claridge's <italic>Works, </italic>page 389, Essay on the Trinity. He quotes an article of the Church of England (which I have seen quoted in divers other authors), expression of their belief of the necessity of inspiration, as works done before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of the spirit are not pleasing to God for as much as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ art 13.
I heard of the sudden death of Martha Evans, wife of John Evans, an old acquaintance near my age, daughter of William and Hannah Forster, in about three days illness with the colic or typhus complaint, out of her senses most of the time of her illness, upwards of seventy; and of John Wilson on the other side of us about four miles of each of them from us. He has been a very hard drinker, but better of it of latter years. He had been threshing all day till near night, stepped out in the barnyard and fell down and died instantly. Perhaps about sixty.
First Day. At our meeting, though hardly fit or able to go (a poor time I believe). The waters so low I dare not venture. A suffering, mortifying time to me.
9. Monthly Meeting. Very cold. I, very poorly, not able to get out. They tell me Nathan Smith was there and had very acceptable service. He has been lately much shut up and almost overwhelmed with trouble with his children, but seem like to float again. This day a young man from near the New Mills or county poor house came here to beg relief. He told me that a few weeks ago his house was burnt and two children (which was all he had) was burnt in it and a considerable sum of money, several hundred dollars. He and his wife went to see a sick neighbor very near, put their children to sleep and put wood in the stove, and it was thought it took fire from the stove pipe which went up through the floor. I could mention several other instances of several houses being burnt and several children burnt in them. A few years ago one near Toll Bridge three children burnt in and one at Timber Creek and several burnt to death in it.
11. First Day. Weather some more moderate. I got to our meeting and an open, strengthening, satisfactory one it was to me and to general satisfaction, as far as I could see. An invitation was given to the burial of John Haines of Moorestown.
[marginal note] Rain, stormy.
15. Weather very cold. I dare not venture out, being poorly Fifth Day.
Yesterday my beloved friend Nathan Smith came to see us with William Evans and wife, and a pleasant social visit it was and at last had a little religious opportunity to profit, I hope.
18. I got to our meeting, which I thought was very poor and low forepart, but it growed better. Several of us had something to say, and life and savor did increase and it ended very lively and savory, I believe. A strengthening time to me.
[marginal note] Clears up very fine and warm.
[marginal note] Rainy again.
21. I went to the burial of our neighbor, Joseph Hewlings, a very working, capable man in worldly business in the midst of his days and pursued it with great eagerness. There was a great number of people who behaved very soberly, and I had a very open, satisfactory time with them. People were very courteous and respectful at parting. He died with the dropsy, brought on it was thought by getting in a great heat mowing hay and then drinking cold water.
Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting and a precious, open, lively, owing time it was throughout. As our elders expressed it, what a favor continued to an unworthy people. We heard of the death of Samuel Roberts, Jr., a young man married a few weeks ago. Exposed himself very much in the cold and was taken, as it is said, with the typhus fever. Very much out of his senses, lay about a week and at the same time heard of the death of Kendal Coles, son of Job. A hard drinker, left a young [indecipherable]

Sitting by my fire this evening I was brought into a state of reflection about a small visit I performed in the neighborhood of North Wales in the State of Pennsylvania and thinking some of my kind young friends in that place would like to know how I come to do it and advantage I thought to receive by it and not knowing but an account of it writing would be of use to them I thought I would just sit down and relate the as near as my recollection would serve all the occurrences that was pleasing and those that were not. I left home on Second Day in the morning went I Rowland's in order to get some necessary things that should want while I was on the visit but being detained there three or four hours longer than I expected did not get to Josiah Roberts house till they had just done dinner Josiah's wife Mary informed me that Jos[indecipherable] had gone in his chair to

After taking dinner at Josiah I walked to uncle Joseph Matlack's enquiring if Josiah had come. My cousin informed me that Henry Warrington Jr. had taken the pains to assist them in getting to the river and making no stay walked on till I met Henry returning back in the chair who seemed a little surprised at seeing me come so late. I told him the reason, asking him if he thought I might cross the river handy and after a little more conversation with him
<pb id="A0011527_004"/>
I told him I had come to this conclusion: if when I come to the river and there was so much ice or it was so much I could not get across I would just turn about and go home and be content, he told me I must not be discouraged to but if it so happened that I did not cross come back to his house and he would take me early next morning in time to the river that I might get to Byberry Meeting. I signified to him I would go to the river and wait for and opportunity to cross and if should fall out that I got over safe then I would look upon it as a good sign for me to think I was going [last word indecipherable]so biding him farewell
When I got to the river the ferryman said I was a lucky man to come just in the right time for good crossing.
I asked if he thought there was any such thing as luck. Getting into the boat we had a long discourse on what luck was when I reached Pennsylvania shore I gave him 25 cents for my ferriage bidding him farewell.
From here I walk up to Byberry and staid all night at my father-in-law's, not going to bed until I had inform them how I had crossed the river

The meeting then adjourned till 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

19 of the month and Third of the week, Friends again assembled pump and to adjournment.
Samuel Smith spoke a few words as the opening of this sitting the meeting then proceeded to the queries and answers. After the 1st query was read and answers from the several quarters to the same some very good remarks were made to the deficiencies that appeared in our members by the answer by William Flanner, Jesse Kersey and several other Friends. Kersey observed that if parents were rightly concerned for themselves other souls being made alive in truth that children would be benefited by observing that was the case with the father whose soul and that of his on would come to be bound in one and the same communion.

2nd query and answer thereto being read, Christopher Healy was engage to make an observation on this and the former one.

3rd query was read and its answer. John Baldwin very lovingly recommended a strict adherence to primitive plainness.

4th query and its answers were read,

Leaving home first day morning the 17th of 4th Month 1814 at 6 o'clock walked to William Copper's ferry landed at Ann Street ferry and proceed to Joseph Stokes' near the North Meeting house, where I attended meeting, beginning at the 10th hour, also at 4 o'clock afternoon.

18th of the month and Second of the week. After about ten minutes spent in solemn silence the introductory minute was read- the representatives from each of the quarterly meetings were called and they answered; some few sent reasons for their not being present.
It was then proposed for Friends who had certificates to produce them to the meeting early which being done. They were next read epistles from all the yearly meetings with which this [yearly meeting] usually corresponds were produced and read much satisfaction and a large committee appointed to make and prepare replies to each of them. The representatives were desired to propose to the meeting a suitable person for clerk and one to assist him. Meeting adjourned till 3 o'clock in the afternoon at which time Friends again assembled. Thomas Scattergood on behalf of the representatives proposed John Cox for Clerk and Samuel Beddle to assist him which the meeting concurred with and they were accordingly appointed for this year. The minutes of last year was read over and such parts of them as needed to be considered was done. Next the minutes from the Meeting for Sufferings were read over.

George Dillwyn said that communication was very helpful to build each other up in the most holy faith hope he might not when he went up to the house of the Lord he might not offer the sacrifice of fools. Richard Mott next after said if every individual was to endeavor to keep a steady mind wish desires to be acquainted with that which was good we might have a well grounded hope of his refreshing presence being sensible felt among us.

1817, 18 of Seventh Month. Harvest two or three weeks later than formerly. Reaping – had eleven hands, and with very hard scrabbling they cut it all down about fourteen acres and on the whole very good.
19. We got about two-thirds of it in. A smart shower catched some.
20. First Day. At our meeting. A very poor, low shut up time. Almost completely overwhelmed with ease, dullness, and indifferency. Hardly deserved the name of a meeting. I pitied the sincere seekers. Getting in our harvest and hay. Weather showery, but we scrabbled and got along very well. Our barn never better filled with grain and choice, good hay.
24. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Very small, people very busy getting in grain and hay. Weather rainy, but yet I believe harvest is generally got in. Our meeting, though low and poor, I thought not destitute of some savor of life and ownings of truth. Came off without condemnation. I have read an account that the persecutors of our first Friends said of them that they would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground, but they lived and attended their meetings so as to make it answer a good purpose. They pleased the Lord and obtained his favor, and that was enough and far transcended all this world could afford. But they did not tend their meetings in a poor, dry, formal way, nor were they overwhelmed with a spirit of ease and dullness.
28. First Day. At our meeting. I thought it a very poor, low time, but I don’t know, for I was so unwell I could hardly sit meeting. William Ashby of Philadelphia came to see me Seventh Day night and will at meeting and had acceptable service and Ebenezer Roberts, also my wife and children, and William Ashby went to a meeting at four at the schoolhouse near the Green Tree Tavern and they say they had a very open, good meeting. Hinchman Hain appointed it and was very large among a people who seldom tend any sort of meeting. I have been twelve months trying to open a door amongst them, and now I hope it will be occupied. This is the 2nd meeting with them. Very busy getting hay and favored to get along, though it goes very hard with me.
[marginal note] I so poorly I could not go with them.
{1817-08}
Fifth Day. At our meeting I thought to me more lively, open and satisfactory than common. By thee, said David, have I run through a troop and leaped over a wall <note resp="transcr">Psalm 18:29</note>  . We have many troops to encounter and walls of opposition.
<pb id="A0011529_002"/>
3 of the Eighth Month, 1817. First Day. At our meeting. Edward Hicks of Newtown, Pennsylvania, was there (the meeting large) and Edward had very great deal to say. Stood, I reckon, more than an hour. A great and powerful preacher, but, oh, the dullness of many hearers! Not as it was at the preaching of Peter, where several thousands were converted at one time and as it was in the days of George Fox, when great numbers were convinced at one meeting and when tenderness and brokenness of heart prevailed so that the tears often trickled down their cheeks and sometime, it is said, the floor was sprinkled with tears like to a sprinkling of rain. However, I thought I seen a tear, which is a great rarity now a days – under the greatest and most powerful preachers we have many frequently sit nodding.
4. On Second Day Edward Hicks had a meeting at Lower Evesham and had a great deal to say. Stood, I suppose, more than a hour.
5. Third Day. I went to see an old man and his wife several miles beyond Upper Evesham, found her in a very afflicted condition with the rheumatism. Then down to Upper Evesham meeting. Edward Hicks had a great deal to say, and I thought it ended sweet and savory. Then I went to see Job Chambers, who a few days ago had a loaded wagon with hay run over him – and his life has been much despaired of – but is getting better and to see Susannah Balinger, in a very languishing condition and very low and poor. Then called to see William Glover, afflicted greatly with a rheumatic complaint, a young man with a family.
6. Fourth Day I was at Cropwell with Edward Hicks. He generally stands more than an hour and is very searching. This afternoon at 4th hour we had a meeting at a schoolhouse near the green tree tavern. Edward was very large there also. Then he and his companion Steven Comfort came home with me to lodge.
7. On Fifth Day we were at our Monthly Meeting and I think it was a favored, good meeting and ended savory and well. Edward Hicks and a great deal to say and very searching and pertinent. But alas, poor creatures we are. A little matter 
<pb id="A0011529_003"/>

[marginal note] 5. Our son Joseph was here to see us.
[marginal note] S. Dudley died in a short time after.
About a horse at I. C. Lent. We had a sweet time in the company of our friends Edward Hicks and Steven Comfort. I was ready to call him sterling, staunch, steady, standard Steven Comfort. After our Monthly Meeting they went home. A very great rain after some weeks dry weather.
10 was First Day. At our meeting. Ann Edwards got home after six weeks, perhaps, out in Pennsylvania. She said a little, and at last the weight fell on me, and I don’t know whether I ever stood up in a meeting in more diffidence and fear of myself but through mercy come off with satisfaction.
11th. Second Day. Very rainy and a very watery aspect at present.
12. Rained all day and all night. A great storm.
John Parrish, my dear old intimate friend, said he sometimes had thoughts in the night which he thought was too good to be lost and used to rise up and get his pocket book and pencil and write in the dark so that he might not forget the subject. How precious are thy thoughts unto me, oh God, and how great are the sum of them. If I should count them, they are more than the sands of the sea. When I awake I am still with thee, said the prophet David <note resp="transcr">Psalms 139: 118-119</note>  . Thoughts: third Day morning very rainy. We read of the good remembrancer that was promised should come and would bring all things needful into remembrance. And he said, my sheep hear my voice and follow me <note resp="transcr">John 10:26-7</note>   and the voice of a stranger they will not follow. And again we read in the Old Testament: they shall know how to refuse the evil and choose the good <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 7:16</note>  . There is a spirit in man and it is the inspiration of the Almighty that giveth them an understanding <note resp="transcr">Job 32:8</note>  . Said Elihu, is not this the great thing in religion - to learn, to understand, and distinguish between the voice of the stranger and true teacher and to know how to refuse the evil and choose the good? It seems as if people in common believe these things. See Thomas Chalkley’s account: an old woman found him crying and asked what was the matter. He said he did not know without it was because he was a naughty boy. She said, it’s the devil tells you so, for you are the best boy in all our street.

12. Eighth Month, 1817. Third day morning very rainy. William Shewen <note resp="transcr"><italic>Counsel to the Christian Traveler</italic></note>   says vain thoughts are great troublers of the world and the language of the prophet Jeremiah was: wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts [be] lodged within thee <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 14:4</note>  ? Only observe how that when any alarming calamity approaches, how vain thoughts are turned out and willingness wrought in them to make room for their betters. In the time of the plague in London, it is said, the people were all in tears, and I heard N.S. say when the yellow fever raged in Philadelphia that they might stop and talk with a neighbor in the streets at that time and frequently see the tears run down their cheeks. There, says he, was silent worship. So we read the law of the Lord is sure, enlightening the eyes, the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul and making wise the simple <note resp="transcr">Psalm 19:7</note>  . Although people are generally so taken up with the crowding cares and [encumbering concerns of this world, very many find no time to consider of nor care nor to prepare for the world to come. Only see how it is, how all worldly concerns sink into an equal nothingness – hardly a name little enough to call them by! Then, as William Penn says, the cry is a world of gold and of pearl for a little more time when as they had given up all their precious time for a little of this transitory world. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of spirit, <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 1:2</note>   Solomon.
14. My daughter Abigail and I went to Woodbury Quarterly Meeting with our neighbor, Samuel Church, and Abigail Matlack. It was a very large meeting and divers worthy, able ministers – Richard Jordan, Edward Hicks, Simon Gilum, R. J., and E. Hicks – were much shut up, and the labor in the ministry seemed to fall on some of rather smaller gifts – on Simon Gilum, myself and some others. I thought there was something of a solemn, quieting, heavenly nature and it ended savory and well and that thought for business was an open, good time.
<pb id="A0011529_005"/>
15. Were at Youth’s meeting at the Woodbury. Service in the ministry fell to the lot of Simon Gilum and myself and some others. Edward Hicks did appear in supplication, and I believe it ended well and to general satisfaction. We dined at John Tathame, Jr., where there was a house full, some aged, middle aged, and youth. My mind was arrested with some thoughts which seemed to me was not altogether for myself. I mentioned it to Simon Gilum, and we had sitting with them and a lively, owning time I believe it was. We lodged at James Cooper's where was a house pretty well filled with Friends, but none appeared concerned to bring back the King. Does not the King of Kings stand still knocking at the door of our hearts? Oh, how seldom we do as well as we might do! I thought the minds of the people wanted to be raised from lower sublunary enjoyments to something more divine and sublime. I thought the ancient language was applicable to us, viz.: lift up your heads, ye doors, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates, and the king of glory shall come in. Who is his King of glory? The Lord of Host, he is King of glory <note resp="transcr">Psalm 24:7-9</note>  , and as Azariah testified to the people of Judah and Benjamin and told them the Lord would be with them whilst they were with him and if they sought him he would be found of them, etc. <note resp="transcr">2 Chronicles 15:2</note>  . Oh, to think of the great offers held out to our acceptance! How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?
At this meeting I seen many of my old acquaintances of Salem and between here and there who expressed great gladness and love and respect for me. I thought I never seen the like before; it was affecting almost to tears, the feeling nearness and uniting regard, the expressions of kindness and inviting language, I having been weakly and sickly and confined at home very much for seven years past.
Whilst I was at Woodbury I heard of several remarkable, sorrowful scenes. A few days ago a woman was so frightened with the thunder she went into convulsion fits and died in a very short time and left young children near Woodbury. And in the time of these late great rains and high winds that at Baltimore the floods of water swept off some horses with the families in them and that the arches of the bridge became choked up with rubbish that the flood raised so high as to come up to the second floor of some houses, and some lives were lost. And at Little York the like dreadful accounts and some say fifty drowned and found in Delaware since the storm.
<pb id="A0011529_006"/>
17 of the Eighth Month, 1817, was First Day. At our meeting. Very poor and low forepart, and no wonder! A state of ease and indolence seems to have gained the ascendancy over very many. I thought it would overwhelm all, but at last I ventured and was helped beyond expectation and came off without condemnation, although the waters were very low. The scarcity of bread is for want of labor and the scarcity of water for want of digging. Ann Edwards appeared in prayer, and I thought the meeting ended savory and well at last.
21. Fifth Day. At our meeting. The words of the prophet sweetly accompanied my mind; see Psalms 87 and 3rd: glorious things are spoken of thee, oh City of God, and of the apostles. Expressions of the fruit and effects of true religion and the blessed and great attainment of that church and people to whom he wrote his epistle. He tells them they had come to the new and heavenly Jerusalem, to the city of the saints’ solemnity, to the church of the firstborn whose names were written in Heaven <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 12:22-23</note>  . And are we endured with rational understandings, capacitates, gifts, and talents capable, if rightly improved, to attain to the like blessed experience in some good degree. And how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, etc., etc. <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 2:3</note>  ? The meeting was very small, and in answering the queries there was so much dryness and formality, so much of the creaturely man’s part, I had hardly patience enough to bear it, and I fear scraped rather harder than some could well bear. But on the whole, feel pretty well satisfied.
22. This morning I picked up a piece of newspaper dated 15 of August, 1817, <italic>Relf’s Philadelphia Gazette</italic>, giving accounts of the dreadful distress and destruction of the great floods and inundations of waters occasioned by the late great rains at Washington City, August 13, and at Baltimore and places adjacent - of the destruction of their mills of all sorts and manufactories of all sorts and at Little York. At some places the flood swept away many houses of diver sorts and people in them were crying for help as they floated down the stream on the tops of the houses, and none could help them, but some were taken into boats out of the windows. The damage in mills and manufacture, dams, bridges, etc., can hardly be recovered or estimated.
<pb id="A0011529_007"/>
An account of a dreadful storm in New England and eastward we had a few years ago wherein many lives were lost as at this, and as great destruction in mills and stores. As at this time they say the streets near the scene of this dreadful misfortune are covered with ruins and that this was a terrible visitation of providence and will be too many unfortunate people irretrievable in its consequences. This flood is said to have risen from four to six feet higher than the memorable flood of ‘86. This imperfect sketch is – rely on it – is by no means exaggerated but in truth comes short of a full picture of the distress. So we read, fear ye him who can terribly shake the Earth <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:19</note>   and whom the clouds, winds, [and] waves of the sea obey. But, alas, what little lasting impression they make and how soon forgotten. Even the destruction of the world by Noah’s flood and the destruction of Sodom and the great and mighty acts of the Lord by sword, pestilence, famine, etc., etc., etc., and earthquakes! What vast countries and cities and multitudes of people; many thousand sunk into ruin in a few minutes!
[marginal note] An account also eastward of dreadful destruction by floods of rain. One man, it is said, lost  acres of famous wheat.
24. First Day. At our meeting, pretty large. John Hallock of Egg Harbor (a native of New York government married a poor girl, Lydia, brought up with us) he had very acceptable service and Ann Edwards also, and it was a satisfactory, open time to me. I thought an unusual quiet, stillness, and solemnity attended the meeting.
28. Fifth Day. At our meeting. I had a choice to be silent but was not and have no cause to repent it. I believe it was for some one or more I stayed there and lodged at Joseph Matlack's and visited divers of my old acquaintance in the town to satisfaction – some very ancient and some under great affliction, Doctor Stokes and others.
29. Was our select meeting. Although I thought there was a great want of life and power and of the overshadowing of truth, yet on the whole not destitute of it. Something owning and sweetly, uniting and healing, comforting and strengthening to me. My friends owned me.
30. Seventh Day. I went to my son John’s to get a plow fitted up in my every dirty dress, not knowing it was their select meeting. But I sat with them, or stood with them, and had good satisfaction. Although I thought the waters were low as to the life and power of truth, there was sweetness and feeling nearness at last.
<pb id="A0011529_008"/>
31st of the Eighth Month 1817. First Day. At our meeting a very poor, low, dry time – a shut up time like all around, no savor or life. And no wonder idleness so much prevails. As to the outward, with many the scarcity of bread is for want of labor and the scarcity of water for want of digging. Like some we read of who said, I cannot dig and to beg I am ashamed <note resp="transcr">Luke 16:3</note>  . To dig too idle and to beg too proud. Yet under in my hearing name of stewards feign would shroud.
As William Hunt once asked the people: children, have you any bread? And told them they were too idle to labor for daily bread and that they looked to him. To be a lazy, idle pack – we may consider how far this is applicable to us.
{1817-09}
4 of the Ninth Month. At our Monthly Meeting, and a precious, sweet one it was to me. Sarah Cressen and Deborah Stuart of Haddonfield were there. Sarah had very open, extensive, acceptable service. She is a sweet singer in Israel <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 23:1</note>   and it seemed to sing some to sleep, but she had very pertinent service. Deborah appeared in prayer and it ended savory and well. The meeting for business also more lively than common and many thought it was a favored good meeting. It was a satisfactory one to me once more.
7 was First Day. Asa Matlack and his wife and our daughter Abigail and I went to Cropwell meeting and had no cause to repent it. To me it was as open, owning a time as I remember to have had there, openness and feeling nearness was felt. After meeting we dined at Joseph Evans and sweetly enjoyed one another’s company, but into light and trifling a way. We had need to be always on our watch to do as well as we might do, which I think is but seldom.
[marginal note] at Cropwell meeting Jose Coles, an old drunkard, was there, who has took to coming to meeting since we have had these meetings at the Green Tree Tavern and another old confirmed drunkard, they say, often comes.
10. At our select meeting at Haddonfield, Richard Jordan and others had very lively, acceptable service on the whole. It was a searching, open time. I had some share in the labor to good satisfaction.
11. Was our quarterly meeting. Richard Jordan was raised in a great eminence. Edwin Atley of Philadelphia and Nathan Yarnall and others had lively service and answering the queries. Life and savor attended and covered us; I had satisfaction and some share in the labor.
<pb id="A0011529_009"/>
1817 What a mercy it is we are thus favored with a living Gospel ministry. There was signs and tokens of the marks of the word of a right spirit. I think evident to and I think they must acknowledge with the Egyptians of [indecipherable] that the finger of God is in it. Very different from [indecipherable] and effects of that spirit amongst the people met together for [indecipherable] learn the arts of war for the defense of the country, when, a few years ago, in their rioting, drinking, and reveling some were killed and some wounded. Like them we read of whose thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths, their feet run to do evil and they make haste to shed blood. But the way of peace they know not <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 59:7-8</note>  . Oh, what a mercy it is that our lot is cast among them that know the way of peace and walk in it! Now in these days of great depravity and dissipation among many, oh, how very great is the difference between the company of those skilled in the art of spiritual warfare and those of the carnal murdering spirit! Oh, that we might improve the many precious opportunities and means offered for our help! Or surely will they not militate against us if we do not.
[marginal note] Weather very hot. I was almost exhausted and overcome with the long meeting and hot, dry weather.
14th of the Ninth Month was First Day. My wife, daughter Hannah, and granddaughter, little Mary, went over Ancocas Creek to see our ancient sister, Hannah Buzby, and cousins at Joseph Wills and were at Ancocas meeting, which forepart seemed poor and low but through unmerited mercy at last was the most open, owning time I ever had there. Oh, how open, sweet, kind, and inviting friends were when we broke up! More so than ever, we enjoyed one another’s company amongst our relations in very pleasant conversation in too light a way about worldly matters that did not tend to much profit. None appeared concerned to bring back in the King, who said; Behold I stand at the door <note resp="transcr">Revelation 3:20</note>  .
18. Fifth Day. At our meeting (small), Abigail Barker and Margaret Allinson of Burlington were there and had very sweet, acceptable service as I though. Although things seemed low and formal, they, as we, seemed to think, and spoke very prettily on that subject.
<pb id="A0011529_010"/>
21 of the Ninth Month, 1817, was First Day. I wanted to go to Westfield but was so poorly I thought of giving out going to any meeting, but did get to ours. I poorly. Things felt so poor and low and so much ease and indifferency I feared for a time we should be all overwhelmed in a spirit of ease and dry formality. But after a time ventured to stand up in great weakness and was mercifully helped beyond all expectation and came off with good satisfaction. I thought I had not seen so open a time there latterly. May it humble me.
25. Fifth. Instead of going to our meeting, I went to the burial of a black girl about twenty years of age whose parents had lived in this neighborhood and among my relations. She died at Camden at the ferry and they brought her up to Evesham to bury her. It is said she had joined the Roman Catholics in Philadelphia; however, there were a number of women, perhaps a dozen or fifteen, who, when the coffin was let down into the grave, all fell to saying something I could not understand but in a very serious, solemn manner and continued their ceremony near fifteen minutes. There was, I thought, something very serious, savory, solemn, and weighty in it, affecting and trusting. They tell me they were French Negroes of the Roman Catholic religion. At last I had something to say to them and came off pretty well.
28. First Day. My wife and children went with John Hallock of Egg Harbor and his wife – who was brought up with us and lodged with us – Seventh Day night to Cropwell meeting. The waters seemed low, but through mercy we both had a pretty open time to satisfaction, and I believe it ended savory, lively, and well.
{1817-10}
1 of the Tenth Month, 1817. Having a minute of our Monthly Meeting to visit some meeting in Salem Quarter, I left home. William Evans of Westfield my companion, we traveled near twenty miles this afternoon to his son Enoch and lodged in the evening. A neighbor came there, and we had a very satisfactory time with young people.
2nd on Fifth day. [We] were at Upper Greenwich meeting, which was pretty open and satisfactory considering thing are low at that place, as at many other places these days.
<pb id="A0011529_011"/>
[Upper right-hand corner of the manuscript missing]
We went towards Woolwich or Mullica Hill. Lodged at [missing] Snowdens where Phebe Brown lives, upwards of eighty years, [indecipherable] my old schoolmate under great affliction with something [indecipherable] cancer. They were our old neighbors and exceeding kind. We had [indecipherable] sweet, owning time at parting then went to their meeting [indecipherable] appointed meeting and the house pretty well fill and an open [indecipherable] time it was to general satisfaction, I believe. Dined at Enoch [indecipherable] then went to Woods Town. Lodged at David Davis, whose wife is my near kinswoman and received us with great kindness.
[We] had an appointed meeting there which was to me a time hard getting along, a sort of mortifying labor, as John Woolman expresses it. But several sweet little ministers helped out and it ended pretty well, I believe. This afternoon, Thomas Davis, Sarah Scull and Rebeck Hubbs (my cousin) went with us to visit the county poorhouse, where was a number of most distressed, miserable objects. Some lost their reason and were chained, and some lost their limbs, and some silly, not [no?] common sense, and some lost their reason by fits. We had a meeting with them. T.D., S.S., and R.H. had pertinent matter for the poor distressed creatures, and tenderness even to tears appeared in some that were blind, and I hope it was for the better. I forgot in its place we had with some young people at David Davis’ at parting, a very sweet, tendering time. We left them pretty plentifully bathed in tears. Elizabeth Lippincott, a very hopefully young minister, and Sarah Scull and Rebeckah Hubbs had very sweet service. From the poorhouse we went home with Joseph Bassit, who had come up to Woodstown on purpose to take us to his house to lodge, where were very kindly received.
5th was First Day. We went to Salem meeting, a very large house and well filled, where I had an open, owning time for more than an hour, like a full flowing tide. We dined at Jonas Freesland’s, a friend in good esteem, where at parting we had a sweet, owning time with his children. Then [we] called to see a widow and her daughter Phebe Miller, an old acquaintance, a native of our parts. There we had a very satisfactory time at parting, the widow being very weakly and not able to get out to meeting. Then we went to Jame Den’s (to lodge at Alloways Creek), whose wife is a sweet minister and an old acquaintance. We were at their meeting, an appointed one, which my companions think was a very good meeting, but I thought it not so open as some others were.
<pb id="A0011529_012"/>
[Top left-hand corner of the manuscript missing]
[indecipherable] came home with Joseph Bassit to lodge, who very [indecipherable] accompanied us to Alloway Creek in the morning. At parting Joseph proposed calling his children together and we had a satisfactory [indecipherable] parting. Then we came up to Asa Kerby’s. At Penn’s next day, were at an appointed meeting, there where I was much disappointed. Having been there some years ago and found things so very poor and low, I went there with reluctance. But my mind was now replenished with a hope and some apprehensions of a revival of life, that I had and open, owning, satisfactory time to general satisfaction, I believe. At parting at Asa Kerby’s we had a very tendering time with a young woman. Several women friends about Piles Grove and Salem told me the tendering impression they had received when they were children in opportunities or sittings in their fathers’ houses 30 or more years ago, when I used to attend Salem Quarterly Meeting, and the words that I had expressed had made lasting impression on their minds. And now several of them become grandmothers and useful members of society and one of them a minister in good esteem. But in some families where our lots were cast, there seemed to be no room for any such thing as a religious opportunity. But I observed that if the discourse turned on worldly affairs – fatting of cattle, telling how many bushels of wheat they had raised on an acre, and other grain, and how many hundred pounds of flax they had on an acre – then I found they were in their element, very wise and knowing about worldly business. And the world had opened her mouth and swallowed them up like the briars and thorns choked the good seed <note resp="transcr">Matthew 13:22</note>   and as to religion they were become as dwarfs, mopes, and cripples besotted. We came from Asa Hirbey’s up to Woodbury, lodged at Samuel Micles.
[marginal note] Doctor Stokes was buried while I was at Salem, aged 5 [indecipherable] died of the dropsy. Supported a good character as a doctor [indecipherable].
Fifth day, 9th of the Tenth Month. We were at Woodbury Monthly Meeting, at which, through mercy, I was helped and strengthened beyond expectation, having been so unwell I could eat neither breakfast nor dinner. So we got through fully according to prospect and I believe parted with our friends with an evidence of the ownings of truth and feeling nearness and uniting regard, and got well home to my house after meeting and found all well, all of which mercies call for humble gratitude and dedication of heart. At Penn’s Neck and Piles Grove there is a dreadful alarm with mad dogs, which have bit many creatures and some people.

12th of the Tenth Month, 1817. First day at our meeting which I thought was attacked with an easeful lukewarm spirit so [indecipherable] if it would overwhelm and swallow up all. I felt the attack [indecipherable] with the feeling infirmities of old age, but as I endeavor [indecipherable] to struggle and labor against it, was mercifully helped at [indecipherable] and had an open, owning, strengthening time to good satisfaction. This day we heard of three burials: Deborah Stuart of Haddonfield, a worthy, sweet minister of an unblemished character about seventy; and Esther Venable of Moorestown, a widow upwards of eighty; and William Rowlands of Vincentown, a most miserable drunkard [who] left a wife and family of children. And a young man came up from Philadelphia to Moorestown, went with others in a party of pleasuring, got to diverting themselves with a large swing in the time of meeting when that worthy able minister Joseph Hoag from New England was at Moorestown. The young man got a fall and, it is said, cracked his skull so that he lay some days speechless and his life yet despaired of. And at or near the same time a man and woman was drowned at Philadelphia and several more narrowly escaped drowning through some mismanagement getting on the steamboat.
16. Fifth Day. At our meeting. I went with a hope and willingness to have a silent meeting. There were divers strangers, young doctors. I felt an exercise and knew not for who it was. One of these young doctors, a comely young man, had give way to excess in drink, and – as I was told after – somewhat alarmed with the sudden death of the youth killed with the swing, who we now hear is dead. I had something for them, but not (as I thought) with that strength and ability as I have been favored with latterly. However, not much cause of complaint. The young doctors, though several quite strangers, got round me and seemed very respectful. I am told that they think Deborah Stuart’s death was occasioned by a fall in the street near her own door. She fell with her breast on the root of a tree and hurt her very much. One would think her situation as much out of danger as any, but strange to think how accidents happen which no care or precaution of ours can prevent, and the many ways that bring people to their end.

[indecipherable] Tenth Month, 1817. Was First Day. Mary Witchel of Frankfort, Pennsylvania, (a native of England) was there and had very acceptable service, and I thought a savor of truth attended, and which them that knew not what it was, must have had a sense of. 
23. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Though small, was a lively, strengthening one to me, tending to unite to the wise in heart. Although in general, as far as I can hear, it is and has been a very healthy season, yet we almost daily hear the language of mortality sounded in our ears. We now hear of the very sudden death of James Wood, middle-aged, a wealthy man near Haddonfield. It is thought he died with an apoplectic fit. And of the death of Samuel Key, near Haddonfield, a very hard drinker in the midst of his days – left a widow and children. And at the same time of the death of a black young woman at Moorestown. Thus the ancient decree, almost as old as the creation – dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return <note resp="transcr">Genesis 3:19</note>   – we see an almost daily fulfilling. And to take a view of the bulk of mankind as a family at large, it is said that many are dropping into eternity every minute. And as Daniel Stanton said on hearing of the death of a friend, our time is a coming. And Thomas Ross once said, when he heard of the death of Mordecai Yarnall, a worthy minister, well, says he, repeating it over and over, Mordecai is gone; by and by we shall be gone. And as Sarah Gissum once said, if we can but get to a better place when we are done with this world it will do. But, oh, how prone we are to be too careless about that.
26. First Day. At our meeting open, but not all together as satisfactory as some. Something wanting, somewhere, somehow. A great thing to keep clear of self gathering corn and so forth.
30. Was Fifth. Silent as to me, but E.R. and Ann E. had lively service. A very great rain, the greatest fresh we have had a considerable time.
{1817-11}
2. Eleventh Month, First Day. At our meeting. Very large, full, crowded. Daniel Haviland from Nine Partners, State of New York was there and was very large in testimony and to general satisfaction, I believe. He was here with us and at our house about 18 years ago, aged about 71 now.
<pb id="A0011529_015"/>
6 of the Eleventh Month. Fifth Day. Was our Monthly Meeting. Something of a heavenly quiet, as I thought. On the whole it was a satisfactory time to me throughout, although there was two cases concerning worldly interest, which I thought hurt the life and savor, which I think money matters always do when they get into our meeting. All very wise and knowing in their things and they can gabble about them as if they were at market or vendue if they can say nothing about things of a more spiritual nature.
13. Fifth Day. We went to the burial of Thomas Bishop, a relation to my wife. He lay about one week very ill with the gravel, an innocent, orderly, inoffensive man. The people conducted very orderly, and it was cordial and comfortable to see so much of a Christian like spirit in attending him in his illness and at the burial. But yet it seemed to me it was too much in the spirit of Martha of old, to whom Christ said, Martha, Martha thou art careful about many things; one thing is needful <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:41-2</note>]  . And the mind not enough turned towards the better part which Mary had choice, of which should never be taken from her that so we might know more of the evidence and ownings of truth and the savor of life and the great Master’s presence amongst us at these solemn seasons. In thy presence, said David, is fullness of joy, etc. <note resp="transcr">Psalm 16:11</note>  . I came off middling well, well satisfied.
16. Was First Day. At our meeting and had no cause to repent being there, but sweetly satisfactory to think of it on my pillow. We went to see two sick neighbors. At the last, something owning and uniting and satisfactory, but all the day was not as I could wish. Oh, how great a thing it is to keep clear of every spot or stain, wrinkle or any such thing! The subject was concerning honesty, seriousness, and sincerity. And it remains to be true there is that scattereth and yet increaseth, etc. <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 11:24</note>  .
Fourth Day. 19. Amos Peasley of New England (who was with us some month ago) appointed a meeting at Moorestown which was pretty large, and I thought he did famously and worthily. A large door of utterance, but I thought a door of entrance was much wanting. Powerful preachers and dull hearers, not like it was when three thousand was converted at the preaching of Peter and when hundreds were convinced at one meeting in the days of George Fox and William Penn when there was often much tenderness and contrition, but now more frequently dullness and drowsiness and sleeping instead of weeping under the most powerful ministers. A great rarity to see a tear or tokens of tenderness.
[marginal note] But they seem to think nothing of going any further.
<pb id="A0011529_016"/>
Plenty makes dainty and the full stomach loathes the honeycomb <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:7</note>  . As Daniel Stanton said when he was told how the people at Moorestown was pleased with his preaching and wished he lived there to be there every First Day – how glad they should be to go to hear him - ah, said he, I reckoned it would soon be like an old song. And as George Fox said when the people of New England was so taken with his preaching they began to consult together to hire him to stay with them to preach to them, he said it was time for him to be gone. But when he seen people at their meetings settled down in solemn silence with their minds turned towards the Lord, then he said they were finally settled in the truth.
This morning we heard of a dismal accident or scene of sorrow. A lad about 18 years of age lived with our neighbor Joseph Hugg, got up about 2 o’clock at night to help his master get ready to go to market. His master got up about fifteen minutes after him and found him on the fire, burnt to death. He carried him to the pump to put out the fire on his clothes but could perceive little or no signs of life. He was subject to fits and had fell in the fire once before, but they pulled him out so that he received no hurt, only singed his hair.
20. I went to the burial of this young man that was burnt to death. The family in which he lived were not members of our society nor the people gathered, but they conducted soberly, orderly, and well, and I had an open time with them with which one of the near relations of the deceased expressed satisfaction. At the grave I had a few sentences to good satisfaction. We heard of two burials this day at Moorestown, a man and a young woman. Although it is counted a very healthy season in general, both in city and country, yet we hear of deaths almost daily or very frequently.
23. First Day. At our meeting Lidia Lippincott and Ann Edwards appeared lively and savory, yet I thought it a low time, however. Too low for me to venture, though am doubtful I missed it and am not alone, for one expressed a secret sense of the same thing.
Fourth Day. Went to see our kinsfolks William Hooton and went to see John Hollen, a poor man who has a cancer lately increased to an alarming degree. 
Fifth Day. At our meeting. 
6. At our select [meeting]. Pretty well.
30. First Day. I went to Cropwell meeting a time of low water and scarcity. For want of labor I found it hard getting along, yet it felt pleasant to look over the day. I took a young doctor lately come amongst us or he took me, and we went to see the man with the cancer, and I took him some little things.
Twelfth Month, Third Day. Elizabeth Collins, my old fellow traveler in visiting families, came to see us with Esther Collins and others and we did not talk ourselves poor – a rarity and satisfactory.

4th of the Twelfth Month, 1817. See [Robert Proud’s] <italic>History of Pennsylvania</italic>, volume 2, William Penn’s letter, page 4th, expressing a desire to glorify God in our bodies, souls and spirits, in temporal or eternal affairs, being indeed none of our own. For as much as we are our own, we are none of the Lords. A great mystery, but a great truth, and of absolute necessity to witness. To be of the number of the chosen nation, the peculiar people and royal priesthood of Christ and his glorious Kingdom. Oh my friends, let all below this keep on the left hand and wait to feel those blessings or blessed things to inherit right hand, etc., etc.
5. I went to their select meeting at Cropwell. Although the waters seemed low, yet there is a precious remnant, a little seed and I believe we were somewhat comforted and strengthened together. John Haines and wife, elders came here and lodged with us, and we went Sixth Day to our Monthly Meeting, which I think was an open, owning, lively time, especially forepart something savory.
Seventh Day. I went to Evesham Monthly Meeting, where I found Daniel Lukens and wife of Pennsylvania, Chester County. His wife is a lively minister and had good service and also Ann Edwards, both had very acceptable service. An owning, solemn time. Mary Lukins was my companion when I visited the families of their meeting. They went to Upper Evesham Monthly Meeting. 
[marginal note] Very cold freezing weather.
7 of the Month First Day. At our meeting. Ann Edwards had an open favored time.
10 of the Month. At our select meeting, there was a number of strangers, many lively ministers who had open. Lively service. 
11 was our quarterly meeting at Evesham. There were many worthy, lively young ministers who had very open, lively service. Richard Jordan concluded with a very solemn, powerful prayer, and it was thought these meetings were crowned with the evidence of the owners of truth. Betsey Purington of New England, Samuel Rhodes of Darby, Simon Gillum and divers others of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. The largest meeting ever seen there, perhaps, and as solemn and orderly as I ever seen there.
There was a solemnity, savor, and sweetness in the silent part that strengthened a hope that we were advancing towards that state which is better and beyond words, which is the end of all good words or gospel ministry: the superior excellency of the Christian religion, which is a communion with Christ.
Seventh Day. 13. Killed our hogs, about 1,000 wt.
<pb id="A0011529_018"/>
14th of the Twelfth Month, 1817, was First Day. At our meeting. Sarah King and E. Collins and Lydia Lippincott and several others appeared lively and savory. A satisfactory meeting to me, although I was so unwell in the morning I thought I could not go out. But concluded it was better to wear away than to rust away, so wearied along and went this afternoon at 3 hour to a meeting at the schoolhouse near the Green Tree Tavern, among a people that seldom ever attend any place of worship, for whom I have some time past been thinking of and have endeavored to stir up others to think of them and have opened the door for laborers and divers strangers. A little back Edward Hicks, Joseph Hoag of New England, and Betsey Purinton, and Mary Witchell, and others. Ann Edwards appointed this meeting and desired me to go with her, which I did and had no cause to repent it, for this day’s work afforded me satisfaction on my pillow. Ann Edwards has now got liberty to visit this people in their families, forty or fifty families, perhaps, in that neighborhood in the compass of two or three miles.
16. I was invited to the burial of an old Negro woman but did not go. Weather cold and I not very well.
18. Fifth Day. At our meeting strengthening. As Joshua Evans used to say, if we are but favored, we fear no colors, and as Thomas Gawthrop said, you may think this strange doctrine, but, Tom, don’t mind that as long as his master stands by. I felt as if I was not afraid of being had up.
21. First Day. At our meeting. Most extreme cold freezing weather and through mercy I believe it ended savory and well. About two weeks ago it was so cold and freezing it set the boys a skating, but it growed warmer and broke up all the ice till now. It as cold and freezing as is commonly known here. It has, till now, been a very fine, moderate Fall. We have foddered our cattle but very little till now within a few a few days. About three or four days before what is called Christmas.
<pb id="A0011529_019"/>
Twelfth Month 28. Was First Day. At our meeting. John Hallock and Elizabeth Collins, both of Egg Harbor, were there and had savory acceptable service. Last First Day was a very remarkable cold freezing time; the river was froze up and lay fast some days. But it has been now several days past very fine and moderate. We have not had any snow yet to cover the ground more than a common white frost.
29. Very fine, warm moderate weather [for] several days.
{1818-01}
1st of the First Month 1818 and Fifth of the week at our meeting, which was and open, strengthening one to me. Weather very fine and moderate. I hear that several have got their feet badly frozen [during] last cold spell and in divers places a great alarm of mad dogs. About Moorestown and divers other places, it is said, divers people have been bit by mad dogs and other creatures, hogs and other creatures. Our neighbor S.C. lost two hogs [to] mad dogs.
4. First Day. At our meeting pretty full and through unmerited mercy it ended lively, savory and well. Sweetness and feeling nearness appeared after it broke up. I went to a meeting at the schoolhouse near the Green Tree Tavern at 3 hour appointed by Ann Edwards (who is now engaged in visiting families there away). Ann sent word she wished me to meet her there, and I hope the meeting was for the better and ended savory and well. Very moderate, fine weather.
7. On Fourth day Betsey Purrington from New England appointed a meeting at Moorestown, which I thought forepart was very poor and low, but it grew better, and she had acceptable, savory service, and it ended solid and well.
8. Was our Monthly Meeting, and it was a downright lively, open, favored time throughout. It made me think of an account of Friends in early times; it is said friends met at a meeting for discipline and there was so much of the stirrings of life that one stood up after another till they were forced to adjourn the meeting. It seem they were not ruled by form, nor did they limit the spirit.
11. First Day. At our meeting. Rebecka Burr of Mount Holly had lively, acceptable service and Joseph Justice also, so I thought it ended pretty savory.
14. Now is the first snow so as to cover the ground so as to track a fox, and seven men on horseback rode through our place and hunting hounds with them. I think it is a great pity they were not better disposed and employed.
<pb id="A0011529_020"/>
15 of the First Month, 1818. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Small. There was great plenty of words among us, but I thought a want of savor and life which only and alone can give satisfaction and true consolation. It is an easy matter for us to tend meeting and not for the better – but, oh, how deep in guilt, how ignominious the fault! A teacher throned in pomp of words. Dr. [Edward] Young [resignation] in deeds beneath the taught – again unto the wicked the Lord saith: what hast thou to do to declare my word or that thou shouldst take my covenant in thy mouth seeing thou hatest instruction and casts it behind thee <note resp="transcr">Psalm 50:16-17</note>  .
17. I went to see John Hollen, a poor man with a dismal cancer on his temple and eye. Divers others have now dreadful cancers. Simeon Ellis and Benjamin Bispham and divers round about have of latter years died with cancers. And what is worse, if possible, several have lost their reason. Nathan Yarnal of Philadelphia – a well approved young minister, I hear – they talk of taking him to the asylum newly erected for such who lose their reason, and James Frinch’s wife also quite crazy. See the scenes of sorrow and humbling circumstances and solemn calls.
18. First Day. At our meeting. I thought it was a good, favored, open, owning time, I believe to general satisfaction. Oh, what a mercy! Winter-like: stormy, cold, freezing, some rain, hail, and a little snow.
22. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Several were pretty open, but not me.
25. First Day we went to Evesham – an open, highly favored time. Spent the afternoon with our son John and choice grandchildren. There was openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness when we came out.
27. A very great rain; stormy weather, but not cold.
29. At our meeting, which was sweet and satisfactory to me some clothing. Several days [of] very severe cold weather.
{1818-02}
1st of the Second Month. First Day. Very cold. I was at a stand about going to meeting, but did get there and had no cause to repent it. Such an open, owning time I [have] seldom, if ever, seen there. When we got home, the query was: what made you stay so long, what kept you so late? Evidently helped and strengthened. meeting pretty full. This was the first snow to set sleighs a running.
<pb id="A0011529_021"/>
5 of the Second Month, 1818. Weather more moderate. Was [at] our Monthly Meeting, which I thought was pretty open and lively, although it was not so satisfactory as some to me. I was poorly with a heavy cold, but I thought there was not much cause of complaint and that both sittings ended sweet, savory, solid, and well.
8 was First Day. At our meeting. It was a mortifying time to me, and perhaps good and needful for me. Thy rod and thy staff hath sustained, said the prophet David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 23:4</note>  . Humbling. We have had now several days very severe cold weather, none more so this winter.
12. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Weather more moderate. Some life, some salt, some cloathing [clothing], some satisfaction. We are informed that John Braddock and Levi Lippincott, both of Evesham, were lately struck with the palsy and several others very much wounded by accidents. Joshua Lippincott with a very bad cut and Joseph Coles with a bad fall – broke his thigh. Very cold again. We heard about this time of the death of Abigail Stokes at Burlington. She was struck with the palsy and died very suddenly. [She] was once an overseer of our meeting, a daughter of William and Hannah Foster. Had a mortifying humbling pilgrimage. Oh, the scenes of sorrow all round us! James Frinch: his wife very crazy, kept chained, and a number others in her condition.
Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Lively words enough and some pertinent remarks, yet need of improvement in solidity, depth, and weight. Snow storm and cold.
22. First Day. Abraham Hibbern of Goshen in Pennsylvania there and had very savory, acceptable service. Savor and solidity attended to general satisfaction, I believe. What a mercy continued.
Fifth Day. At our meeting: Learn not the way of the heathen <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 10:2</note>  . Satisfactory.
Sixth Day our select meeting. Our daughter Abigail went with me for the first time. Some thought it a favored, lively time to select meeting. Not fully so to me; rough work not the pleasantest, but sometimes necessary. We hear that an ancient woman went to warm her cape and it catched fire and set her clothes on fire and burnt so that she soon died (Sarah King’s mother at Slabtown, 4 miles above [Mount] Holley).
[marginal note] I think four old women have been burnt to death now within a few years.
<pb id="A0011529_022"/>
{1818-03}
1 of the Third Month, 1818. First day. Quite warm, road very [indecipherable]. At our meeting and to me I thought it was an owning, favored time; something that cast out fear. This afternoon we went to the burial of our neighbor, Benjamin Williamson’s wife (died sudden with a stroke of palsy). They had their Baptist minister there and high doings preaching, and singing of psalms, prayers, etc. Some thought there was some salt, savor, and life, but if it was so, it was all hid from me. Yet I thought it was an instructing time to me, under a feeling sense of the difference between ability which truth gives and the want of it. Our meeting last First Day did not leave a comfortless, mortifying remembrance, but quite otherwise. A very great storm of rain and at last considerable snow and cold weather. Very changeable from warm to cold.
Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting and I think I [have] seldom, if ever, seen a more lively, evidently owning a time. From first to last answering queries there was great openness for labor, and very many very pertinent remarks were made and savor and life attended. Is it not a wonder, every thing considered, that we should be thus followed and favored in the first part? I had an evident, owning, favored time. Oh, how it calls for humility!
Fourth Day last, that violent stormy day, Solomon Sanders near Cropwell was buried. [He was] in the midst of his days [and] left a family, wife and children. Few, if any, have exceeded him in the improvements of worldly affairs. As the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth rich and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and in the end become a fool <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 17:11</note>  . He was a very industrious, moral man.
9 was First Day. We went to Evesham meeting. My sins are ever before me, said David <note resp="transcr">Psalms 51:3</note>  . It was a mortifying time forepart, and I was very desirous do right, either to suffer in silence or otherwise. But at last was evidently helped and an open, owning time it was. The meeting was large and some there that seldom come, who showed very pleasant and very respectful.
Went to see our daughter-in-law, Ann, brought to bed with a daughter.
[marginal note] I told one of our elders he looked pleasant. I believed I had not displeased him this time; he said, not one bit.
<pb id="A0011529_023"/>
11 of the Third Month, 1818. My daughter Abigail went with me to our select quarterly meeting at Haddonfield (for the first time), which was smaller than common. Richard Jordan was favored to speak most excellently and Thomas Kite, a young minister of Philadelphia. But it proved to be a very mortifying, stripping time to me, but perhaps needful and profitable. It is a great thing to bear prosperity unhurt, either temporal or spiritual.
12. We went – that is, all the family (except our black hired man) – to quarterly meeting, which was very large. Richard Jordan was raised again in great eminence to preach very powerful, and in the last meeting it was an healing, satisfactory time to me. So here I experienced the difference between peace of mind and the want of it. Restore me to the joy of thy salvation and uphold me by thy free spirit, said the prophet <note resp="transcr">Psalms 51:12</note>  , none else can. Heard of the death of Cornwell Sevenson, an elder of Burlington Quarter, a choice, innocent friend. [He] left a widow and family of children middle aged. Short illness, something like the typhus fever, of which there seems to be divers instances creeping about of late.
15. Was First Day. At our meeting. An open, owning time, I believe. To general satisfaction as far as I could see. If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, etc. But if our hearts condemn us, he is greater <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:20-21</note>  . A wounded conscience who can bear <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 18:14</note>   bear? If we can keep a conscience void offence towards God and man <note resp="transcr">Acts 24:16</note>  , the whole world cannot condemns us <note resp="transcr">Stephen Crisp</note>  . But if our conscience condemn us, the whole world cannot justify us; so great is that judge. And as Habakkuk says, though the fields should yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>  . And as [John] Hoiland say, the righteous fear not the crush of worlds and as Seneca says, if the earth should open her mouth and show them all the secrets of the infernal pit, they would look down upon them without dismay. Abraham Gibbens said in my hearing he had seen a state wherein death was no more terror than to put of one suit of clothes and put on another, or to go out of one room [and] into another. And William Hunt said when the mind had passed through the necessary baptism, there was not much for the fear of death to lay hold of. Oh blessed and glorious experience, how far it transcends all this world can afford! Remember Mary Dyer and thousands of martyrs.
[marginal note] Daniel in the lion’s den, Shadrack in the furnace <note resp="transcr">Daniel 6 and 3</note>  .
<pb id="A0011529_024"/>
William Law says conscience is God’s (vice-regent for judge). When we do right and do well, we find acceptance and justification. Our conscience justifies us when we do well; when we do not do well, it condemns.
Conscience unpleasant truths may tell 
But mark her sacred lessons well: 
They that live with her at strife, 
Parts with their better friend for life.

Will it not be our greatest friend or greatest enemy? A wounded conscience who can bear? As to a clear conscience, one says it is the best estate, and again:
The music and the mirth of Kings
Is out of tune unless she sings.
Then close thine eyes and sleep secure: 
No peace like thine, non left so sure.
A quiet Conscience is the best, 
Has only peace, has only rest. 
The music and the mirth of kings 
Is out of tune unless she sings. 
Then close thine eyes and sleep secure: 
No rest like thine, no sleep so sure. <note resp="transcr">From a popular poem called “A Quiet Conscience,” sometimes (most likely erroneously) attributed to King Charles I</note> 

But how is it, on the other hand, when we miss it and do not do well? Then I know how it is with me; I remember the command of the angel was curse ye (or condemn). Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they come not up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty <note resp="transcr">Judges 5:23</note>  . This I have often to do through the abounding frailties and infirmities.
He is more a prince that rules himself
Than he who nations keeps in awe.
Who yields to that which doth their souls convince
Shall never need another law. <note resp="transcr">From the poem “The Soul” by Katherine Philips (1632-1664), first published in 1667</note> 
He that ruleth his spirit is stronger than he thought taketh a city, says Solomon <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 16:32</note>  .
Long have I sought the wish 
Of all true happiness to find, 
Which some will wealth and some will pleasures call
And some a virtuous mind.
What cannot resignation do? 
It wonders can perform; 
That powerful charm, “thy will be done,” 
Can lay the loudest storm. <note resp="transcr">Edward Young, “Resignation”</note> 

I do solemnly declare that after seeking happiness for years in the schools of the learned, in the philosophy of ages, and in the pleasures of the worlds, I found her not till I became acquainted with this pure and vital principal. Dillwyn last page.
[marginal note] He that makes conscience his counselor will find it his comforter when all of them stand aloof or fail, yea, everlasting life. 
[marginal note] He that would have the comforter must receive the reprover, says Isaac Pennington
<pb id="A0011529_025"/>
14 Third Month, 1818. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Not satisfactory but rather a mortifying time, yet I thought deeply instructing. All fair weather is not best; pruning and purging necessary.
22. First Day. My daughter Hannah went with me to Easton meeting, which is but a small, little, poor meeting and great indifferency, ease, and indolence prevailing there (as is most other places). I was desirous to do right there – if it should be best to suffer in silence with the seed under oppression – but at last was helped and had a very open, satisfactory time. A few days ago Joseph Moor’s House in Evesham (which was large) was burnt down from a spark of the chimney and some goods burnt in it. And near the same time, we hear that the Powder House at Wilmington caught fire and blowed up a great quantity of power in it. It is said thirty persons were killed in it. The sounds of the explosion was heard by divers here in Jersey.
[marginal note] Stormy
23. We hear of the death of Hannah Fish, wife of John Fish, a few years ago our nearest neighbor, died at [indecipherable]. A distant relation to my wife [and] left a number of children: two sons, almost men, grown and silly, no common sense, and a young child a few weeks old. A very innocent, industrious couple. She was very much out of her senses several weeks before she died. Now to think of and see the scenes of heart piercing sorrow, the heavy strokes on families and individuals almost daily all round us, these solemn awful calls. One would think, if we seriously considered, if our hearts were not as hard as the nether millstone or the adamant stone, they would serve as serious calls to a devout and holy life. Call after call, after divers ways and divers manners as in days of old.
Heard of the death of Joseph Hoag of New England, a worthy minister. [He] was here whilst I was down at Salem, so I did not see him. His wife and several children, ministers low in circumstances, but very cheerful and seemed to have a sense of his end being near. Died soon after he got home.
<pb id="A0011529_026"/>
26 of the Third Month, 1818 was Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Small, [though] not altogether destitute of some savor and life. But, oh, how very little of that to what it might be if we were not wanting on our part! It seems to have come to this: to be considered a high degree of religion and piety, to keep clear of gross enormities and to lead a moral life, even although they know no more of the life of God in the soul than a sheep. Be ye not as the horse or the mule that hath no understanding, said the prophet David <note resp="transcr">Psalms 32:9</note>  . And see Memorials [1787], Sarah Morris’s words: if they can but live in prosperity and keep clear of gross evils they sit down at ease and conclude all is well, but, oh, that they may find out their mistake before it is too late. Some snow.
29. Was First Day. My neighbor same church went with me to Westfield meeting, which was the most evidently owning, open time I ever seen there, I believe. Oh, how pleasant all seemed when we came out! Inviting kindness, sweetness, openness, and feeling nearness. But, Oh, how great a thing it is to keep right!
If I am right thy grace impart
Still in the right to stay.
If I am wrong, Oh, teach my heart
To find the better way. <note resp="transcr">From the poem “Universal Prayer” by Alexander Pope</note> 
When we are so, let me remember the mortifying time I had just before this meeting.
28. Hannah and I went to the burial of John Hollen, 72. He died with a cancer on his temple, which spread over one side of his face [and] got into his mouth and throat, and it was some weeks difficult for him to eat, and it is likely he starved to death at last, as I believe many have done with that disorder. The people behaved very still, sober, and well, and I had satisfaction with them, especially at the grave. They owned me, and I believe there was something of an evidence of the ownings of truth, and I came off with right good satisfaction. At Cole’s Church, as it is called.
<pb id="A0011529_027"/>
{1818-04}
2nd of the Fourth Month, 1818, was Fifth Day. At our meeting. Came off pretty well satisfied, but great room and need for improvement. I have my trials, the wormwood and the gall to partake of. No longer watch, no longer safe, nor then neither; except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain <note resp="transcr">Psalm 127:1</note>  . We now hear of latter time a great many instances of people breaking or falling greatly in debt, bankruptcies of one breaking in debt and breaking and plunging others and their families in difficulty and poverty and divers who made a very great show. Diverse who were thought and thought themselves prospered of a great deal of worldly wealth, riches, and earthly treasure and who had pursued earthly treasure in a very large, extensive manner. Yet things have turned out so that divers of these will not have enough to pay their debts. Some forced to go to gaol who had made a very great show in the circle of very high life. And we hear very straight and clear of divers murders committed about Allentown; a black man stabbed a white man with his knife so that he died quickly and a malicious black boy for revenge throwed a white child into a well. What a sink of depravity is this world without religion, without attention to that preserving, right-ordering, regulating principle placed in every heart.
5 was First Day. At our meeting. I went with almost a determined conclusion to have a silent meeting but yet very desirous to do right, for I know nothing else will do. But so it was I put off out of season and if right seasons are mixed right services are lost. So it seemed as if did not get through with my lesson. After meeting I found some from a great distance and I believe stood in need of what was given to me. Yet I had satisfaction as far as I went. A burial was spoke of which seemed hurt the meeting – it being, as I thought, spoke of too early – or I believe I should have tried to have go through. I had concluded to go this day to Ancocas meeting, but, it being so very stormy, I gave out going.
<pb id="A0011529_028"/>
6th of the Fourth Month, 1818. Went to the burial of Mary Gibbs, an old acquaintance from our youth, the daughter of Robert Finch, a minister in good esteem. She [was] near my age. The company [was] not very large but very still and quiet; the practice of talking at burials as formerly is nearly dropt and done with, but yet great need of a more lively inward traveled. [There was a] want of life and savor. I had but hardish work getting along, though came off middling at the grave. I felt nothing to say till the very last, [when] a few sentences sprung up and it did right well and afforded satisfaction. The people seemed pleased, sweet and pleasant, very kind and inviting. I could but notice that one poor old drunkard (and even then a little fuddled) should have such a sense and feeling when and where there was a little life and ownings of truth stirring, for he followed me and was very pressing and inviting me to come and see him. And also one other neighbor was very pressing and inviting.
9 was Monthly Meeting. Some did think it was an open, lively, favored time throughout, and I don’t know but it was so.
12. Was First Day. We went to see our old sister Hannah Busby, lately moved to Henry Warrington’s. My cousin Benne Warrington took me over to Ancocas meeting and through unmerited mercy it was the most open, evidently owning time I ever had there, for near about one hour and a half. Never did there appear more sweetness, feeling nearness, and uniting, inviting kindness. But we came directly home.
A few weeks ago Joseph Bispham’s store was broke open and robbed of 150 dollars. The thief is now detected by his leaving a gimlet where he broke open the window, which some could say (by a knot in the handle) they had seen a carpenter use. Which, when he was taxed with the crime, he could not deny. A smart young man of a reputable family eastward. I have often sympathized and felt for the youth in their temptation.
This day heard of the death of William Wilkins. He died sudden with the gravel this day three weeks ago. He was well several years younger than me. His first wife, Sarah, [was] a worthy minister, but he married lately and not reputably. See the dangers.
<pb id="A0011529_029"/>
Last Seventh day night I had a remarkable dream at cousin Henry Warrington’s. I thought I was in a room with a number of people and that there was an unusual solemnity, and I thought my voice was lifted up beyond what I ever experienced, seemingly beyond its natural power. But the consoling, comfortable feeling that attended it was far the most remarkable, for it seemed to do me good to the heart and made me think of John Rutty’s words in his diary: soliloquy a song in the night. In the morning I went to Ancocas meeting, where was something a little or a good deal like it. But, oh, how hard it is to keep right when we are so! For so we read the heavens are not clean in his sight <note resp="transcr">Job 15:15</note>  and he chargeth his angels with folly <note resp="transcr">Job 4:18</note>  .
16 was Fifth Day. At our meeting. Exceedingly attacked with a spirit of ease, indolence, and lukewarmness, which seemed to me almost ready to overwhelm and swallow up all. Yet several had something today and in that complaining way. My wife thinks I did very well, but I thought it a very poor time (but I was unwell; was not fit to be out).
22 of the Fourth Month. My daughter Abigail and I went to the select meeting at Philadelphia, where I think there was something of a heavenly nature felt. We attended the several sittings of this yearly meeting, except I missed one. It concluded Sixth Day about noon. Some sittings were very trying and rather afflicting, but some were very solemn, favored, instructing seasons where my lot was cast. We had at divers times sweet, uniting, satisfactory opportunities in families. The love and near unity many of my old friends and acquaintances expressed of seeing me once more was beyond what I can readily describe, and was very humbling and very tendering and affecting. Very many were like mirrors or looking glass to me. Some were so weak as to express great gladness in hearing a few sentences, which I thought they had better be very sparing of however. It is a great mercy to be so far preserved and kept from sinking.
<pb id="A0011529_030"/>
26 of the Fourth Month, 1818. At our meeting John Hects and Horton Howard from the state of Ohio was there and had a very great deal to say in both meetings (for they had one in the afternoon) and preached good sound doctrine. But I could see but little animation. I believe the people take too much opium, anodyne, sleepy drops. Powerful preachers and dull hearers; it is like a pleasant song now, as we read it was in the days of the Prophet <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:32</note>  .
27. Elisha Hunt, my brother Joshua’s son of Redstone, and his wife and mother and several neighbors paid us a very acceptable visit.
28. My wife and I went to Evesham appointed by John Heald and Horton Howard. They both had a very open time and spoke very well, and I hope it will be as bread cast upon the waters and found after many days, as I find it is in some instances.
29. A very sick man desired to see me and Ann Edwards at Moorestown. I went and we went to see Samuel Laning and wife, [an] old acquaintance, quite blind [for] many years. Then I went to see the sick man in deep consumption and came off with pretty good satisfaction, although at some places it seem hard work to come at anything savory or lively. This day’s work wearied down.
Fifth Day. I did not go to our meeting. Rested to recruit.

Sixth Day. Hannah and I went to Cropwell meeting appointed by John Heald and Horton Howard. Came off about as well as is common nowadays. This afternoon we had a meeting at the school house near the Green Tree Tavern, which I thought ended savory and pretty well, considering all things. The people chiefly such who never make no pretenses to any religion. I expected the strangers home with me, but they stole them from me till next morning they came and Abigail and I went with them to Haddonfield meeting. Horton preached till one o’clock. It ended to my pretty good satisfaction.
3 of the Fourth [illegible] Month, 1818. First Day. I went to the burial of William Cowperthwaite, an old school mate and fellow prentice about six weeks older than myself. [He] died suddenly in a fit of the apoplexy at the Mount Holly and came off with satisfaction in this day’s work.
<pb id="A0011529_031"/>
Although the fatigue was almost more than I was able to bear, so that at the meeting the forepart the infirmities of old age and the very great want of a more living concern, I felt as if I must pass the meeting in silence. Yet through mercy was helped and strengthened with an evidence of the ownings of truth. At last, however, they were very open, kind, and inviting, especially a great man, a magistrate, a man of a good disposition and natural abilities. I called to see Jacob Hollinshed – aged about 84, a very constant attender of our meetings till a few months past to satisfaction. Got well home, well satisfied, although I did not seem to get quite clear of Mount Holly meeting, which I have been thinking of some weeks. Their language was over and over, one after another, come and see us again come and see us again, etc.
A few sentiments of Benjamin Lay: Money the love of money – the destruction of nations – the foundation of evil. Again he admires Numa Pamplilias [Pompilius] when he refused the Kingdom. Oh, wise Numa, famous virtue! Again he admires the wisdom of Lucurgus in preventing foreign wares and merchandise. He says, I admire the wisdom of that man. Again he notes William Edmondson’s words: Mammon – cursed love of Mammon. Mammon surfeits and corrupts the mind and darkens the understanding. Oh, the blessed doctrine and practice of the first Christians, which kept out luxury, pride, and cursed covetousness. Again, the joy at selfish spirit is Satan’s spirit. Again, a few things serve a right mind; find the world’s glory hath destroyed many.
7. Fifth Month, 1818. At our Monthly Meeting William Williams from Indiana western territory and was large in testimony. [He is] a work man that need not be ashamed, yet some speak lightly of such as he. See the impudence of the present generation. I thought it was an open, favored time to my satisfaction.
8th. I went to see a poor sick woman who seemed much in the innocency to satisfaction, then went to Evesham Monthly Meeting. William Williams was there but silent and left the meeting, he being taken very sick. I left him at Isaac Haines’s; they got the doctor to him. I came off without condemnation, although rough work. Weakness prevails there.
<pb id="A0011529_032"/>
We have had a very severe, cold winter and but little snow, so that the winter grain is very much killed on heavy land. Many field[s] look as if they would not produce the seed again; many say they never seen the like. How many ways are the fruits of the field destroyed! And a very cold backward spring, but very few warm days, which makes it seem more admirable that there was on the 6 of the Fifth Month, 1818, a very heavy thunder shower here with us and in other places. It is said the thunder and lightning was most tremendous towards or at Lancaster and in order parts of Pennsylvania. I am told several barns were burnt with the lightning and some creature[s] (horses, etc.) were burnt in them, and others very narrowly escaped being burnt. Oh, to think of the many solemn calls and warnings after divers ways and divers manners. But oh, how blind, how deaf and stupid we! We don’t consider and we will not see!
10th of the Fifth Month. First Day. At our meeting, and a precious, open, owning time. Some besides myself thought it was scarcely if ever seen the like there. William Ashby of Philadelphia told me he thought I had gotten a new lease, etc., etc. But, oh, the different sentiments concerning ministry! However it need not trouble us, if we can but have [the] peace that fortifies and crowns all.
William Ashby went with me to see D. Stokes’s widow of large family of children and we had an open, owning time then, so he thought it a favored day, well spent.

{1818-05}
13 of the 5 month 1818. We have had a very cold winter and but very little snow. The winter grain very in many places was much killed and froze out and very cold backward spring yet now a very wet time and several heavy thunder showers.  The fruit trees in full bloom, all sorts as white as snow, seldom ever the like seen of the abundance of blossoms.  
13 [14] This fifth day went to our meeting. Very poor. Ready to say woe is me that I dwell in Mesech and sojourn in the tents of Kedar <note resp="transcr">Psalms 120:5</note>  .   Great heights and in great depths and great heats in great cold as John Richardson remarks. Our meeting rather small (yet not the poorest).  Some things presented to my view which, as John Parrish, said I thought too good to be lost: viz I have long believed there was a blessed happy safe state attainable in silent meditation in communion with our own hearts and with our maker and I thought great cause I had so to believe because I think is has been evidently confirmed in the lives and conduct of thousands of the faithful in ages past and down to these days. Yea in countless numbers: in the faith and conscience of Noah, Job, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Yea, throughout all the patriarchs, prophets, apostles and faithful martyrs.  [John] Hoyland says the righteous need not fear the crush of world and Seneca says if the earth should open under them and show them all the secrets of the infernal pit they would look down upon it without dismay fear not them that kill the body said the divine master and indeed it appears clear they did not when the most dismal cruel deaths was threatened them. Is this not a blessed happy safe state, because if it should be their lot to be suddenly taken away as many are, all would be well with they and they landed safe where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest <note resp="transcr">Job 3:17</note>  .  Simple as it appears to very many 
<pb id="A0011530_002"/>
and insignificant to sit still and say nothing, yet if rightly seen into and practiced will it not be found to be the most exalted dignified state, the most safe and happy mankind can ever be favored or honored with our friends say in one of their epistles, say that to have communion with our maker in our silent meetings is the superior excellence of the Christian religion and Seneca says it is the highest pitch of Christian perfection.  Surely it must be the more excellent way Paul mentions <note resp="transcr">1 Cor. 12:31</note> , for how is it possible there ever was or ever can be a better that that David petitioned for when he said, Oh! Send out thy light and thy truth. Let them lead me and  let them teach me,  etc. <note resp="transcr">Psalms 42:3</note>   and to have the company of the good remembrances which was promised should come and  bring all things needful into remembrance,  who teaches as never men taught and  has the words of eternal life the wonderful councilor and  prince of peace . Surely this must be the more excellent way for how is it possible for any other way to exceed it?  Is not this the mystery hid from ages but revealed unto us, said the apostle. <note resp="transcr">Col. 1:26</note>   So I came believing as it then appeared to me that if we were favored to see our own states and conditions who should allow that the ancient language was applicable to us—Arise, depart hence for this is not the place of your rest it is polluted etc. <note resp="transcr">Micah 2:10</note> 
16 the 7th day. A very uncommon great rain northeast storm.
17 First Day. Storm continues. At our meeting.  Small but not the poorest to me.  I thought it ended savory.
<pb id="A0011530_003"/>
23 day at our meeting. Small but I believe there was some life stirring among us the mystery hid from ages. Came off middling but did not get through to full satisfaction. When shall I learn to be deliberate enough?  
Old people used to say formerly that the leaves always got to or nearly to their bigness by the 21st of their [?] month but they are far from it now.  I think I never did see so backward a spring. One thing I can but notice that is the fewness of the summer birds singing as formerly how very few to be seen to what there was in my youthful says at this season of the year-- very very few indeed. It brought to mind the Lamentations of Jeremiah See 4th [chapter], the grievous lamentation for the miseries of Judah See Jeremiah 4:25.  I beheld and all the birds of the heavens were fled etc.  and so setting forth the dreadful dissolution. It is so cold that it is remarked that we have no flies nor mosquitoes  as formerly to trouble us.
25 was first Day  my daughter Abigail, myself and my cousins Benjamin Warrington and his wife went to Woodbury meeting which was very large but as in other places a right labor was much wanting although they sat very still and orderly.  I found Thomas Ross, his words, to be true that is when the body is over much fatigued, when we come to sit down still nature calls for rest and I was hard by able for religious travel or exercise yet through and I believe it ended reputable and well; all seemed sweet loving and pleasant at last we dined at John Tatham Jr. had a satisfactory time at parting he was not at home.
[marginal note] I believe I did not get so fully clear as I might have done if I had not been over much wearied in getting there
We got well home to my house in good season but I was very much wearied.
<pb id="A0011530_004"/>
28 Fifth Day At our meeting. I thought there was something pretty savory [and] lively forepart but for want of something it was a poor mortifying time to me.  I was so poor and naked [that] I was ashamed to be seen. Not like some meetings of late-- sweetness and feeling nearness when we came out. As Catharine Phillips said, he had clothed me and he had a right to strip me. Words and life are two things and words without life are idols.  See <italic>Memories of the Life of Catharine Phillips,</italic> 334 page. 
There is no happiness here equal to perfect redemption from the world, its spirit and ourselves.  To have no hopes, no desires but in the will of God is fully giving ourselves into his holy hand and to be swallowed up of him. James Nayler says to them who have no other lovers the lord gives himself and among his innumerable blessings himself is the crown of all so then to miss of this is the greatest loss of all. See page 151 of C. P. [Catharine Phillips] journal an account of a prospect of a very plentiful harvest being much injured with by the heavy rains. Samuel Fothergill in one of his testimonies noted it as a threatened judgment from him who openeth the floodgates of heaven or stayeth them to the effecting his own righteous purposes.  The rains continuing so long so much grain was spoiled or damaged as to occasion an extreme scarcity before the next harvest. How many ways there is for the fruits of the field and labors of the husbandman to be cut off by too much or too little rain. With the hail, fields often cut off. Blasting and mildew, locusts and caterpillars, cankerworms, Hessian flies, etc. 
29 at our select meeting. A lively, satisfactory to all I believe although great room and great need of improvement.
30 heard of the death of Enoch Evans. He has been long very poorly.   Died very suddenly alone in his chair.
<pb id="A0011530_005"/>
31 of the 5th month 1818.  We went to the burial of our brother in law,  Enoch Evans, an elder whose last wife was my wife’s sister Elizabeth. He has been very poorly some years past with paralytic dropsy and a variety of disorders. At last died very sudden in his chair alone. He had a few minutes before he was found dead been out in the yard talking with their carpenter. There was a great concourse of people-- Nathan Smith of Philadelphia, Hannah Yarnall and Elizabeth Balderston of Pennsylvania. It was a pretty open time however to me and on the whole satisfactory. [Inserted: 75 [years] old] Nathan Smith and Hannah Yarnall had very acceptable service at the meeting. Elizabeth Balderston was very poorly
{1818-06}
4 of the 6th month was our Monthly Meeting.  Horton Howard and Hinchman Haines were there, just returned from New York Yearly Meeting, and both had acceptable service. The meeting on the whole was a satisfactory one to me although very great room and need of improvement. See Hoyland's <italic>Works</italic>, page 254, old age and virtue are honored with royal regard and attention.  Royalty is instructed, admonished, and blessed by the wisdom of the sage, by the miseries of the man, by the piety and prayers of the prophet.  Jacob’s last days are by far his best after all his abundance of trouble. But see page 83 concerning Cain.  He who is smitten with his own conscience is continually surrounded with enemies.  A wounded conscience who can bear but he that makes or takes conscience for his counselor will find it his greatest comforts when all other stand aloof or fail conscience unpleasant truths may tell best mark her sacred lessons well he that lives with her at strife parts with his better friend for life. A quiet conscience is the best, has only peace, has only rest our best friend or greatest enemy
<pb id="A0011530_006"/>
7th of the 6th month, 1818 First Day. Although a few weeks ago there was a gloomy prospect in looking at the winter grain, rye and wheat etc., it being much killed with the severe winter yet now there has been a fine growing warm time and both grass and grain has got up beyond all expectation and it now looks very flourishing and promising.  Alas how little do we know or consider of the power of him who can open or shut the windows of heaven: bless a little and blast a great deal in many ways hid from us. 
My wife [and] daughter Abigail with our ancient sister, Hannah Buzby, went to Westfield Meeting which was small. Seems declining rather than increasing. Waters very low although there is a remnant of valuable friends.  Like the gleaning of a vintage, one or two berries in the tops of the uppermost branches, yet at last I had a pretty open time though hard heavy getting along I came off without condemnation but some satisfaction, although not altogether that sweetness and feeling nearness as at some other times of late. This evening a very heavy thunder shower, some very sharps claps of thunder.  I hear there is accounts in the news of a terrible hail storm southward that cut down the grain very much. Horton Howard of the state of Ohio and Hinchman Haines came to see us.  H. Howard is now set off homeward.
9th  6rd Day morning.  I feel but poorly, hard beset to totter about: see George Dillwyn’s <italic>Youth Instructor</italic>, page 64, “Resignation being a cessation from the workings of self-will, is an approach to the sanctuary of silence, whose truth is revealed, assurance obtained and peace enjoyed.”  Assurance and peace. Does he say obtained? What then follows: Amen, Hallelujah in the Highest, something very great indeed for transcending all this world can afford.” 
<pb id="A0011530_007"/>
But page 65, he says, “In proportion as we are attached to our possession we are distressed with losing them.” Here then is the difference between the workings of our own wills and  true resignation to the divine will and although the fields should yield no meat yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation said Habakkuk <note resp="transcr">3:18</note>  .  Oh death, how bitter is the thought of thee to the man that is at ease in his possessions, but as William Penn says, Divers he must go. The story is as true as sad and as it was said to the man who concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years and say to his soul, eat, drink, be merry but what follows thou foot this night shall thy soul be required of thee and then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided. 
9 of the 6 month.  I hear of the death of Benjamin Morgan’s daughter about 17. It is said she had been some unwell with a cold and a pain in her head and a little flighty or unsettled in mind, but went at last and took a large dose of anodyne (which her father kept and frequently took to ease him of the gout). It is said she immediately told her mother that she had taken two ounces of the anodyne. Her mother asked her why she did it.  She said she did not like to do it but it seemed as if she was forced to do it.  She died in a few hours and buried this afternoon. Oh to think of the scenes of sorrow and the slippery places we stand in if there is such a thing as a preferring principle how needful to endeavor to early instill it into youth to build upon that rock against which the gates of hell can never prevail: the preserver of the righteous in all ages.
10. My daughter Abigail and I went to select meeting at Evesham which I thought was a pleasant time to me but Richard Jordan seemed to think it was a low however he was raised in great eminence in the exercise of his famous gift. There were many strangers from different parts: Horton Howard from Ohio and divers of Pennsylvania. Had very savory, lively service.  I was not alone in thinking it was a pleasant time.
<pb id="A0011530_008"/>
11th of the 6th month 1818. We all went to our quarterly meeting at Evesham which was very large and many worthy ministers and divers had savory acceptable service but Richard Jordan was silent and life did not rise to that degree as at some other times-- yet no cause of complaint but great cause of humble gratitude which it is to be feared is much wanting on the whole it was satisfactory in some good degree to me although I did not please myself altogether. 
14 first Day at our meeting. Favored to come off without condemnation. What an unspeakable mercy it is that I have been preferred to the day in any degree of reputation seeing so many fall into disgrace and withering yet when I retrospect I think how much is wanting and the many weaknesses and frailties of depraved nature. I think of the command of the angel which was curse for condemn, judge down etc. the Meroz because they come not up to the help of the Lord [Judges 5:23]  everything that tends to deprive us of our chiefest good, peace of mind, peace with the Lord.  I hear that the Hessian flies have destroyed the wheat in divers places both in Pennsylvania and Jersey and that the worms have cut off the Indian corn very much in some places although they have not hurt ours this season as last.
13. I am told the thunder has struck Enoch Roberts’ house, tore the roof some and several rooms and broke two looking glasses and some windows glass 120 panes but the people not hurt though some stunned so as to fall and it is said three horses were killed under a tree at Vincentown and some sheep in Evesham all lately with the thunder.
18 fifth Day at our meeting.  Small but I do think there was life and savor, sweetness more than common but alas the great thing is when we are right to keep so though we feel as though we could run through a troop or leap over the wall of opposition. The breath of heaven must swell the sail or all the toil is lost.
<pb id="A0011530_009"/>
20 of the 6th month 1818. My friend Samuel Church and I went up to my friends and his relations John Haines and Clayton Brown’s his son in law and my relation who live together and we enjoyed one another’s company with sweet satisfaction John Haines is an exemplary elder and  Clayton Brown an able acceptable minister.
21 first Day. They went with us to Vincentown Meeting. They have lately built a new meeting house and I was in hopes there was some more life and zeal among them but alas the meeting was small and the waters very low. We found Amos Kilburn there from Byberry, Pennsylvania but we all sat shut up till late then I ventured but alas the waters were so low I could do but little. Then Amos Kilburn stood up and said a good deal but the people who were chiefly young and very raw and awkward and sleepy. Even whilst he was speaking there seemed to be no savor, life or animation so to me no satisfaction. I thought they were like the gleaning of a vintage, but one or two berries in the tops of the uppermost branches as John Griffith remarks.  Some meeting quite died away and others very sickly, not likely to live long. Oh the deadness, dryness, poverty, leanness and formality that prevail. Although as to the outward the prospect of a very great harvest and grass is now very flourishing and promising but is it so the fruitfulness of the land cause barrenness in the minds of the people as of old fullness of bread and  abundance of idleness ingratiated and  forgetfulness prize the gift and forget the giver.  Has it not too generally been so there was evidence enough of abilities and industry outward in farming and agriculture? Ours alone can near prevail to reach the distant coast. The breath of heaven must swell the sailor. All the toil is lost. Of your selves without ye can do nothing, said the Divine Master.
<pb id="A0011530_010"/>
5 Day at our meeting. Very small and very poor dull and drowsy. I dare not venture to move but several did.  I thought there was a little sign of breathing or a little and but little sign of life. I was a good deal unwell. Very hot, dry weather yet showers near round about several days past.
28 first Day at our meeting. Ann Edwards appeared favored, lively and savory but all were not so to me mortifying. It is very hot dry weather here but showers near
30.  3rd day Elizabeth Balderston of Pennsylvania was at our meeting and had a pretty deal to say to us but I thought life and animation was wanting. Weather very hot. People work hard. Many very drowsy even whilst she was preaching to them in a zealous, powerful manner yet not so I hope with all.  I ventured to try again at last and have had no cause to repent it. A strengthening time. Said David have I run through a troop. Feeling a little like it after a bitter trial; a mercy continued.
{1818-07}
5 Day at our meeting. Small. It is well if it was better than none at all. Very poor and destitute of life and savor; shut up. 
6th Day Huldah Hoag of Long Island <note resp="transcr">Hunt is mistaken, Huldah Hoag was from Vermont</note>  and her companion was at our meeting.  Huldah had a very great deal to say the forepart of her testimony I thought was very extraordinary lively, pertinent and savory but I thought not so much so at last I was fearful whither or no she did not stand too long and  say the full stomach the honeycomb Lo though a plenty makes dainty too much.   Thus we have had three meetings this week. My Black man says he thinks we should be very good going to meetings so much. So they who have their eyes upon us are looking for fruit but alas I fear after all the precious fruits of the spirit is too much wanting among us and if there is no fruit we are worse off than they who go none to meeting at all. How alarming. 
5 of the month  1st Day at our meeting. Some savor and life but it was a shut up time to me as to words though not as to thoughts.  Blessed are the undefiled in the way. Oh that I were one of they. Paul's advice to Timothy take heed to thyself etc. <note resp="transcr">1 Tim. 4:16</note>   and blessed are the pure in heart 
[marginal note] I will send a famine among you not of bread but of the word; but here now three meetings [and] two strangers this week. The full stomach loaths [loathes] the honeycomb <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:7</note>   and plenty makes dainty. 
<pb id="A0011530_011"/>
6 of the 7th month 1818.  I am informed that William Hopkins of the family of Hopkins at Haddonfield is raving crazy distracted and that they took him to the new asylum this morning near Philadelphia. His grandfather was a man in great account.  Since my memory he was clerk of Haddonfield Monthly Meeting if not quarterly meeting too. Has a wife and a large family of children; has been most of his life much in the neglect of attending meetings; took to hard drinking; now gone as crazy as to threaten of killing his wife and others about him.  Oh! the scenes of sorrow, destruction, dissolution and ruin. Again I am informed that Joel Middleton near Moorestown has lost his reason. Quite crazy by hard excessive drinking;  a youngish man and few years married and settled.  Rent rolls over rent and ruin overtakes ruin and dissolution overtakes desolation. What a world of confusion and discord it is without attention to that universal regulating principle which has appeared unto all men and if attended to would do for all as is did for Paul. 
9 was our monthly meeting which was an healing, open, owning, strengthening time to me yet not altogether as I could wish. Oh the need of continual watchfulness and prayer for preservation, especially after times of favor. Mordecai after he had been clothed with the king’s apparel returned and sat at the king’s gate and Daniel, we read, sat at the king’s gate. Blessed is the man that is found watching at wisdom’s gate etc.  
11. 7th Day. It is a very pinching time of dry weather here although there has been many showers and heavy thunder almost all round us.   So we read he caused it to rain upon one city and not upon another city and they wandered to the city on which it rained to drink water. Although I am get so old and feeble and Hannah so lame in her arms that we can do but little yet we have been favored to get in our harvest and hay beyond all expectation. So far eleven horse loads of hay and several loads of rye and wheat. What a mercy it is.
<pb id="A0011530_012"/>
12 of the 7th month. First Day morning. Very hot still clear dry weather. Reading [John] Hoyland’s work concerning Abraham and page 189 his descending from the mountain after offering up his son Isaac. He says, “Who ever sacrificed to God and was a loser, whoever hardened himself against God and prospered?” Went to our meeting and a very very poor one it was, I believe, all shut up not a word among us all four: several could not bear silence and left the meeting some time before it concluded.  I could have expressed words suitable and instructing but there was no life, no ability, no strength, no authority, so poor I fear it was hardly reputable. What a pity seeing blessings are still showered down upon us a plentiful harvest and fine weather to get it in; whereas there has been seasons so wet that it has been spoiled even after it has been shoked in the field and fine crops of grass. Afternoon reading William Penn’s <italic>Select Works</italic>-- see page 688 “For until men receive, and are quickened, by this divine principle, they are hypocrites and not Christians; bastards and not sons.  Neither can they have true living Faith whatsoever they profess; nor can they truly worship God, whatsoever they perform” and page 689, “For out of Christ, out of his Spirit and nature verily we cannot have peace,” and I add what sort of living is it this world without their peace and what sort of dying will it be without it? Oh how little people consider the unspeakable value of peace and for what mere trifles we part with it for and then at last this is the cry, Oh,  ten thousands of words would I give if it was in my power for peace with the Lord.  I have called and ye have not answered was the language to some of old.  Dreadful state. Page 692 William Penn mentions a poor Indian that desired not to go to heaven if the cruel Spaniards went there. I heard of an old Negro who said he could not believe his master was gone to Heaven because he never heard him talk about or make any preparation for it. When Masse go to Baltimore to New York and Boston he get ready, he get new cloths, he talk about it. He not gone to heaven. 
[marginal note] Gardens, fields and meadows look very languishing with the drought.
<pb id="A0011530_013"/>
15 7 month 1818. See Hoylands works 1st volume, page 277 he says, “religion which is the life, the joy, the guide, the support of the universe.”  I have just been reaping until I am tired and a very little work tires me so that I can hardly get over it. We have of late had uncommon hot dry weather here although very great signs and tokens of rain and showers near all round us. The heat has been very oppressive to man and beast and we may say as they of old, the vine of Hesbon languishes <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 16:8</note>   Again see Hoyland’s works, page 344, Moses did not descend from the mount with ingrained strength though he had been upon it forty days fasting. The Jewish rabbis consider the unabated vigor, the unfading luster of the latter years of the life of Moses as the effect of having been forty days in familiar intercourse with God. What a sublime idea does this suggest of communion with God. To what a height of glory can it raise a fallen creature.  By this intercourse man becomes transformed into the image of God! The change may be seen and felt in the serenity of the countenance, in the kindness of the eye, in the melody of the voice and in the sweetness of the whole deportment.  It is easy to conceive what the world would be destitute of the modes and offices of religion when we consider what men are with the advantages of line upon line, precept upon precept, revelation upon revelation. I have often thought what a pity it is we do not avail ourselves of the great privileges and advantages of religion. The means offered for our help are far beyond those of many nations and ages past and present.
5 Day at our meeting and I believe something lively and satisfactory, healing and strong. See Hoyland’s book, 1 vol, page 246 on the history of Joseph’s life and faithfulness, “the fear of God is the best security for a man’s good behavior in every situation. And that he is not to be trusted in anything who has not conscience in everything.” Very busy getting in hay and rye and wheat etc. I picked up a little book on Christian education called <italic>Paternus and Eusebia</italic>, page 6, As all wisdom, love and goodness proceeds from God so nothing but love and wisdom and  goodness can lead to God. Again see page 9.
[marginal note] Heard of the death of Simeon Ellis who has several years been afflicted with a cancer.  John Hollen buried with a cancer lately and now Benjamin Bishop bad with a cancer.
<pb id="A0011530_014"/>
As a father’s advice to his son he says, remember that there is but one man in the world with whom you are to have perpetual contention and be always striving to exceed him and that is yourself. <note resp="transcr">Paternus</note>  Oh this self, he that conquers himself conquers his greatest enemy. He that ruleth himself is stronger than he that taketh a city, saith Solomon. A selfish spirit is Satan’s spirit, says Benjamin Lay. Cursed self says Thomas Chalkley and Alice Hayes. Very dry weather, no rain or very little five weeks. I work among the hay till I am tired down then come in, read and write. [Pierre] Charron says it was a proverb among the Spaniards: Preserve and deliver me from myself. Know thyself was written in letters of gold among the Athenians say Charron. See Hoyland 1st volume, page 281. The man that fears God is raised above all other fear in the confidence of faith. This has been verified in the example of Daniel and Shadrach, Mesach and Abednego and thousands of the martyrs since. Oh what a blessed state. Fear not them that kill the body, said the Divine master. How great that power that can inspire above the fear of death and blessed the state of those who are enriched with its favor. A never failing helper in greatest need. See Hoyland, page 222, on Jacob’s faithfulness. He says, “Herein is the world instructed, that he who fears and follows God, will, sooner or later, find his reward,” but he who does not fear nor follow God (as it is to be feared very many do how then).
19 was first Day Rainy morning.  I am wearied down helping getting in hay and grain but went to our meeting although hardly fit to go I thought very great poverty dryness and formality overwhelmed us.  Ann Edwards, Joseph Justice and I quite shut up but E.R. and A.H. had something to say, savory and lively.
20 Rainy Morning after five or six weeks very dry hot weather. Heard that a tavern keep died distracted at Haddonfield

23 fifth Day at our preparative meeting. Exhausted with old age fatigue and weariness, could hardly stem the tide and flood of ease, indifference and lukewarmness. Weather warm. People work hard over wearied and as Thomas Cross says, Nature calls for rest. When this is the case very dull, dry, poor and formal. Not crowned as formerly with manifestations and evidence of life and zeal. Not many can say the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up but something else has they don’t get to sleep in their fields and meadows: there is evidence of zeal there however I had some satisfaction at last. With hard labor finished getting hay which always has been a fatiguing laborious job favored to get through better than I could expect considering how weak handed and helpless I am.
27 first Day: This language occupied my mind: great is Diana of the Ephesians <note resp="transcr">Acts 19:34</note>  and is not this the general way in the language of conduct in the general scramble after the things of this world give give and never satisfy? See Hoyland volume 1st page 147, “When we behold men of like passions with ourselves, placed in situations similar to our own practicing, virtue within our reach; discovering a temper and disposition, which if we please to cultivate, we may attain; then, if we read not with profit, as well as delight, it must be, not because we want the power but the inclination to improve.” But see, says Hoyland, how the temple of mammon is crowded, but it is said ye cannot serve God and mammon. Went to our meeting although I was so unwell I was not fit to go. A very poor low time, all shut up. People work very hard getting hay. Weather very hot. So I have thought when this is the case our meetings are mostly dry and formal and destitute of life. The world’s calls seems to outbid all and carry all before it.

{1818-08}
6 of the 8th month at our monthly meeting.  Very large, three couples passed meeting: James Thornton and Dr. [John H.] Stokes’ daughter [Rebecca Stokes], Joseph Morgan and William Burrough’s daughter [Rachel C. Burroughs], William Cowperthwaite and Joseph Justices’ daughter [Martha C. Justice]. The first part was an open, healing, owning time to me and I believe to others. Rebeckah Price of Philadelphia, an ancient minister had lively service and Hannah Yarnall whose son passed meeting the last meeting mostly pretty well and to me satisfactory and strengthening, yet there was something one while very unpleasant to me and that was a number who had not a right came to see their near connections pass meeting and some of our friends could not be easy till they turned them all out before the couples passed meeting which I fear gave great offence to many. It brought an unpleasant feeling for a time but we seemed to get over it.
8.  On 7th day. I took my daughter to Moorestown at our meeting house to meet some friends, chiefly young women.  Joseph Clerk of Philadelphia had a concern to establish a society of young women to take care of the poor as he has done at several monthly meetings round about us and I thought there was something owning lively and savory attended. They have long or sometime past had such a society to take care of the poor in Philadelphia and I have long believed it would be of use to our young women to come under such a concern and exercise for they that help others help themselves: they that labor receive wages and gather fruit unto eternal life and seeing the ups and downs of the uncertainty of all earthly things none of us know but that we may become objects of and need the sympathy and care of such a society.  I think there are many instances that demonstrate the truth of this remark.  

<pb id="A0011530_017"/>
Many great and precious promises there are in Scripture to them that consider the poor: Blessed is the man that considers the poor, the Lord shall preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth, said David <note resp="transcr">Psalms 41:1-2</note>   etc. etc.  I have a hope it is a seed planted that will take root downward and spring upward and bring forth much good fruit that will never wither or die and I believe it will not whilst and where there is a right religious concern prevails.
9. First Day at our meeting came of pretty well satisfied I had to bear my testimony against friends and their children running to the tavern to see a shew [show] of a lion, pelican and several other birds, natives of other nations which were to be exhibited there. It is likely many will query what harm can there be in going to see these strange creatures and parting with our money to see them. They are the works of the great Creator.  I answer there is no harm in going to see them if the people did not make harm of it, but who can say they do not make harm of it in collecting much people to the taverns where many drink to excess. There have been such shows of strange creatures every once in awhile both in the city and through the country and some of our foremost friends and elders have borne their testimony against them in print and otherwise as corrupting practices tending to encourage idleness and corrupt the youth. There was a company some years ago brought along what they called a learned pig and from tavern to tavern collected much idle people to see some strange things. They had learned the pig but up in Burlington County one friend stood up with a furious zeal and drove them out of the county and as one friend said he did not doubt but one of these shows would collect more money than would pay the county’s tax, which would be much better laid out for the use of the poor and be an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord.
<pb id="A0011530_018"/>
12. Fourth Day. 1818. My old friend and  his new wife Nathan Smith of Philadelphia and  our cousin Benjamin Warrington and wife paid us a visit and I went with them to see several neighbors and  to Benjamin Warrington’s and to see our old aunt Hannah Buzby poorly but now better.
Fifth Day. We went to Easton meeting which was very small and very poor indeed but after a long time I ventured to stand up and a venture it seemed to me then. Nathan had considerable to say and it ended lively, savory and satisfactory. Dined at Samuel Roberts then came down to Moorestown. Visited Benjamin Bispham -- very bad with a cancer in his mouth of which a number have died of latter years and divers [indecipherable]. Lately it seemed hard coming at anything serious, solid, savory and weighty: but through favor came off with satisfaction. Had a little time with a sick friend at Easton  Joseph Roberts’ wife at Easton. Left my friends at Moorestown at John Matlack’s where we had a silent setting. We have had of late much rain and  it is that there has not been such a great prospect of a great crop of Indian corn many years if ever and  harvest mostly pretty good and  seldom greater crops of grass. Now see my notes in the 8th month 1816. A pinching dry season far and wide, east and west. Do the people see great plenty and great prosperity to be dangerous? Oh no, the language is give give: but see fulness of bread and idleness was the complaint against Sodom. Prize the gift and forget the giver. Has it not too generally been so of old? 
7th day. I went to my son John’s to get a plow fitted up and my cousin Henry Warrington came there and went with me to see William Hulings, a miserable captive to strong drink but they seemed not willing I should see him. I suppose he was not fit to be seen. 
<pb id="A0011530_019"/>
Then we want to see Samuel Balinger, an innocent old Friend eighty-five years old; has been a constant attender of meeting till of latter years. Had a satisfactory setting with the family, He expressed it was satisfactory to him. Then we went to see Tibbila Duril who has lost her reason and has been kept chained twelve years or more.  She knowed me and called me by name but I think she is the most miserable object I know of.  Some weeks past I have thought of visiting some of those under affliction, remembering Solomon’s words. It says, he is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of mirth, so I had a mind to try it and  have been to see several and  there are divers others, yet one distressed creature, Levi Lippincott, died before I got to see him. He has lain in a most miserable condition with the palsy years past. 
16 was first Day. At our meeting.  Nathan Smith was there but oh how were we overwhelmed with indolence and loathsome luke-warmness yet through unmerited mercy I believe it ended well and savory but oh what hard work it was to rise among them. Nathan found it so as well as I. It is a very fine growing time for grain and grass but alas as to religion it is a dry time. As Elizabeth Morris says, if they can but live in prosperity they sit down at ease and conclude all is well if they keep clear of gross enormities but as to the new and living way we read of the inward life, the hidden life, the life that is hid with Christ in God the life of God in the soul of man. This is strange talk to many in these days. They seem [not] to know nor care to know anything about it more than the horse or the mule. As David says, be ye not as the horse or the mule that hath no understanding <note resp="transcr">Psalms 32:9</note>  . Many I observe who appear to be most knowing and wise about cultivating the earth seem more stupid about religion. Take no thought for the body, what we shall eat or drink or put on, said the great master.  Seek first the kingdom and all these things shall be added. Now if there had been no more care taken for the body than there has been for the soul, would there have been such 
<pb id="A0011530_020"/>
such improvements and accommodations and conveniences as there are now to be seen: fine houses, rich furniture, gaudy apparel, gilded glittering carriages, some they tell me cost five hundred dollars and some seven hundred dollars and in arts and sciences and agriculture a wilderness turned into fruitful fields and as to the outward the deserts and solitary places blossom as the rose but as to religion I fear we are going into captivity and choosing bondage and slavery: when freedom and liberty is offered to us. Going back into our worthy predecessors coming up out of the wilderness (out of the bewildering spirit, customs and fashions of this world). Clear as the sun, fair as the moon and terrible as an army with banners. Alas what sort of a state would our poor moldering bodies have been in if there cares and concerns for the body and our temporal Interest had been treated with such trifling indifferency and indolence as their spiritual interest and care and concern for the inward man has been treated. Should we not have been in a very poor, naked, starving condition as it is to be feared the inward man with many now is destitute of a right clothing as them of old poor miserable blind and naked. It has been a very hot summer. A few summers past it was remarked to be very cool.  Some said there was frost in every month or nearly every month in the summer. How little do many think of that Almighty power that superintends the universe and presides over the seasons of wet and dry, heat and cold, plenty and scarcity, health and sickness etc. etc. 
21 of 8th Month fifth day at our meeting. Small and very low and poor forepart, yet I thought at last is ended pretty lively,  attended with some savor. If a plant or a vine or a seed should be brought amongst us that made every one rich, happy and safe that cultivated and propagated it would be a wonder if everyone did not try to avail themselves of it.  Seeing all desire to be happy but more to be admired if any should neglect it etc.
[marginal note] 130 dollars for a chair an elder gave for to ride in gilded, shining like silver. I fear we are leading our children into trouble.
<pb id="A0011530_021"/>
It was said to a people formerly, I planted the a noble vine, wholly a right seed. <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:21</note>   This I believe might be applied to us,  a noble vine, wholly a right seed came one over in the first settling of our land with William Penn and precious was the fruits of the Spirit it produced and  brought forth etc. satisfactorily. What a pity I thought it would be this seed should be lost and what an unspeakable loss it would be to the succeeding generation. This was the language of old: I planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed, but how art thou turned into a degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me. Many bringing forth sour grapes, wild fruit etc. etc.  Something owning at last and satisfactory in a good degree uniting
[marginal note] Our son Joseph and wife and son and Benne here to see us from Fallowfield, Pennsylvania.
23. First Day. At our meeting, pretty large,  Thomas Mathews and George Gibbins of Philadelphia and Hinchman Haines were there, Ann Edwards and myself and daughter Abigail all had something to say and we thought there was some solemnity, savor and life attended the meeting more than common. There was a very open pleasant feeling when it broke up, however it was more so to me than common: uniting.
27 at our preparative meeting. To me pretty lively and satisfactory. I after meeting with Ann Edwards visited the wife of Joseph Hays in the prime of life has almost destroyed herself with strong drink so infatuated and desperate after it as to break locks to get it. She seemed to take the visit kindly. At 4 o’clock John Comly of Byberry, Pennsylvania appointed a meeting at our meeting house and had a very great deal to say. Preached about two hours with good authority, sound and very pertinent matter. A youngish man has been a minister but a few years: power full preacher and dull hearers like a pleasant song and each one returns to their beloved way.
30 8th month 1818 was first Day. My daughter Abigail went with me to Upper Evesham. Abraham Lower of Philadelphia was there. I think I was careful not to sit or stand in his way and it was a pretty open time at last though very low at first as is often the case. Abraham is an amiable able minister though youngish. Dined with my sister, Hope Stokes.
31 I went to the select meeting at Burlington a satisfactory time I lodge with my old friend John Cox and very pleasantly. We did enjoy one another’s company did not talk ourselves poor, Went to see George Dillwyn and several other old acquaintances.
31 was quarterly meeting. Richard Jordan chief speaker but there were a number of others and several young ones. Very savory and hopeful;  an owning satisfactory time.
<pb id="A0011530_022"/>
{1818-09}
3 of the 9th Month 1818. We hear there were three young people drowned at Egg Harbor, going into the sea to bathe, one young man and two young women. Since our daughter Hannah was there for her health but a few weeks ago and went into the sea at the same place on the beach and we have frequently heard of their being drowned there.
3 at our week day meeting: open, owning, uniting, satisfactory
4 was our select meeting at Moorestown. Very poor indeed as I thought at first and answering our queries. Very poor, dry and destitute of life and savor. I was shut up till the latter part and yet through mercy it seemed to me a lively time. As [Robert] Barclay says, by throwing a little water in a pump and working it, it fetches up the rest. So it seemed to be and it ended to my satisfaction. As Thomas Scattergood said, it seemed sometimes as if he could run from one end of the continent to the other and as David said, by thee have I ran through a troop and by thee have I leaped over a wall etc. <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 22:30; Psalms 18:29</note>   When I was at Burlington I was crowded up between George Dillwyn and Richard Jordan which made me feel uneasy to sit with these our very greatest men. Yet fear was so taken away that I had something to say to satisfaction.  Oh what an unspeakable mercy I am thus far preserved.
6 was first Day At our meeting I had a feeling which made me think of Peter when he attempted to walk on the water and began to sink. So I had like to but was helped and seldom ever had a more open evidently owning time: “if our hearts condemn us not then have we confidence toward God” (Said the apostle) <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:21</note>   A satisfactory time after noon.  Reading <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic> page 180: Remember benefits, forget injuries: forgive reproachful tongues; overlook affronts, wish well to every individual, pray for all for whom prayer ought to be made and be a child of God in temper and conduct in spite of corrupt nature earth and hell, aiming at perfection as thy father which is in Heaven is perfect.  A precious lesson if we could but learn it
<pb id="A0011530_023"/>
Second day morning. Again see <italic>Solitude Sweetened,</italic> page 159. Is it not so as he says? After this divine entreaty Christ is dearer to me, self more loathsome, sin more odious, the world more vain, religion more pleasant, my affections more refined, my desires more on spiritual things and heaven more desirable.
3rd day morning. Again see <italic>Solitude Sweetened,</italic> page 54, Frames of soul variable of such a place and such a time one may say it was Bethel the house of God and a time of love, but neither the Bethel of God nor the time of love is to be the confidence of the soul whatever comfort it may afford. The God of Bethel, the God of unchangeable love is to be the strong tower to which every believer must always resort—Oh, deplorable imperfection. When he is absent despair begins to appear, when perfect spiritual pride is ready to spring up.  But while he in wisdom comes and goes it keeps my soul in exercise, going backward and forward to the right hand and to the left, restless till I find him.  Thus the soul is prevented from setting down on a sinful security or falling asleep in the arms of downy delusion. these things I know to be true. How ready to spring up is spiritual pride after times of favor and not keep humble enough like Mordecai and Daniel.  Return and sit at the king’s gate. Blessed is the man that is found watching at wisdom’s gate, waiting at the posts of her doors and prosperity is a very intoxicating thing and few brains are strong enough to bear it.  I have suffered much in this spot a want of keeping humble after times of favor. Oh Judah keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows we know a feast of the most delicious dainties will serve us but a very short time we must have daily bread or perish: Give us this day our daily bread etc. Christ in all and all.  And man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of his mouth. Then there is bread to eat the world knows not of. Without me, said Christ, ye can do nothing, and Paul says he could do all things through Christ that strengthened him.
10. Our monthly meeting, an open lively time.  I was afraid we should get to babbling. The business pretty well and lively yet one thing was mortifying to me and perhaps I needed it: a prospect of visiting the families of Moorestown.
<pb id="A0011530_024"/>
An invitation was given to the burial of Eli Roberts, a lusty young man about 19, son of William Roberts of Moorestown. He had been out with his gun. In the evening complained of being chilly went to bed and was found dead in the morning. The doctor thought it was a fit of the apoplexy.  
11. At 3 o'clock met at his burial a great concourse of people and a number of able ministers, but all shut almost.  I had some little remarks to make at last to good satisfaction. Last week a woman died very suddenly, the wife of an honest industrious German.  She had been in a poor state of health some time but her husband left her as well as usual about her business and  when he came home found her dead on the bed alone.
Thomas Kite of Philadelphia was at our meeting and I thought did famously and worthily; a young minister but lately recommended and most rapidly improved. He came here to see us sixth day and we had a setting and he made a notable prayer and I thought it ended for the better.
16 of the 9 month 1818 was our select meeting at Haddonfield. First part very poor and low. All quite shut up but at last it ended lively and savor to my satisfaction.
17. We all went to our quarterly meeting and a precious highly favored time I thought it was throughout.  Richard Jordan was raised in great eminence, life and authority and I thought I seldom if ever seen a more open time for labor and close plain dealing in dipping into the state of meetings. Richard Jordan expressed he thought it was a favored, owning time of close searching labor. Oh how does mercy and goodness follow us.

{1819-02}
About the 20th of the Second Month, 1819, I went to see several ancient widows and called to see a friend or friends who had lately earnestly invited me, and they said they were glad to see me. I said that was much better than if I had conducted [myself] so that they would not want to see me. The answer was a yes. I said I had been visiting and that I could not please myself at it. They said, maybe thee is hard to please. I said I thought I ought to be so; I have long thought it would be well if we were not so easy pleased with our social visits. Soon after, the subject so arrested my mind that I thought it might be of use to make some memorandum of my thoughts. I remember some years ago I mentioned the subject of common conversation in our social visits – of how poor and unprofitable it often was – in our select quarterly meeting, and it introduced a lively conference on the subject and lively, edifying remarks were made. 
William Penn says: [that] in early days, Friends spent much of their time when together in solemn silence, feeling after their own and one another’s states of conditions <note resp="transcr"><italic>Primitive Christianity Revived</italic>, first published 1696.</note>  . They were then under humbling, trying circumstances, not knowing which minute their cruel persecutions would be upon them and haul them to prison. Were we under the like trials would our conversation not often be more weighty and more Heavenly than it is? 
And William Penn says the time will come when every visit shall be a meeting and every family a church and every head of a family a minister, and he says in a little while and it shall be so. 
And William Bailey says, page 518, “and take heed of discourses among yourselves which are unnecessary, for the enemy hath a secret to effect among such things to draw your mind from the living sense of the precious seed of God in yours.” <note resp="transcr">William Bayley, <italic>A collection of the several writings of that true prophet</italic>, 1676.</note>   Is not this a necessary caution in this day of ease? And see <italic>Power of Religion on the Mind</italic>, by Lindley Murray, 11 Edition concerning John Janeway: he was full of love and compassion to the souls of men, and often greatly lamented the barrenness of Christians in their concerns with each other. O, said he, what indifference to spend an hour or two together and to hear scarce
<pb id="A0011531_002"/>
scarce a word that speaks people's hearts in love with Holiness! Where is our love to God and our fellow creatures all this while? Where is our sense of the preciousness of time? Of the greatness of our accounts? Should we talk thus if we believe we should hear of it again at the day of Judgment? Does not this speak aloud that our hearts are devoid of grace, and that we have little sense of spiritual and eternal concerns? 
I have read of a worthy woman in our <italic>Memorials <note resp="transcr">Memorial of Phebe Trimble, <italic>Memorials</italic>, Philadelphia 1787</note> </italic>  of whom they say she had a remarkable gift and disposition of mind when in company to turn the conversation on religious, profitable things. Are not such [people] much wanting amongst us? Like Amelia Nicholas, of whom it was said she would often, when in company, cry out, “Be faithful unto God; be faithful unto God,” till she was once asked if she had nothing else to say and she answered, “If I was to live an hundred years, I could not repeat it too often.”
I have been in company with my most intimate friends and we have slidin into what is called pleasant, innocent, though unprofitable conversation and we have talked ourselves very poor, lean, dry, and barren and I have been ready to adopt this language: oh, how seldom we do so well as we might do and should do! And have thought of the language of David to his friends: are ye the last to bring in the king? <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 19:11</note> . And it was said to David, blessed are thy helpers <note resp="transcr">1 Chronicles 12:18</note>  and to encourage his helpers he offered to give them rich fields and vineyards. But, alas, what are such gifts compared to what the King of Kings, who stands knocking at the door of our hearts, offers to his helpers? Either grace nor glory nor any good thing shall be withheld from them. And [he] hath said, he that heareth my voice and openeth unto me, I will come in and sup with him and he with me <note resp="transcr">Revelation 3:20</note>  . Oh, what room there is for us to improve in our converse together, to our unspeakable advantages!
I have thought sometimes, respecting our common conversation in our social visits, how far might one travel that was truly hungering and thirsting after righteousness <note resp="transcr">Matthew 5:6</note>   before he would get a crumb of bread among us. O how we can spend hour after hour talking on subject to no profit, either temporal or spiritual? Is not this loss of precious time, talking and walking after things that do not profit? So we read it was formerly: many walked after things that did not profit <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:8</note>   and loved to wander <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 14:10</note>  .
<pb id="A0011531_003"/>
Is not this an evidence that our affections are set on things below and not on things above? Or else would not our conversation be more on Heavenly things than they often are? But where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. I have observed how some can invite us to go out and look at their farms and their improvements, but less can say, “come and see my zeal for the Lord .” <note resp="transcr">2 Kings 10:16</note>  And if anyone is disposed to propose a religious opportunity in the family, they seem struck of dumb and out of their element – like the earthworm out of the earth, out of their element. In earthly concerns [they are] wiser than the children of light <note resp="transcr">Luke 16:8</note>   and appear to be not much concerned to know any thing about anything else. Woe unto them, said the Divine Master, that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 30:1</note>  . If thy Spirit go not with us, send us not hence. People, when they go a-visiting, mostly snug up a little – put on some clean clothes, not go ragged or dirty. Remember the ancient council was, “buy of me white raiment to cover the withall that thy nakedness may not appear” <note resp="transcr">Revelation 3:18</note>  . It is under a covering of a right spirit only that our social visits can be pleasant or profitable. As [Thomas] à Kempis says and I have experienced, when Jesus is present it makes all things pleasant, like a spring season. Whose loving kindness is better than life and in his presence, said the prophet, is fullness of joy and pleasures forever more <note resp="transcr">Psalms 16:11</note>  ; and not in anything else this world can afford, with all its boasted treasures or pleasures. So herein I conclude it is that our social visits can be pleasant and truly profitable and satisfactory.
26, Second Month, 1819. A very snowy day. Read the 21 chapter of Job from verse 7th to the 14, concerning them that can content themselves with prosperity in things of this world and their end.
See [James Meikle] <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic>, page 123: When the Jews were settled and in a flourishing condition, Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked, yea did worse than the heathen that were round about them. So, after the Christian church enjoyed rest and tranquility, they turned to do worse than the unconverted nations around them. When Israel fell from the worship of the true God into idolatry, Babylon was the scourge that brought the church into captivity. <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic>, page 203: as long as I dwell on Mesheck, I may expect wars; as long as I attend on sin and vanity, vexation and trouble will attend me. As I cannot be perfect while out of Heaven, so I cannot be perfect in happiness while absent from God.

{1819-03}
4th of the Third Month, 1819. At our Monthly Meeting. Life enough, if it was but all of the right sort. But who of us ever did a piece of work, either temporal or spiritual, so well that when we look back but what we may see where it might been mended? Or which of us ever spent one day so well but what it might have been spent better? Or who among us ever seen a meeting so well but that it might have been better? Oh, said Thomas à Kempis, that I could spend one hour after the best manner! But I thought our meeting was an open, favored, strengthening time to me. When I look over it, I can find but very little fault with it. [If our hearts condemn us not then have we confidence towards God, which is an impenetrable shield and an inexhaustible treasure which at all this world cannot give nor take away.
We used to say winter mostly broke up about Burlington Quarterly Meeting, which was near 2 weeks ago, but we have had very smart, freezing, cold, snowy weather ever since.
Snow yet thick on the ground this Fifth of Third Month but now warmer. A few days ago we heard of the death [of] Enoch Hollinshead’s son near Moorestown, about twenty years of age, with a short illness they could hardly tell. He had not been brought up to attend meetings of any sort. See Isaac Penington’s <italic>Works</italic>, 2 volume page 625, on water baptism: we know, having been taught by the Lord, that there is no salvation without inward washing, which is also very demonstrable to others. But God forbid that all should be damned that are not baptized with outward water! And, I add, is there evidence, is there confirmation, is there demonstration? Or will any undertake to say all are saved that are baptized with water? But we read of a baptism which shall save them that are baptized with it. Did not Christ say to Peter, “If I wash thee not, thou hast no part in me” <note resp="transcr">John 13:8</note>  ? 
<pb id="A0011531_005"/>
I am inclined to believe there are few, if any, amongst the most zealous advocates for water baptism (about which there is nowadays very great to do) but what must allow there is evidence and demonstration that there have been in days past and in our days thousands and tens of hundreds of thousands who are saved without water baptism and that never practiced it.
6 of Third Month 1819 – They who so zealously plead for water baptism allow and say it is but an outward sign of an inward and spiritual grace and was it not said to Paul, “my grace is sufficient for thee” <note resp="transcr">2 Corinthians 12:9</note>  : and is it not sufficient for all, as it was for Paul?
6 of the Third Month at 2 o'clock we went to the burial of Arthur Collins, son of John. In the midst of his days, [he] left a widow and two children with a short illness, which the doctors could hardly tell what to call it. There was a very large concourse of people, [who] I thought behaved very orderly. Hinchman Haines had a good deal to say and thought very well and I at the grave. But I thought there was much wanting, although the words were pertinent; animation, life, and savor was wanting. Although we are so far refined as not to bury or burn the living widow with the dead husband, as we are informed they do amongst the eastern idolatrous nations, yet there is a great deal of business for the cross of Christ amongst us yet. Very many seem lulled a sleep on the lap of this world, like Sampson on the lap of Delilah, where he lost his strength and his eyesight. The breath of heaven must swell the sail or all the toil is lost. What damage there is and how prone people have ever been to sit down content with a moral righteousness, like the scribes and Pharisees we read of, like Paul before his conversion. Who could say as touching the law he was blameless <note resp="transcr">Philippians 3:6</note>  ?
7th was First Day. My mind has been turned towards Cropwell several weeks past, but it seemed as if way did not open for me till now. My dear daughter, H., encouraged and opened the way by offering to go with me and a precious, owning, open time it was to good satisfaction. Openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness at parting.

Second Day. 8 of the Third Month, 1819. Weather very changeable. Last Seventh day, the day before yesterday, it was so warm it swept away most of the snow and our winter clothes felt heavy and burdensome. First Day pretty cold, and at night came on a considerable snow storm and some rain. Second Day clears up fine and moderate and the snow went as quick almost as it came.
10. My daughter Abigail and I went to Haddonfield select quarterly meeting. Samuel Adams [from the] State of New York and Chatlet Jones of Salem, State of Ohio, had acceptable service, but I thought it was but a low time at first. And Richard Jordan expressed [that] he thought it was a low time and said he did not know how he could get along with anything. But he did get up at last and seemed to make all shake and I thought it was as [Robert] Barclay says of the working of the spirit: it is like putting a little water in a pump and working it brings up the rest. So I thought life did arise into dominion to edification and good satisfaction.
11. At our quarterly meeting. A very stormy, snowy day. The strangers, especially Samuel Adams, had lively, pertinent, acceptable service, but at last Richard Jordan got up and seemed to make all quiver. And in the afternoon it was allowed to be a favored, owning, open time. What a favor continued to have such a ministry and such meetings! The like not known, perhaps, in many nations of the world at this day.
12. We went to our meeting appointed by Samuel Adams at hour four [in the] afternoon. A large number of people. He began to speak as soon as they were gathered and preached till sun set with good authority and lively, pertinent matter. But alas, where or what is become of the ancient dew that formerly descended on the mountains of Zion <note resp="transcr">Psalms 133:3</note>   when, at the first of Peter’s sermons, 3000 were converted to the faith? and as George Fox [‘s Journal] mentions meetings where hundreds were convinced at one time. I fear the remark is too true: they go to their meetings and are pleased with fine preaching but go home and remain just the same. As we read, “they come and sit before this as my people and hear thy words but will not do them…each one returns to their covetousness” <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:31-32</note>  . Powerful preachers but dull hearers, to whom it is as a pleasant song.
<pb id="A0011531_007"/>
14 of the Third Month, 1819. First Day. Several days past, snow all day almost. Clears up – very severe cold, high harsh wind. I thought I should give out and not go to our meeting, but that it was better to wear away than rust away and to go whilst I could, that I heard one say when he went to meeting through most difficulty, he went to best purpose and of one who said on his dying bed [that] it was a comfort to him to think he had scarcely missed a meeting he could well have been at. So I bundled up and got to meeting and was glad I was there, though things seemed very low, as they mostly do forepart. Through mercy it was as open, evidently owning a time as I almost ever had – like a full tide to sweet satisfaction. Oh, the openness, sweetness, feeling nearness when we broke up, so that it appeared to be to general satisfaction. It is not always so; sometimes I think we are so poor we have hardly clothing to hide our nakedness.
15. Went to see a new married couple, Joseph Brown and wife. He is my son John’s wife’s brother. [He] had given way to strong drink too much. It was a task, but I thought of the complaint against the shepherds of Israel, that they had not sought to bring back that which was driven away <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 34:4</note>   and of doing as we would be done by (his wife being a deceased neighbor’s daughter). [The visit] came off better than I expected; met with a very open reception, had a pretty setting, and parted with good satisfaction.
18. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Small, but it was not the poorest to me, though not that life and savor as at some times. Came off pretty well satisfied.
19. Sixth Day. We have had a very freezing, cold, snowy, winter-like time a week past, but now looks a little more like spring. When will summer come, in the best sense of the word, and the voice of turtle [is] heard in our land <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:12</note>  ?
See John Woolman’s <italic>Journal</italic>, page 354: one formerly speaking of the profitableness of true humility saith, “he that troubles not himself with anxious thoughts for more than is necessary
<pb id="A0011531_008"/>
lives little less than the life of angels whilst by a mind content with little, he imitates their want of nothing, [William] Cave’s <italic>Primitive Christianity</italic>, page 31. But I have often thought, when people are not content with what Christ promised – that is, all things needful to them that would seek first the Kingdom of Heaven – but will be scrambling and scuffling early and late, racking brain and back, primarily pursuing things of this world as if it was their chiefest good. I have seen they are as unhappy as if they were created with thousand and thousands of wants more than there raly [really] are – which, if rightly seen, would appear unnecessary wants. And, oh, how many drown themselves in destruction and perdition in the scramble after these unnecessary wants! Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. And what does it amount to at last? For we brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out of it when we leave it. And although the things and concerns of this world may have assumed such a vast and mighty importance, they come to nothing at last – hardly a name left little enough to call them by. When the things of eternity appear so inconceivably real, then all the concerns and things of this world sink into an equal nothingness. A few things, simple and plain, serve a Christian; we want but little here nor want that little long. Unnecessary wants more than real ones by far.
19. [marginal note] Third Month, 1819. 
20. Weather very changeable, snow. Snow very frequent. Mending shoes. Soled one pair, but it is but little I can do.
21. First snow. Last night cleared up, very cold and high wind. I got to our meeting. I thought [it] a low time, as R. J. says; could hardly get along, yet through mercy something like a little covering and comfort. See [Lindley Murray] <italic>English Reader</italic>, page 151: believe it, no chains bind so hard, no fetters are so heavy as those which fasten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world. No dependence is more contemptible than that under which the voluptuous, the covetous, ambitious man lies to the means of pleasure, gain, or power. Yet, this [is] the boasted 
<pb id="A0011531_009"/>
liberty which vice promises as the recompense of setting us free from the salutary restraints of vice blair [blare?].
23. We went to see our ancient sister Hannah Buzby, about 85. She is very poorly. Stayed all night, very stormy.
24. Were at our cousin B. Warrington’s where Hannah and [indecipherable] very low with the consumption. Had a pretty satisfactory time.
25. At our meeting. Very small and to me very poor and shut up.
27. On Seventh Day at 3, Catlet Jones and his companion, Samuel Davis from Salem, State of Ohio, appointed a meeting at Moorestown. The meeting not very large. C. Jones and H. Haines had a pretty deal to say, but it did but little for me. I hope others fared better. To me, low.
See Sarah Grubb’s book page 146: for what is there worth living for but to be found in the discharge of our duty? And as Abraham Gibbins said, life is not worth having without peace.
28. First Day. A barn and tan house burnt a few evenings ago at Moorestown, a stripping, piercing trial to a poorish man, George Matlack. And a house burnt a few evenings ago in Evesham near (or not far) from the meetinghouse, one Crispin’s. Realize these things and they are piercing trials to man and beast in cold weather. Weather holds very cold, gloomy. Discouraging prospects; we are become a very helpless family by one means or another, yet have been favored so far many ways beyond very many. What our trials and troubles may be, we know not, nor how we shall strand them or be upheld. See <italic>Piety Promoted,</italic>  page 21, Walter Raleigh’s last words to his son and wife: if you can live free from want, care for no more; for the rest is but vanity. Love God and begin by times. In him shall you find true and endless comfort; without his favor, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. As Sarah Grubbs says, page 146: For what is there worth living but to be found in the discharge of our duty?
Went this 28 to our meeting. Open and owning and satisfactory in a good degree. Heard of the death of Benjamin Swett, an acceptable minister of Haddonfield who we went to see a few weeks ago. 80 or upwards.
30. Went again to see our ancient sister Hannah Buzby, who is yet very poorly. It has been very changeable weather and very cold ’til this evening. A very heavy thundershower.

{1819-04}
1 of the Fourth Month, 1819. Fifth Day. At our meeting and I thought better than common, though smaller than common. How does it seem to look, after the visits of so many strangers (powerful preachers), our weekday meetings should grow less? Plenty makes dainty and the full stomach loathes the honeycomb <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:7</note>  . I have been forced to attend to some business several days past, till I am almost overdone.
4 of the Fourth Month. First Day. At our meeting, and I thought it did end with something sweet and savory, gathering and uniting. This evening high wind and thunder and lightning. Clears up fine. See <italic>Evangelical Magazine, </italic>page 323: Adam had dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowls of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth. He had the free use of all the creatures so far as they were capable of administering to his comfort. But the summum bonum was his sweet sense of the divine favor. This is and ever will remain the confirmation both of human and angelic felicity. After all the scramble after earthly treasure, it must be confessed that no joys, no pleasures, no riches, no treasures are to be compared to that of being assured of the love and favor of God, whose loving kindness, the prophet said, is better than life. And at his right hand, rivers of pleasure and fullness of joy; but not fullness of joy in all this world can afford. See [Lindley Murray] <italic>English Reader, </italic>page 187: for worldly happiness ever tends to destroy itself by corrupting the heart. It fosters the loose and violent passions, it engenders noxious habits and taints the mind with false delicacy, which makes it feel a thousand unreal evils, says Blair. Vanity of vanities, said Solomon <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 1:2</note>   after he had made trial of all the enjoyments this world could afford. Is it not said that they that live in pleasure are dead whilst they live <note resp="transcr">1 Timothy 5:6</note>   and “so much the more she hath lived delicately, so much the more torment and sorrow give her” <note resp="transcr">Revelation 18:7</note> , and again, “go to the rich men, weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon you” <note resp="transcr">James 5:1</note>  . It easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to heaven <note resp="transcr">Luke 18:25</note>  .

8. Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting. Several short testimonies, and I thought they were savory and lively, and in transacting the discipline I could not find much fault, yet great room for improvement.
9. Sixth Day See Sarah Grubb’s Letters <note resp="transcr"><italic>Some account of the life and religious labours of Sarah Grubb</italic>.</note>  , page 411: A humble resigned spirit is a gift which I believe was never refused at the altar. It is, while preserved, a continual offering, a sweet smelling sacrifice, the savor of life unto life. In those that believe, it is a bulwark or fortress where in times of desertion, temptation, and trouble the weary soul finds shelter, and all the armor of light against Satan’s attacks and fiery darts. Who would not wish to be clothed with such amour and such an impenetrable shield against their grand enemy? Heard a man in town died with the bite of a mad dog, but not a full clear account.
11. Have had very high wind. Grows rather dry, but now. First day, fine rain with distant thunder.
11. First Day. At our meeting. Forepart I thought very low and poor. Thought we should have a silent meeting, but one another appeared and at last I thought it ended savory and reputedly, a great favor. Fine, warm weather. Heard further accounts about the alarm of mad dogs in Pennsylvania about Makefield and Wrightstown. Two dogs were lately killed on suspicion and a boy bit by one of them here in our neighborhood.
Work whilst it is called to day, was the ancient command, but labor not for the bread that perisheth but for that bread that nourishes the soul up unto eternal life  <note resp="transcr">George Fox?</note> . Bodily exercise, we are told, profits but little <note resp="transcr">1 Timothy 4:8</note>  . Would it not be well if one half as much care and labor and time were bestowed for the care of the soul as there is for the poor perishing body, which soon returns to dust and comes to nothing, gone and forgotten as though it never had a being in this world? Your fathers, said the prophet, where are they <note resp="transcr">Zechariah 1:5</note>  ? It has been said truth has ever been suffered most by its professed advocates. A state of ease and lukewarmness, David Hall says, is as bad as open profaneness. And how (see Book of Memorials [1760]) 
<pb id="A0011531_012"/>
prone people have ever been, when in a state of prosperity and fullness, to sit down in a state of ease and indifference, formality and lukewarmness, prize the gift and forget the giver, and when Israel dwelt in a land not sown, he was holiness to the Lord <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:2-3</note>  . But when Jeshurun waxed fat, he kicked <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:15</note>  . And see Job 4 and 8 <note resp="transcr">Job 4:8</note>  : they that sow wickedness, reap the same.
See Hosea 8 and 9 <note resp="transcr">Hosea 8:7</note>  : they that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind Gall; 6 and 7 <note resp="transcr">Galatians 6:7-8</note>  : for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap, and [he] that soweth to his flesh shall reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall reap life everlasting.
Now read the 32 chapter of Deuteronomy, verse 15: but Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked, etc. See what followed to the end of the chapter: the heart cannot be reduced to a vacuum, that is, an empty void. If spiritual things do not occupy it, carnal things will. It is by walking with God and conversing with the doctrine of the cross that we shall become dead to other things and this will go to the root of the evil, while other remedies only lop off the branches (Evangelical Magazine page 151).
15. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Not unpleasant to think of it, but, alas, how we stand in need of daily bread and unable to keep ourselves from falling, even when only little temptations and provocations attack us. See again Evangelical magazine, page 251: we suffer most from hearts prone to rest in the cold, formal, unexperimental religion of the world, for the unrenewed heart within us is so far from being at enmity with that religion, that it likes it. Our adversary, the Devil, has no quarrel with this, for he knows well that such religion, rested in, is so far from hurting his interest that it will rather promote it.
16. A neighbor, an old drunken man, came here very drunk, singing, bawling, and hauling us about till I was almost out of patience. He went away several times, sat down in the woods, and came back several times. It rained pretty hard. A man that kept his credit, all but that of drinking too hard. I could but think of the dismal condition of the poor captives to strong drink, but also of the danger of formalists in religion. Though high in profession, being in a more blamable state and way than they, I will spew them out of my mouth, etc. <note resp="transcr">Revelation 3:16</note>  
<pb id="A0011531_013"/>
18. First Day. At our meeting. It is said the wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation; the fool, when he gains that of others. As to gaining my own approbation, I hardly know what to say, for in times of poverty and stripping we are ready to call all in question. But as yet feel no condemnation. What others think I must leave, but I am very jealous of myself, seeing how many ways there is for us to be deceived and have cause to believe very many are greatly deceived in themselves – now as formerly, when they believed they were the children of the Lord but were told they were the children of the devil and that his servant they were, whom they obeyed and served.
Many persons mistake the love for the practice of religion <note resp="transcr">Lindley Murray, English Reader, p. 11-12</note>  : shall I reward his service with falsehood, shall I forget him who cannot forget me? If his principles are false no apology from himself can make them right; if founded in truth no censures from others can make them wrong.
If you seek to make one rich, study not to increase his stores but diminish his desires. [Lindley Murray] <italic>English Reader</italic>: they that desire silver shall not be satisfied with silver and there is [he] that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing. Hope, the balm of life, sooths us under every misfortune. Then is not this hope the greatest of all riches? The righteous hath hope in his death, but the wicked say there is no hope. Then what can riches do for us? He who resigns the world has no temptation to envy, hatred, malice, anger, but is in constant possession of a serene mind. He who follows the pleasures of it – which are in the very nature of it disappointing, is in constant search of care, solicitude, rumors and confusion, XVI. I have lately been reading the writings of that beautiful creature Sarah Grubb, and find many very precious, instructing remarks, especially in page 114 and 118, 119 and 20 and 21, worth treasuring up.
[marginal note] I have lately heard the typhus fever is very mortal at Redstone.
<pb id="A0011531_014"/>
22 of the Fourth Month, 1819, Fifth Day, the time of yearly meeting. I am not able to attend it. Dizziness in my head, tottering at our meeting. Not much satisfaction. More humility fear and care is wanting; so again on First Day following. Oh, the dangers of this probationary state!
30. I went with Joseph Roberts to Westfield Preparative meeting. Small and poor and low, dry and formal, yet it was in good degree satisfactory to me and some others and divers expressed [their satisfaction]. We went to William Evans on the river and lodged and paid several visits, and some were to sweet satisfaction, especially at Benjamin Cox. Next day, came again to Westfield meeting, appointed by William Rickman, lately from England. He had a good deal to say, but he is a feeble old man like myself and his voice but very weak and low. There seemed not much animation, although I was so wearied and feeble I could hardly sit the meeting. I had at last a few sentences to drop to satisfaction, and it appeared to be well accepted, at least by the strangers. We dined with them at Thomas Lippincott’s and got well home, but my little strength was almost exhausted.
They catch abundance of fish this season, by thousands – the like, they say, not known this thirty years. I got two very large indeed. Last spring fruit trees of all sorts were as white as snow with blossoms; this spring all fruit trees full of blossoms but apple trees. On apple trees there is very few blossoms, and, as Blair remarks in his address to youths <note resp="transcr">contained in Lindley Murray, <italic>English Reader</italic></note>  , if there is no blossoms in the spring, no fruit can be expected in the fall, etc.
{1819-05}
2. First Day. William Rickman from England was there and had good service – sweetness, savor, and some life. But, alas, how little of that do we experience! If the unlawful love of lawful things did not hinder, of which he told us. Although he is but a little preacher to what some are, I thought he was a monument of mercy, being so preserved in the innocency and humility. He is a preacher of righteousness in life and conduct. I thought it ended savory and well, yet room to improve.
[marginal note] We hear of a pretty deal of sickness round about us.
<pb id="A0011531_015"/>
People do not consider that suffocation is as dangerous as starvation.
4 of the Fifth Month, 1819. A very fine shower and much wanted.
I have been thinking whether suffocation or starvation, at which has proved the most afflicting or destructive to mankind, and concluded that if famine has slain its thousands, suffocation has slain it tens of thousands – especially as to the inward life, the better life, the life of the inward man. As Joseph White said, there was more seed lost on the thorny ground, suffocated and choked with the cares of the world, than any other. And as William Penn says <note resp="transcr">William Penn, <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic></note>  , oh how are the greater part entangled and bemired in their accommodations and conveniences and want help out of the mire and clay, like David making temporary heavens. As Lady Guion says  and as William Penn says, they like them so well they would never leave them if they could help it, and adds, but divers he must go. The story is as true as sad. But is not the middle way best? The middle way to every step reveal. Let me not heights of woe nor pleasure feel. But petition like Agur we read of whose prayer was: remove far from me vanity and lies, give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient for me, least I be full and deny thee, or least I be poor and steal and take the name of the Lord in vain <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 30:8-9</note>  . As Walter Rawlie said to his wife, if you can live above want, care for no more – the rest is but vanity. The promise is, all things needful shall be added to them who seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:30-31</note>   and that no needful or good thing shall be wished from them. But oh, the scuffle and scramble after more than is needful, wrecking both brain and back! See the voyages they make and the journey they take to lay our treasures on earth. And how many are drowned in destruction and perdition <note resp="transcr">1 Timothy 6:9</note>   and how many leave them in the midst of their days and in the end become a fool, like him we read of, who concluded he had good goods laid up in store for many years: thou fool, whose shall those things be which thou hast provided <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:19-20</note>  , and is there not many such in our days? Strait as the gate and narrow the way that lead to pace and few find it <note resp="transcr">Matthew 7:14</note>  .
[marginal note] C.R., I am told, said he would not wish a better Heaven than he found here, but, poor man, he was of another mind at the last! Other[s] like him I have heard of.
<pb id="A0011531_016"/>
Would it not be better if people would spend one half their time to please the Lord which is taken up and spent to please the eye, to gratify the lusts of the eye and pride of life, which, the apostle says, is not of the Father but of the world <note resp="transcr">1 John 2:16</note>  . As William Penn <note resp="transcr">William Penn, <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic></note>   says, it would be well if they could find one half the time to please the Lord which they spend to please a vain mind, gratifying the lust of the flesh and pride of life. Oh, the growth of pride in fifty years, especially in that of carriages! May we not say with the prophet: their idols are upon their beasts and upon their cattle; their carriages are heavy laden, they are a burden to the weary beasts <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 46:1</note>  . As John Woolman <note resp="transcr">John Woolman, <italic>Journal</italic></note>   observed, how he has sympathized with them under their heavy loads and unfeeling drivers. Although the command is positive, be ye not conformed to this world <note resp="transcr">Romans 12:2</note>  , and many, very many, have deeply suffered for this testimony, even unto death and the most cruel dreadful deaths, even by fire, and stuffed in jails and dungeons, whipping, wracking, stoning, sawing asunder and on the ignominious gallows and banishment. Yet at this day, how blind are the professors of Christianity grown, at this time, respecting the danger of transgressing this command? So very many can take their full swing in gratifying the lusts of the eye and pride of life and still persuade themselves they are Christians, the meek followers of him who said follow me who am meek and lowly of heart <note resp="transcr">Matthew 11:29</note>  , who wore a garment without a seam. And respecting these things, oh, how is blindness in part happened to Israel? Pride, it is said, goes before destruction <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 16:18</note>  . If so, what may we not justly look for or expect? See the 28 chapter of Deuteronomy and 27 of Ezekiel.
[marginal note] Weather very warm and growing.
6 of the Fifth Month, 1819. At our Monthly Meeting our ministers all appeared. As for my part, I was so unwell I could hardly sit, but yet afternoon seemed better and ended satisfactory to me. The weather has been very warm, hot like harvest-time some days past. Some summers past it was said there was frost in every month.
7. At about 10 at night a man came and informed us of the death of our ancient sister Hannah Buzby, who seemed to strangle in a fit of coughing and spitting of blood. She had been very poorly and we paid her several visits, as I noted a little back, but was got brave so as to go to her cousin Benjamin’s.
[marginal note] Weather very warm and growing.
<pb id="A0011531_017"/>
9th of the Fifth Month, 1819. First Day. Stormy. We were invited to the burial of our ancient sister Hannah Buzby in the morning, very early. I was taken with a very sick stomach and violent vomiting, but after some hours got some better, but was not able to go to her burial. Our daughter Hannah and granddaughter Mary went, and all seemed well – a large concourse of people. At her desire, they took her over to Ancocas and buried her by her husband. A few weeks back she had been very poorly, but had got quite brave and was out to several neighbors Sixth Day evening. [She] eat supper quite hearty and about 8, was taken with a fit of coughing and spitting of blood. Supposed to have broke a blood vessel in coughing and died in about 3 minutes time. Aged about 85 years. She stood in the station of an elder many years and supported a good name, which Solomon says is better than precious ointment; and the day of their death better than the day of their birth <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 7:1</note>  . A great thing to get well through this world and well out of it. She never had any children.
On Seventh Day last Zilla Haines, daughter of our neighbor John Haines, was buried. A blooming youth about 16 years old, she laid ill about ten days or two weeks with a disorder, a fever – they hardly knew what to call it. A few weeks ago I gave her a hint about curling her hair over her forehead. Read 3 of Isaiah. This of curling the hair over the face is much in fashion amongst our youth, but none of them would wish to be laid out in their coffins in such a dress. They live best who live nearest that in which they would wish to die, although too few do so.
First Day morning I was taken with dizziness in my head, sickness at stomach, puking and so could not get to meeting. Very poorly. Latterly some time past, a long spell of cloudy, stormy weather.
20. Fifth Month. Fifth [Day]. I got out to our meeting, which I thought was some better than common – some life and savor. It seemed to end in to satisfaction.
See that worthy minister Charles Osborn’s papers of Ohio, called the <italic>Philanthropist,</italic> select sentences: a great talker will always speak, though nobody minds him or does he mind anybody when they speak to him Zeno? of all virtues made his choice of silence. For by it, said he, I hear other men’s imperfections and hide my own (or conceal my own, rather).
<pb id="A0011531_018"/>
23 of the Fifth Month, 1819, the First Day. I got so much better as to get to our meeting and through mercy a precious one it was to me. Something evidently owning, and it opened the way for a feeling, uniting nearness and sweetness in parting. Not very lately seen the like.
See Sarah Grubb’s letters page 114: divers of the younger sort amongst them have been visited with affliction. The day of the Lord hath come upon all that was lifted up and the projects like the ships of Tarsish, which were intended to go to fetch gold, have been broken early in their setting out, as at Eziongeber, and all their pleasant pictures spoiled. Which have evidently been permitted in mercy, that their affections might be loosened from things transient and perishing and instead thereof things durable and riches and righteousness become their inheritance.
See <italic>Evangelical magazine</italic>, page 473, The Constitution of the first Church in Jerusalem: the first Church was constituted. Utility and simplicity distinguished its organization. The officers essential to its prosperity were elders who exercised the pastoral function and deacons who superintended its temporal concerns. These were chosen by the suffrage of the people. The apostolic office, though by far the most eminent and adapted to the exercise of the Church, in its infant state. We have the testimony of one, who was never suspected of partiality for the gospel “that the primitive Church was united only by the ties of faith and charity; independence and equality formed the basis of its construction.” To the morals of its members the most rigorous attention was paid and discipline in all its awful inflexibility was impartially maintained. The disciples of the immaculate Jesus trod in the footsteps of this glorious leader, and emulated each other in zeal for good works. What humility, what forbearance, what brotherly love, what self denial, what kindness towards all men and devotion towards God marked the character of the primitive believers! The doctrine of the first Church, the divine energy of the Holy Ghost in the renewal of the sinners’ mind to repentance, the experimental enjoyments of divine truth and its influence upon our lives and tempers were constantly inculcated and the absolute necessity of faith in these doctrines was invariably urged upon all who were admitted into Christian communities. Something more serious, deep, and weighty than barely dipping the body in water. No oppressor, no extortioner among them, but a spirit and disposition quite contrary to that. A great difference between that and a state of ease and bear formality and lukewarmness now prevalent.

27. Fifth Day. I went to the burial of our neighbor Arthur Burdil’s daughter, nearly grown up to a young woman. Her disorder was much like Haines’s daughter, who died a few days ago. She was much out of her senses whilst she lay ill about two weeks with a kind of a fever. She was buried at our graveyard and then we went to our meeting, and through mercy I was favored both at the graveyard and at our meeting to come off without condemnation – a feeling of something that costs out fear. But alas, what a hard thing it is, as Thomas Ross says, when we are right to keep so <note resp="transcr">Wagstaffe, <italic>Piety Promoted</italic></note>   of ourselves we cannot. Watchfulness and prayer.
A lad, Moses Watson’s son, six or seven, next neighbor, has a son who has lain very ill two weeks past, but is getting better. These somewhat new cases but seem not much alarming.
To keep right, what humility, what fear, patience, what watchfulness, what resignation it requires. But as [Edward] Young on Resignations says: 
What cannot resignation do?
It wonders can perform
That powerful charm thy will be done
Can lay the lowest storm. <note resp="transcr">Edward Young, “Resignation”</note> 

Again, see Evangelical Magazine, page 373: as God is a perfect being, he cannot act amiss; as he is a sovereign, he has a right to dispose of the affairs of his creatures as he pleases; as he is infinitely good, he wills in all things the happiness of his people, creatures here, and their eternal bliss hereafter.
That it is the Christian's privilege follows of course; what is his duty is also his privilege. Duty is also his privilege. It is his privilege as it is his happiness, and we are so far only truly happy as we are truly and resigned to the divine will. As to be given up to our own wills is misery and distress, so to know no will but God’s is the summit of our happiness. Know, my son, says Thomas à Kempis that nothing hurts thee so much as thy own will. Self [is] the greatest enemy; they that conquers self conquer their greatest enemy.
30 of the Fifth Month, 1819, First Day. At our meeting although hardly able to go or sit, I thought it but a low, poor, shut up time to what some are. Yet I thought it ended pretty well and I was glad I was there.
We read in Scripture that the Lord’s will is our sanctification and preservation <note resp="transcr">1 Thessalonians 4:3</note>  , but has not self-will in men proved their destruction? Not only in the case of Haman, but [in] numberless numbers of instances it has proved their destruction.

{1819-06}
About 1st of the Sixth Month 1819. I have had a very poorly spell of dizziness and swimming in my head. Sick stomach and puking, could hardly walk.
Fifth Day. At our meeting silent and shut up. As to myself, poorly.
6 was our select meeting. Very poor and destitute of life, as I thought. Forepart perhaps some fared better, but poorly as I was. At last I ventured and was helped, and it ended savory and satisfactory, a sense of feeling nearness. I would thought there were a state and disposition of mind prevalent that could say with the prophet, the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up <note resp="transcr">Psalm 69:9</note>  , etc. Come and see my zeal for the Lord <note resp="transcr">2 Kings 10:16</note>  , etc. Many can say, come and see my improvement on my farm, etc., but too few disposed to say, come let us go up to the House of the Lord, etc.
First Day. At our meeting, a poor, low, shut up time to me. One of our ministers took up all the latter part of the meeting, but still if there was any life or animation it was hid from me, although I was not destitute of suitable matter. Lowness. 3rd hour we went to the burial of Dr. Joshua Hollinshead. In the midst of his days, a captive to strong drink, to be feared; shortened his days with it. Taken in fits and lay a few days unsensible. Left a wife and several children. It is wonderful to think and see how full of people our country is got to be. There was a great concourse of people of goodly appearance, as to the outward evident demonstrations of a sufficient care for the body, and as much evidence and tokens of unconcernedness for the soul. I ventured to break silence amongst them and have cause to repent it. This evening, my cousin Henry Warrington and I, being nominated by our Monthly Meeting, had an opportunity whilst a young man who lately brought a certificate from Plainfield. To good satisfaction; something owning and savory. So the day closed in peace, though very feeble and tottering. 
<pb id="A0011531_021"/>
As to the state of religion in the present day, in too general [of a] way, people seem to treat it with such a trifling indifferent way and so intoxicated with prosperity that they seem to be settled down at ease and fallen a sleep on the lap of this world, like Sampson on the lap of Delilah, where he lost his strength and his eyesight. And how unfit are they to hear whilst in such a state of intoxication and slumber. I wonder if they are not in a state harder to reach than the people were in Peter’s days, when 3,000 were converted to the Christian faith at the preaching of his first sermon, 2,000 at the next. But what people did ever bear prosperity? See John Hoyland’s works <note resp="transcr">John Hoyland, <italic>An Epitome of the history of the world</italic></note>  , page 49, 2 volume, the dreadful judgments denounced upon the Jews for their wickedness, infidelity, and unbelief: their hearts shall be made fat and their ears heavy and their eyes shut. See also the dreadful judgments, 32 chapter of Hoyland’s works, against the greatest most flourishing cities that ever were greeted in the world and the most populous nations, as Babylon, Egypt, Tyre, Sodom, Ninevah and many others. As Samuel Fothergill says, luxury and pride has been the downfall and ruin of the most flourishing kingdoms that ever were in the world <note resp="transcr">Fothergill, <italic>The necessity and divine excellency of a life of purity and holiness</italic></note>  .
10. Was our Monthly Meeting. Edwin D. Utley of Philadelphia and Hinchman Haines were there and both had considerable acceptable service and I thought if I had time and ability, I had pertinent matter –but we must give way to strangers. It appeared to be a lively time. I had some satisfaction, although at last I was so overcome with faintness and dizziness they were forced to help me out of meeting to a friend’s house before the meeting concluded, and it was with difficulty I got home. But after some rest, got better. See the words of Elisha, 2 Kings verses 2 and 14: Where is the Lord God of Elijah? When I think of our meetings and the abundance of preaching we have and the little growth and affects, I am ready to say; what is become of the ancient dew we read of that descended upon the Mountains of Zion <note resp="transcr">Psalm 133:3</note>   and the celestial showers that our first Friends so frequently mention, which was frequently witnessed in their meetings to the tendering and contriting their hearts, even to tears, so that in some of their meetings there was scarcely a dry eye? 
As Richard Davies says (see his Book page 35), we wished to feel the Lord amongst us in all our coming together. When the First Day of the week came we went to a meeting at W. Panes, at the wild copse, where we had a silent meeting, and, though it was silent from words, yet the word of the Lord God was among us; it was as a hammer and a fire; it was sharper than any two-edged sword; it pierced our inward parts. It melted and brought us into tears [so] that there was scarcely a dry eye among us. The Lord’s blessed power overshadowed our meeting and I could have said that God alone was master of that assembly. But alas, where are we and how is it with us in these days of peace and plenty?
[marginal note] A pinching time of dry weather. It is like it will cut off thousands of loads of hay. So warm it was very oppressive.

When the First Day of the week came we went to a meeting at W. Panes, at the wild cop [?], where we had a silent meeting, and, though it was silent from words, yet the word of the Lord God was among us; it was as a hammer and a fire; it was sharper than any two-edged sword; it pierced our inward parts. It melted and brought us into tears [so] that there was scarcely a dry eye among us. The Lord's blessed power overshadowed our meeting and I could have said that God alone was master of that assembly. But alas, where are we and how is it with us in these days of peace and plenty?
Our first Friends tell of heart-tendering times they had at their meetings. At one, they say, the floor where they sat was so sprinkled with tears that it looked as if there had been a sprinkling of rain upon it. But alas, how rare a thing it is nowadays to see a tear or tokens of contrition or brokenness of heart. For under the most powerful ministry that we have instead of a tear they are often seen to be drowsy and sit nodding. Powerful preachers and dull hearers. As it was said to the Prophet, they come before thee as the people cometh; they sit before thee as my people; they hear thy words but will not do them; each one returns to his covetousness <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:31</note>  . As a certain writer observes, they go to meeting and are pleased with their fine preaching return and remain just the same. A broken heart and a contrite spirit, it is said, the Lord will not despise [Psalm 51:17], but he loathes lukewarmness, formality, mockery, and hypocrisy.
13. First Day. Very feeble, but I got to our meeting. Forepart I thought was very poor and low and I hardly able to stand the torrent of idleness and prescribing indifferences, but it grew better and at last I thought it end savory and satisfactory. See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>English Reader</italic>, page 256: no worldly enjoyments are adequate to the high designs and powers of an immortal spirit. Fancy paints them at a distance with splendid colors, but possession unveil the fallacy. 257: for worldly happiness ever tends to destroy itself by corrupting the heart. It fosters the loose and violent passions. It engenders noxious habits and taints the mind with false delicacy, which makes it feel a thousand unreal evils.
<pb id="A0011531_023"/>
16 of the Sixth Month, 1819. Our daughter Abigail and I went to the quarterly select meeting at Evesham, and an open, owning, favored times it was. Richard Jordan had large, extensive, pertinent service. I was favored to keep up.
17 Was our quarterly meeting, which was very large abundance of young people. I thought forepart the waters seemed very low and no wonder. Very many very idle they are no pottererors inwardly concerns they are not trifling and indifferent about earthly treasures but to wait to feel the Lord amongst, as our first Friends say they did in all their comings together. Is strange sort of talk nowadays, although the Divine Master has promised to be with the two or three gathered in his name. Yet Richard Jordan was raised in great eminence in the exercise of his most distinguished gift, and I thought it brought the meeting into a precious state of feeling solemnity and it was on the whole a favored, open, good meeting. Sweetness and feeling nearness at parting. I know no people favored in like manner with such a powerful living ministry. May the ancient complaint never be applicable to us: they come before thee as the people cometh they hear thy word but will not do them; each one returns again to his covetousness <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:31</note>  . And again, as one observes, they got to their meeting and are pleased with their fine preaching but go home and remain just the same, without improvement. Were unto the Corasin [Chorazin] and Bethsaida if the great and mighty works which have been done in Tire [Tyre] and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:13</note>  , and is it not probable many who have not had the like opportunities would have better improved?
We now hear of great alarms in Philadelphia of mad dogs; that they have resolved to kill all found in the streets and that several have died of late in divers places with the bite of mad dogs. And it is in the news that there have been of late most terrible hail storms in divers places and the grain much destroyed.
[marginal note] Many weeks very dry weather. Although divers times great signs, but went of with very little. Crops of grass very light, indeed.
<pb id="A0011531_024"/>
See Ezekiel 14 and 21: when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem: the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence. I know not what these noisome beasts were and whither or not these mad dogs may not be called noisome beasts, with which the City of Philadelphia is at this time so much alarmed (several having lately died with the bite of mad dogs). So they come to a resolve to kill all the dogs found in the streets. In the time of the Revolutionary war, when the English army lay in the City, many were pinched and straitened to get bread and it was said some of the nobility, gentry, or highest class were seen to carry a sack of meal. In the time of the pestilential Yellow Fever, they say several thousands were swept away in a few months and many fled till the streets looked desolate. Many houses great and fair were left desolate without inhabitance [inhabitants]. So we may observe they have had a taste of these 4 sore judgments, although as yet but very light to what former ages and nations have felt of them. Read the Lamentations of Jeremiah.
[marginal note] 10: Tenth Month the City of Baltimore visited with the Yellow Fever so that they encamp in the fields, says an eyewitness.
20 Sixth Month was First Day. I have had a thought of attending Cropwell meeting some weeks. Joseph Cowperthwaite came this morning and took me there, although I was so poorly I could hardly keep up on my feet. The meeting but small and religion very low, yet there is a remnant of choice friends. Although things seemed low and I very poorly, it was at last an open, owning, satisfactory time in general. Openness, sweetness, unity, and feeling nearness at parting. The fatigue, I could hardly bear.
23. We have had a spell of very dry weather. No rain many weeks; prospect of great scarcity of hay and grass. See Deuteronomy 28 and 12: Blessings promised for obedience and curses for disobedience. 12: the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy Lord in his season, etc. And see Jeremiah 4 and 25, a Lamentation for Judah: I beheld and lo all the birds of the Heavens were fled. I have admired how scarce very few birds there are now. When we used to have such great multitudes flocks of various sorts, now they are very few indeed.
<pb id="A0011531_025"/>
There is a language, a voice, in the signs of the times. As it was said, if they will not hearken to the first sign, they will hearken to the voice of the other sign <note resp="transcr">Exodus 4:8</note>  . The death among the hedges, just after they had got in the way of fencing their farms with hedge fence, which they concluded would endure always and so save the timber; the death amongst the peach trees, our most choice delicious fruit (a worm growed at the root like Jonah’s gourd); a death amongst the trees of the woods, the hickory, the most choice for fuel; a death among the white oak timber, the most excellent for building houses or carriages; a death among the black and Spanish oaks, whose bark is the best for tanning leather. Then came a destroying insect among the bees and deprived us of our honey, our chiefest sweet. Now this summer there appears a kind of an uncommon worm on the cherry trees that threatens their destruction. Doth these things seem like blessings for obedience, or like threatenings and judgments for disobedience? Do they not seem like the tokens of divine displeasure? 
See Canticles 2:12 verse: the time of the singing of birds is come <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:12</note>  . I remember when the singing of birds was charming and very pleasant. I have stopped on the road to hear the mocking birds and threshers and other sorts sing. And then whippoorwill in the evening used frequently to come close to our doors and sing, but there has no such thing been heard this season. As the prophet said, the summer or birds of the heaven birds are fled <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 4:25</note>  . But these are frivolous things, hardly worth notice with very many, although we see the prophets noticed them. See the prophet Joel: the locust and the caterpillar and cankerworm, my great army, which I sent among you <note resp="transcr">Joel 2:25</note>  .
24. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. Although idleness, indifferency, formality, and lukewarmness seems to threaten us with desolation there seems yet a little stirrings of life, although I am so poorly I can hardly keep up. Yet at last I thought it ended with a degree of life and savor.
It holds yet very pinching, hot, dry weather. Grass is much scorched. Such a prospect of scarcity of hay has scarcely been seen.
<pb id="A0011531_026"/>
27. Sixth Month, 1819. First Day. At our meeting. Our beloved friend Ann Edwards – she has been confined at home unwell several months – took up most of the time of the meeting. Had acceptable service, but to me it was a low time. I had no ability to say a word, although I thought I had pertinent matter.
See 2 volume Hoyland’s work, page 322. After a relation of the miserable, degraded state of the idolatry of many nations and the notorious principles of some abominable infidels and deists and atheists, opposing the Christian religion and the law’s reasonable and holy institution, he says: oh, Israel, happy are we; for the things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us. He hath not dealt so with any nation.
29. See Leviticus 26 chapter: blessings promised for obedience; curses threatened for disobedience – very great on both hands. See again Deuteronomy, 28 chapter: the blessings for obedience very great indeed, and the curses for disobedience as great. And have they not been verified in nations and ages to these days?
See and read the Lamentations of Jeremiah, the dismal, distressed state of the people because of their disobedience.
The prophet said: though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit be in the vine (scarcely any blossoms on our apple trees this season), the labor of the olive shall fail and the fields should yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17-8</note>  . This was a religion worth something more than mere name, talk, or poor, dry form. We have had no rain many weeks; grass pasture much scorched up, even where they had marled and manured their meadows. And where, a few weeks a ago, their creatures were up to their eyes in pasture, it is now dried up scorched brown with the drought. The state of those in these days riding in their jumping chariots is very different from the state of those when an ass’s head was sold for 5 pounds or four score shekels of silver and 4 part of a cob of Dover dung for 5. See the 27 or 28 Chapter of Ezekiel: the fall of that great nation there attended for their disobedience.
<pb id="A0011531_027"/>
{1819-07}
1 of the Seventh Month, Fifth Day, 1819. At our meeting. Small harvest time. To me satisfactory. I had a feeling that cast out fear, like one who said, “I feel as if you could not hurt me after he had been delivering some very close doctrine.”
4 was First Day. At our meeting. We had a great deal of preaching, but it was a shut up. Poor time to me. This afternoon at 4 we went to the burial of Sarah Warner, just arrived to the age of a young woman. She fell out of a tree picking cherries, broke her arm, and bruised her breast so that she died after laying in great affliction a few days. She sent for me and I went to see her several times, but had not much satisfaction. Ann Edwards had something to say amongst the people, but I thought it was but a poor time as to any things of life. They are a most exceeding poor family lately moved near us. Most of the family seem to have very little care or concern for either body or soul. This the third young woman that died now within a few days or weeks, the houses in sight of one another, just as they arrived to the age of young woman.
I have observed at burials how ready and handy many are to do anything wherein the creaturely part can be active, such as carrying the corpse, or covering it up. But as to a travel of spirit for the arisurings [arising? assuring?] of life, oh, how ignorant! And what a strange, mysterious thing it is in these days, although many goodly people! I thought the commendable Christian care of the neighbors towards this poor girl in her affliction and towards the poor family deserved encouragement.
8. Seventh Month. Fifth Day. At our Monthly. I thought on the whole it was pretty well.
9. I went to Evesham Monthly Meeting. Waters very low. It mostly is so in harvest time; people work hard. Very dry, warm weather. I found it hard getting along, but through mercy got through to good satisfaction, although I was not able to sit the meeting till quite the conclusion.
We now hear much talk and alarm of the Yellow Fever in town. Dry weather yet continues, although we hear of rain east and south some distance. Clouds have gone round us, and the grass is very much scorched up with the drought. I am told some are forced to begin to fodder, and that like to be very scarce. I think I have hardly ever seen the like, although I have seen near eighty years. The harvest generally very good and now nearly over. The Indian corn look very well yet.
10: Seventh Month 1819
[marginal note] Confusion in town about killing their dogs.
[marginal note] Dulled, as with opium (as M. Mollineaux says), settled on their lees and sat down at ease.
<pb id="A0011531_028"/>
11 was First Day. At our meeting, but not to much satisfaction. And without it, time and labor seems lost.
We are busily engaged getting hay. Weather here very hot and dry; grass and pasture very much dried up. I do not remember the like prospect of scarcity of hay and pasture. It is said many are forced to begin to fodder already.
15. Fifth Day. At our meeting, but so unwell I was not fit to go there. Wearied myself over much look[ing] after my hired men. I thought it was a very poor, low time and I had a feeling and near sympathy with the lukewarm, worldly formalists which spirit now threatens us with dissolation. I said in my heart, shall we fall victims to this spirit of ease after so much has been done for us – the suffering of the martyrs and our worthy predecessors paving and making the way smooth and easy for us? I believe it’s true, it is harder to stand wheedle proof than battle proof; some who stood faithful under suffering fell in times of prosperity.
Last week we were invited to the burial of Mary Ann Stokes, my half sister, Hope Stokes’s daughter, a blooming young woman. Died with a disorder in the head; was ill but a few days and much out of her senses. Our horses were gone to market and we could none of us go to the burial.
18. First Day. At our meeting. It has been remarked that where there is many to eat and few to work it brings the labor hard on a few. Forepart was hard work to stand against the prevailing stream and current of idleness, but through mercy it growd better and ended at last lively, reputably, savory, and satisfactory to me and I believe to others generally.
22. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting, to me poor and low. It holds very dry weather here, although after a show for rain. The creatures begin to be much pinched for pasture, and I am told that some hogs have died for want of water.
[marginal note] I have no account of any rain since the middle of the Sixth Month here, except a little sprinkling but like a dew.
25. I got to our meeting though very poorly, having had a severe spell of vomiting and lax, which it said is much complained of. It is a great thing to be truly resigned to be anything or nothing, to be like the clay in the hands of the potter or like the ax or the saw in the hand of him that shapeth it, to [be] taken up or laid by at the master pleasure. A shut time to me, but an open time to Joseph Justice.
<pb id="A0011531_029"/>
26 of the Seventh Month, 1819. We are favored with a fine shower of rain! I believe not such a rain this six or eight weeks. But the ground is got so dry it will take a great deal to soak it. I do think I never did see the fields look so mournful and the grass so scorched up, yet the Indian corn has stood it admirably where it was well tended and it looks as if there might yet be a good crop if it should be wet enough. But we must needs see how easily all our labors can be blasted or blessed. What a pity it is poor mortals cannot bear prosperity, that the fruitfulness of the land should cause barrenness in the minds of the people, as it appears it has ever been apt to do. Fullness of bread and abundance of idleness charged on Sodom; so we read Jesuran waxed fat and kicked <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:15</note>  . The full stomach loathes the honey comb <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:7</note>  . And as the old proverb says, plenty makes dainty. And the prophet said, when thou has eaten and art full then beware lest thou forget the Lord <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 8:10-11</note>  . Oh, sorrowful! The more we are favored to live in fullness, the more forgetful, unthankful, and ungrateful. See the word of the prophet: oh, ye foolish people and unwise! Do ye thus requite the Lord <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:6</note>  ? I think I remember seeing some words of one of our worthy first Friends, on this wise: oh prosperity, prosperity, what hast thou done? Not all the persecutors or open apostates that ever rose up against us has ever done us that hurt that prosperity had done. Many stood firm in suffering and fell by prosperity.
29: Seventh Month Fifth Day. At our meeting, and a lively, open, owning time it was to me to good satisfaction. What an unspeakable favor, for I have felt so poorly and feeble of late that I have thought it was almost over with me and of laying by.
Very hot, dry weather again, although a few days ago we had a fine shower.
{1819-08}
1 of the Eighth Month First Day. We went to Evesham meeting on a very dry time; I thought it was inwardly and outwardly like Mount Gilboa – neither dew nor rain nor fields of offering. I can make no account of such meetings without it is in the advantage and necessity of suffering.
[marginal note] Heard of the death of Jane Cooper the Second of Woodbury, and of Benjamin Lippincott’s wife of Evesham (died of a consumption as did one of her sisters a few years ago).
<pb id="A0011531_030"/>
4. Eighth Month, 1819. See [Thomas Clarkson’s] <italic>An Essay on Slavery, </italic>page 102: what is imprudence or what is vice but a departure from every man’s own interest? And yet these are the characteristics of more than half the world! There are sins of omission and sins of commission, and it may be that sins of omission make up far the greatest part of the catalogue of the crimes of very many. See <italic>Evangelical Magazine <note resp="transcr"><italic>The Beauties of the Evangelical Magazine</italic>, vol 2.</note>  </italic>,  page 322: Adam had dominion over the beast of the field, fowls of the air, and fishes of the sea. He had the free use of them, of all the creatures so far as they were capable of ministering to his comfort. But the Summum Bonum, or greatest chiefest and superior happiness, was his sweet sense of the divine favor this is and ever will remain the confirmation both of human and angelic felicity. I believe this sweet sense of Divine favor was intended for the chief happiness of mankind and nothing short of it. Is not this sweet sense of the Divine favor that the righteous in all ages have hungered and thirsted after, and nothing else could ever satisfy or fill them? This was the gift of the Divine Master: my peace I give unto you; this it is that can make a prison as pleasant as a palace, or bread and water as satisfactory as the most delicious dainties. This sweet sense of Divine favor, the prophet David says, is better than life <note resp="transcr">Psalm 63:3</note>   and in his presence fullness of joy <note resp="transcr">Psalm 16:11</note>  . But it is not so with all this world can afford. Set your affections on things above and not on things below or in the earth <note resp="transcr">Colossians 3:2</note>  . Oh, the dismal and miserable state of men formerly and down to these days, for want of setting their hearts on heavenly things – miserable here and hereafter, unspeakable.
[marginal note] What is it that can make a death bed pleasant to the righteous but peace of mind?
5. Eighth Month was our Monthly Meeting, and I believe it was a favored, open, owning, satisfactory time.
See [John] Everard’s <italic>Sermons</italic>, page 232: know a minute’s feeling spiritually is worth seven years speaking. To feel these things spiritually is to be a door keeper in the house of God, to talk of them or only to know them are but the tabernacle of Mesheck and the tents of Kedar, etc. <note resp="transcr">Psalm 120:5</note>  
<pb id="A0011531_031"/>
See [John] Everard’s works, page 25: Satan is like a thief, and therefore steals away and departs in the night, even while the good man of the house is asleep. Security is the bane of the soul, when men are careless and in the night of ignorance. And again, see Solomon’s words: how long will thou sleep, oh sluggard? How long will it be ere thou awake out of sleep, a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep? So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth and thy want as an armed man <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 6:9-11</note>  . John Churchman <note resp="transcr">John Churchman, <italic>Present state of church discipline in our society</italic></note>  , on the training up of children, says: prepare their minds to receive the power of truth, without which they never can be happy. Without this, there will be a want which all this world cannot satisfy, with all its boasted treasures or glittering pleasures.
[marginal note] Whilst men slept, the enemy sowed tares <note resp="transcr">Matthew 13:25</note>  .
8 was First Day. At our meeting. As to me, shut up in silence; but not so with several others. Pretty well at last, though not that clothing and sweetness as at some other times.
10. My wife and me and Hannah went to see our sister Hope Stokes and her children at Upper Evesham. We found one of her daughters very poorly with the dysentery, (which is now a frequent complaint, particularly towards and at Salem), but she is getting better. We had a pretty little satisfactory religious opportunity with them, which I found hard to come at; it is so much out of fashion. They told me of a lad, about 19, was sitting on his horse talking with some others and some hogs came running by, frighted his horse, [which] flung him down and sat his foot on his belly and he died in a few days near Upper Evesham meeting house.
13 was Fifth Day. At our meeting there was several spoke, but if the dead are not raised preaching is vain, said the apostle <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:14</note>  . Life and savor I thought was wanting; without it, all is in vain.

13 of the Eighth Month, 1819. The weather continues very hot and dry. Pasture very much dried up, so that the creatures (horses, cattle, and sheep) begin to be very much pinched for pasture. And I never remember such a complaint of a scarcity of hay for next winter, and many forced to begin to fodder. It look[s] as if there will be great scarcity of hay before next spring. Many poor people cannot get any hay for their cow, and are offering to sell them now, but cannot except at a very low price. Many farmers complain of very poor crops of hay, and some are buying hay now at twenty dollars a ton, but I believe it is a rare thing to find any to be sold at any rate. Milk cows gone dry for want of pasture, it is said.
See my Memorandums two years ago, in 1817: what dreadful destruction in divers places by the vast floods of rain, many mills of various sorts and even dwelling houses swept away, and many lives lost, and very many reduced to poverty and dizziness by the great floods of rain. Happy for them who have such a religion as the prophet Habbakuk had, who could say, although the fields should yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>  . Now read the 5th chapter of Job, particularly 22 verse: at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh. Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. Lo this, we have searched it, so it is hear it and know it for thy good promises to the righteous. Here is a religion worth something, a righteousness that will do not only in fair weather but in the greatest storm. Jonah said, when he went down to the bottom of the mountain, yet will I look again towards thy holy temple <note resp="transcr">Jonah 2:4</note>  .
[marginal note] Again see Job 12 chapter and 15 verse: Behold, he withholeth the waters and they dry up; also, he sendeth them out and they overturn the earth.

15th of the Eighth Month 1819 First Day. At our meeting. To me, a very poor time. Another stepped in as one of old said. We went to see our cousin Henry Warrington, who is just going to set of to Ohio Yearly Meeting with Henry Hull of New England. I was poorly, poor inwardly and outwardly. Hardly clothing to hide my nakedness.
19. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Hinchman Haines was there and had acceptable service, and after him I had an open, owning, satisfactory time. Openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness at parting. What an unspeakable favor.
22 of the Eighth Month, First Day. I went to Haddonfield meeting, which was a suffering time to me. Religion [has] dwindled into the poor, dry formality in too general a way, though there are a remnant of solid, worthy, Friends. They have been striped of several acceptable ministers of latter years. I found it hard work to stand up amongst them, but at last I did attend it and whilst I was speaking, a young man was taken in a violent convulsion fit, which so disturbed and unsettled the minds of the people that the meeting soon concluded. And I had no satisfaction being thus prevented, yet they appeared loving and kind.
[23] Second Day. See religious tracts, <note resp="transcr">Hunt is in error. In 1819, the Female Tract Association of Friends (Philadelphia) issued a tract including accounts of two English Quakers, Ann Knight and Mary Weston. The material referred to concerns Mary Weston (1771-1797) rather than Knight. </note>  words of a young woman who died about 15 years of age, Ann Knight. She was convinced that applying the mind to some useful branches of knowledge proportionate to its capacity greatly contributed to preserve it from the love of dissipation by opening a source of superior enjoyment. Is not this very greatly wanting amongst our youth at this present day?
[24] Third Day I went and mended two pumps, one for Joseph Evans and one for Joseph Rogers. I have not earned so much money in a day for several years past.
[25] Fourth Day I thought I would try the truth of what Solomon says, that it is better to go to the house of mourning than the house of mirth <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 7:2</note>  . So went to see a very poor old widow and also to see a poor old man many years very much crippled with the palsy. I left them in tenderness and tears. A neighbor was showing where the frost had killed his vine tree. Job Scott mentions a frost in the Eighth Month.
[marginal note] Although we have had very much hot, dry weather after a heavy shower about the 22 Eighth Month, they say there was frost. Job Scott takes notice of a frost in the Eighth Month as something like a threatening. How many ways there are to blast or bless!
<pb id="A0011531_034"/>
26 of the Eighth Month, 1819. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. I thought it was a lively good meeting throughout to my satisfaction, except answering our queries – the waters seemed low and things very dry and dull, yet there were many lively pertinent remarks. The love of this world hath wounded us, and very many are like those who have taken too much opium or anodine [anodyne], as one says, dulled with opiates. But as for the taking care of temporal interest and accomodations for the poor body, bright and lively enough, no cost or pains spared. Many now come to meeting in such painted carriages as their fathers would have been ashamed to ride in, and their testimony against pride and superfluity almost trodden under foot, which our first Friends suffered so greatly for, is almost lost sight of amongst many of this young generation. For as a dear, innocent youth said when I spoke to him about his very high, crowned, narrow brimmed hat, he cryed out, law, I did not know that anybody thought there was any harm in such things as that! And his father said it was very difficult to get any other sort. So people may go on and conform to this world contrary to that express command: be not conformed to this world <note resp="transcr">Romans 12:2</note>   and yet persuade themselves they are the follower of Christ and very good Christians. But as our ancients used to say, surely will not the Lord visit for these things.
28. Pinching, dry weather. The little rains seems but like dews, soon gone, and there seem like to be but very few potatoes or buckwheat, but do not know. This night, a fine rain again like an eastwardly storm. See Psalms 32: 9th verse: be ye not as the horse or the mule, which hath no understanding. See the worldling and the drunkard – how degraded below the brutal part of the creations, and how many of such degraded beings there are, like Remus, embraced the present world. I have known several who have said they did want a better Heaven than what they had here in their earthly enjoyment. And as William Penn says, they would never leave them if they could help it and have their way <note resp="transcr">William Penn, <italic>No Cross, No Crown.</italic></note>  . I think there is good instruction in what an old drunken man said to his neighbor, who asked him to go with him to look at his meadow, which was heavy loaded with the choicest of grass. Walking amongst it, the old drunkard said: well, I should not like to have such meadow as this. The other says: No? Why? 
<pb id="A0011531_035"/>
Why, if I had, I think I should not be willing to die and leave it and I think you won’t be willing to leave it. The love of this world operates like opium or annodine [anodyne], stupifies and besots and – as the Scriptures says – drowns people in destruction and perdition <note resp="transcr">1 Timothy 6:9</note>  . And how many captives and victims there are who are snared in these two traps, drunkenness and worldly mindedness? If drunkenness has slain its thousands, may it not be said that earthly mindedness has slain its ten thousand? Have not many degraded themselves beneath the brutal part of the creation? As I heard a worthy Friend once tell his drunken brother, thou art worse than the brute beasts. So like the heath in the desert know not when good cometh <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 17:6</note>  , the ox knows his owner and the ass his master’s crib, but my people do not know nor consider <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 1:3</note>  , like the horse or the mule that hath no understanding <note resp="transcr">Psalm 32:9</note>  . They are not enamored with that blessing which makes truly rich and adds no sorrow, or with that merchandise which is better than silver and the gain thereof than fine gold.
29. First Day. We went to the burial of James Thorington’s infant child and then to our meeting. David Comfort of Byberry had acceptable service.
{1819-09}
2 of the Ninth Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting, which was in a good degree satisfactory to me. Then went to see Jacob Hollinshead, who seems near his end, near 87 years of age. Has been a very steady, examplary, constant attender of meetings as long as he was able to go. Then me my wife and Abby went to see our cousin James Thorington’s wife, whose infant child was buried last First Day. She is in a very weak, low state. There were a number of women, some old and some young ones. I had them together at last with the sick woman, which was hard to come at; full of trifling talk, but none seemed to have any concern to bring back the King. It was to my relief and satisfaction on retrospection on my bed.
[marginal note] Weather continues very hot and dry.
5 was First Day. At our meeting, which was through mercy an open, owning time to me to good satisfaction. This afternoon I attended their First Day or, as some call it, the Sunday school newly set up. About eighty children, some black ones, some young men and young women. Some quite small, but mostly about 9, 10, 12, etc. years old.
<pb id="A0011531_036"/>
The school appeared in very good order. Divers of our young Friends – several young men and young women – give up their time and attend as teachers. I had good satisfaction in being with them and encouraging them, although I think I see a better way. William Penn says reading is good, but meditation is better <note resp="transcr">Advice of William Penn to his Children</note>  . If parents were examplary and kept their children and those under their care to reading the Scriptures and other good books and above all meditating in the law of the Lord, they would find a satisfaction far transcending any other way of spending their time. William Penn says he could not wish any one better than that he was in a way of making the best use of his time, and what way can be better? See the blessings promised to it – blessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law delights to meditate both day and night and blessed are the people that are in such a case.
9th of Ninth Month, 1819. At our Monthly Meeting, which was to my satisfaction, although I think their is great room for and need of improvement in deep, solid, weightly concern. There has been frequently showers round about us, but not such heavy thunder, I think, as in summers I have known. But it is said in the news there has been much thunder and lightning in some places. A few days ago, Josiah Evan’s barn was burnt down with the lightning a few miles eastward of Moorestown, and it is said another further eastward. Likewise, these showers reach but very little ways and seem like dew soon gone, and it continues with us very pinching, opressive, hot, dry weather. The scramblers are much tried; they are hard beset to plow. It is so dry they cannot go on preparing their ground for seed corn. So we read, the plowmen hung their heads and were ashamed. If it should hold so dry a while longer, we should soon see that of ourselves we can do nothing, either in a temporal or spiritual relation.
10 I was at Evesham Monthly Meeting. A door of utterance may be opened and not a door of entrance. I had not that satisfaction as at some other times of late. In meeting for discipline things seemed low, dry, and formal: a want of life. But little room for labor, yet at last some savor.
<pb id="A0011531_037"/>
11 of the Ninth Month, 1819. [Inserted:] Now 10th of the Tenth Month I hear Benjamin White is take to the asylum at Philadelphia. We hear that Benjamin White, son of Joseph White, a worthy minister, has returned from a religious visit to England. He is under very great depression and lowness of mind, seems in great danger of loosing his reason on account of omitting some meetings which he thinks he ought to have visited. This, the second visit he has paid to England.
John Estaugh (of unblemished character) it is said was struck with a fit of the apoplexy as he was preaching at Haddonfield but survived it. Thomas Cox in England, after preaching about half an hour, was struck with a fit and died immediately in meeting. Robert Jordan, a very great minister, was struck with a fit as he was waiting for the hour of meeting at a friend’s house in Philadelphia. See <italic>Memorials <note resp="transcr">Memorials, Philadelphia, 1787</note> </italic> : several young men and one very lately I have seen have violent convulsion fits in meeting. See the many awful calls and many things that call for humility and fear. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, keeps the heart clean and preserves from the snares of death <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 14:27</note>  . And yet how much that fear is wanting!
[marginal note] What an awful call for humility in the case of Benjamin White, and many others!
15. My daughter Abigail and I went to select meeting at Haddonfield. Forepart was a poor dull time, yet I ventured to break silence and had no cause to repent it, and life did arise into dominion at last. And a downright searching, lively time it was as I ever seen, till at last we were in danger of overdoing the matter. However many lively remarks were made tending to stir up to more faithfulness.
16 was quarterly meeting. Richard Jordan was raised in very great eminence. Jacob Ritter, a Dutchman, had considerable, acceptable service. Solemnity and weight attended. And on business it was an open, solemn downright searching time, I think, as I ever seen. To my satisfaction, I was enabled to sit it out a highly favored meeting.
William Flanner of Ohio has returned from England, who went there last spring with the full unity of his friend to pay religious visit. He is a famous, well-approved minister. He was in England about six weeks; the cause of his unexpected return is not yet known.
See a little book called <italic>The Destruction of Jerusalem <note resp="transcr">George Holford</note> </italic> , page 140: the sky gathers blackness; we hear the distant thunder that forebodes the storm approaching, but no salutary dread prevails. 
<pb id="A0011531_038"/>
No radical, no general reformation is discernible; an atheistical disposition of mind, a sensualizing gaiety of manners pervades and awfully infatuates the country.
People seem to think they can get to Heaven without taking up the cross or obeying Christ’s commands. Although he said to one, if those wouldst enter into life keep the commandments <note resp="transcr">Matthew 19:17</note>  . Be ye not conformed to this world <note resp="transcr">Romans 12:2</note>   was one of his positive commands, but how is it disregarded by professing Christians, who can take their full swing in conforming to this world in all its growing pride and prevailing fashions! No cost or pains spared to gratify the lusts of the eye and pride of life. So count that command nothing. Although thousands of the Lord’s faithful servants have suffered very greatly for their testimony against pride and superfluity and chose to follow the example of their self denying Divine Master who, for our example, wore a garment without seam <note resp="transcr">John 19:23</note>  .
18 of the Ninth Month, 1819. We hear that the Yellow Fever rages in an alarming manner at Baltimore. They say seventy died there in one week. And now their yearly meeting draws near (it comes 11 of next month), and divers of our friends propose to be at it, and many strangers, great ministers from New England: Henry Hull and our cousin Henry Warrington and his companion Elias Hicks and divers others.
19 of the Ninth Month, First Day. I went to Ancocas meeting, Joseph Cowperthwaite with me. Went to see my old friend Samuel Haines, who has been very sick and yet very poorly; the visit seemed very acceptable. Then we went to their meeting, and an open, owning, favored time it was, to my sweet satisfaction. There were divers ministers from Pennsylvania: Dinah Hillis, an ancient woman, had acceptable service. John Man and Samuel Gomery were silent. Openness, nearness, kindness, and sweetness at parting. Dined at Benjamin Ridgway’s; had a good time with the family at parting with the young people and parents, then called to see an old Scotchman who is quite childish with age. Then called to see our cousin James Thorington’s wife, a blooming youth but now faded and seems near her end. Got home in good season with satisfaction.

20th Ninth Month. But as Thomas Ross said, the hardest thing ever he found in his life when he was right to keep so  <note resp="transcr">Thomas Wagstaffe, <italic>Piety Promoted</italic>, vol. 9</note> ; oh, what humility, what fear came and prayer and watchfulness it does indeed require when we are right to keep so!
If I am right, thy grace impart
Still in the right to stay; 
If I am wrong, oh teach my heart 
To find the better way. <note resp="transcr">Alexander Pope, “Universal Prayer”</note> 
See again <italic>The Destruction of Jerusalem</italic>, page 132: it is said of the Jews that they rejected and denied Christ, who promised or offered a release from the captivity of sin and Satan, a spiritual salvation and everlasting glory in heaven, and therefore he was rejected. Thus they manifested their preference of the pleasures of sense and earthly grandeur before holy enjoyments and the glories of an unseen and future world. Now what are professing Christians preferring? Is it heavenly or earthly treasures? Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:34, Matthew 6:21</note>  . How is it at this day, amidst all the great talk about religion?
22. Like for a storm: see Hosea 8th 3 verse: Israel hath cast off the thing that is good; the enemy shall pursue him. It has been said we may in general trace back our troubles till we find they originated in a departure from the paths of piety and rectitude, but not so always. Many innocent women and parent suffer grievous trouble on account of the bad conduct of their husbands and children. But they that willfully cast off the thing that is good, all religious restraint – oh, in how many sorrowful instances do we see the saying verified: on the heels of folly treadeth shame, remorse of conscience, of most bitter repentance and after too late, like Esau who sold his birthright for a mess of potage <note resp="transcr">Genesis 25:30-32</note>   and afterwards sought it with tears but could not find it. Oh, if I had begun in time! The frequent great show and signs of rain and going off with very little has caused me to think of the state of religion; great talk and great signs of religion but like clouds without rain go over and very little vital religion. I have this morning read of a class of beings who could not be affected with any thing so much as the loss of property. Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:34, Matthew 6:21</note>  .
Robert Valentine, a worthy minister, said, oh, if I had begun in time I might have been a clever fellow by this time! And also Job Thomas, a most worthy minister, often lamented his not giving up sooner to seek and serve the Lord <note resp="transcr">Joseph Gurney Bevans, <italic>Piety Promoted</italic>, vol. 9</note>  . You did not begin soon enough, said an old Negro to his young master, who was much alarmed with a cancer in his mouth. Oh, that I had embraced the opportunities I had in time to make my peace with the Lord, said a poor criminal.

See the Journal of Peggy Dow – my black man brought it here – page 87, printed 1814, wife of Lorenzo Dow when at Georgia: while we were here the earthquakes began and alarmed the people very much. It was an awful scene, to feel the houses shaking under us as sensibly as one could feel the motion of a vessel when it was moving over the water; and the trees, as it were, dancing on the hills. All nature seemed in commotion. This was enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble. But when people get so hardened that mercies nor judgments cannot move them, we may conclude they are in a bad or dangerous way. These earthquakes were sensibly felt here in Jersey and in our neighborhood. Clocks, it said, were stopped in divers places and there was accounts in the news of light shocks of earthquakes were felt in many places from Georgia through Virginia, and a long way through the western territories. John Rutty in his diary mentions an earthquake that shook England, Ireland, France, perhaps Spain and Germany! Fear ye him who can terribly shake the earth and has many times done it and many thousands have perished by earthquake in a few minutes. If I be a master, where is my fear? If I be a father, where is mine honor? <note resp="transcr">Malachi 1:6</note>   And yet how very little of this there is, to what there should be.
[marginal note] About 1814.
23. Ninth Month, 1819. Fifth Day morning. A stormy, rainy night. I think we have not had such a one [of] these Sixth Months or more.
See again Peggy Dow’s Journal, page 112: 
How tedious and tasteless the hours,
When Jesus no longer I see.
Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flowers 
Have all lost their sweetness to me.
The midsummer sun shines but dim; 
The fields thrive in vain to look gay – 
But when I am happy in him,
December as pleasant as May. 
His Name yields the richest perfume, 
And sweeter than music his voice. 
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice. 
I should were he always thus right 
Have nothing to wish or to fear – 
No mortal so happy as I; 
My summer would last all the year. 

Thomas à Kempis says while Jesus is present all things are pleasant. His kindness is better than life, said David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 63:3</note>  . In his presence is fullness of joy <note resp="transcr">Psalm 16:11</note>   without which none can ever be happy.
<pb id="A0011531_041"/>
23 Ninth Month, 1819. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. I hardly know what was the matter; I had not that satisfaction I could wish. I fear self, self, self has some secret lurking place and deprives us of that peace which is the sum and substance of a gospel minister’s wages year and of all the laborers of every class in the vineyard. John Crook’s words on some he quoted: when the mind thinketh nothing and the body acteth nothing and the soul craveth nothing contrary to the will of the great Creator, then there is true peace and solid satisfaction <note resp="transcr">John Crook, 1617-1699, <italic>The design of Christianity testified in the books, epistles, and manuscripts of that ancient faithful servant of Christ, John Crook</italic>. London, printed by James Phillips, 1791.</note>  . But what a great thing it is to attain to this state of nothingness of self and true resignation of our own wills and say not my will, etc.
This fine rain will open the way for seeding, which many have been waiting for weeks past. The earthly-minded, like the earth worm, can get into the earth, their element, again and not much consider what is written in Scripture. Ye have taken out much and brought in little because I did blow upon it <note resp="transcr">Haggai 1:9</note>  . Ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield but an ephah <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 5:10</note>  , not considering there is one that can say our fields shall or shall not yield their increase; can open the windows of Heaven and shower down blessings till there is hardly room to contain them <note resp="transcr">Malachi 3:10</note>   or, as the prophet said, shut up heaven so that the land yield not her increase <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 11:17</note>  .
Seventh Day evening. Again, a very heavy rain thunder shower. It came down like a torrent or flood. Not the like this Sixth Months – for all summer it has come very sparingly till now. And as Job says, he withholdeth the waters and they dry up; again he sendeth them out and they overturn the Earth <note resp="transcr">Job 12:15</note>  . Our mills have been shut up for want of water till now, so that we have been forced to go 10 miles or more to get our grain ground, and much complaint of wells getting dry, etc.
26 of the Ninth Month. First Day. At our meeting. I found hard work getting along. Words and life are two things; if the dead are not raised, preaching is vain <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:14</note>  , yet at last something lively and savory. See John Churchman’s <italic>Journal</italic>, page 105: Where was at four or five meeting, most of which meetings truth seemed to be professed, but too few had the life thereof in possession, which occasions hard, dry meetings.
<pb id="A0011531_042"/>
[Part of page added]
26 of the Ninth Month, 1819. See [Thomas Clarkson’s] <italic>An Essay on Slavery,</italic>  page 102. Why does not the general conduct of men afford us a better picture? What is imprudence or what is vice but a departure from every man’s own interests? And yet these are the characteristics of more than half the world. In page 107 it is said: the cruel treatment of slaves is such that every obstacle is placed in the way of their improvement. How vastly different is our circumstance, when every means is offered for our improvement, which thousands neglect and disregard and too late cry out, oh, that I had embraced the offers and opportunities of improvement.
<pb id="A0011531_043"/>
30th of the Ninth Month, 1819. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Something more open, more owning, more savory and sweet than common – uniting, strengthening, and satisfactory. The rain, for many months past, has come very sparingly, but now very freely. A few days ago, it was so dry we could not sow our seed corn, and now so wet some cannot sow. The fields, meadows, and lanes have been scorched brown with the drought; now the grass has sprung up so that pasture looks more fresh and green than it has for weeks and months past.
It is said to be, both in town and country, a very dull time for business. Very many now out of business and are very much straitened to get bread. Some are offering to work for their victuals, and some with families of children. These are trying circumstances, and it looks likely to be more so. I don’t know who can account for these ups and downs and changes of season. I can remember when laborers’ wages in harvest time was generally 2 and 6 per day; and now, of latter years, wages has been at times and places as high as a dollar and a eleven penny bit. But so, we read in Scripture, it was formerly, and so it has been down to these days: markets some times excessive high and then again very dull and low.
I have seen an account of such great changes in our first Friends writings. John Burnyeat, a worthy minister, prophesied and told the people they had seen a time of great trial and striving, and of losing their earthly treasures. But a time would soon come wherein they would be as much tried in getting riches. And it came to pass in a wonderful manner in about twelve months, and then they fell to scuffling and scrambling after this world’s goods until they were in as much danger of suffocation as they were before of starvation. See the state of poor mankind: never safe nor satisfied, full nor fasting. Agur’s prayer was, remove from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient for me, least I be poor and steal or least I become rich and deny thee and say, who is the Lord? <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 30:8-9</note>  
Sixth Day morning. Clears up again.
<pb id="A0011531_044"/>
{1819-10}
3rd of the Tenth Month was First Day. Joseph Cowperthwaite went with me to Cropwell meeting. We called to see five families on the road and invited them to go to meeting. The first asked if there was to be any strangers there. I answered: no without it was me. We are all too much strangers to the commonwealth of Israel. The next were not at home. The next we got the man and his wife along to meeting with us. The next were not at home (I believe they take the First Day to visit their friends or relations). The next were family of people lately come from England, professing to be of the Church of England – but some of them attend Friends meeting. I asked the young man if he would go to meeting. He said no, not without there was some preaching. He said he could not bear to go and sit there and hear nothing said, and I could not promise or say there would. So we left him, but his father and four sisters went with us to meeting. And a door of utterance was opened as much so as I ever seen there; though very dull, low, and poor at first, there was openness, feeling nearness, and sweetness at last.
Then we went to see Joel Evans, an ingenious young man in a deep consumption. Had a pretty sweet opportunity with him, then went to see Eli Evans, my sister’s son, who has most grievously given way to strong drink. Has a valuable wife and seven fine children. We had them together; his wife’s mother happened to be there, who had lately very pressingly urged me to come and see the family. I thought it was in a good degree an open, owning time to good satisfaction. Returned in peace and got home in good season. There was three families more I wanted to stop and see, but time was too short for it. One was Thomas Homes, many years afflicted with lowness and despondency of mind; another was a miserable captive to drunkenness; the other has been many years a poor abject with the palsy.
6. A friend brought me a newspaper giving an account of the dreadful eruption, disorder, revolution, and confusion in England on account of state affairs, oppressive taxes – the mob raised and dismal murdering work amongst them. See the danger people are in when and where vital religion prevails not. In said paper is this instructing remark: to be able to bear provocation is an argument of great wisdom; and to forgive it of a great mind.
Day 7 morning. See 1 of Peter – read to the end of the chapter – 2 and 19 verse: for this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience towards God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. So this is acceptable to God. But alas, alas, see for want of this forgiving inquires how has the fire of Hell kindled on individuals and whole nations, how have the potsherds of the earth dashed one against the other 
<pb id="A0011531_045"/>
and grievously tormented and destroyed one another, and made a dismal rattle in nations and ages past, even down to these our days, and as it is at this time in England, and other places.
7 of the Tenth Month, 1819. At our Monthly Meeting, I thought the forepart was lively and ended savory; that for discipline also pretty well.
8. Having some temporal business, it opened my way to get to Evesham Monthly Meeting, which was a very open, owning, strengthening, healing time to me, to sweet satisfaction on my pillow.
N.B. know, my friends, that he who best deserves my favors is he who best improves the talents I have given to him. To him and to him alone I give my honors, my power, and my riches; for he who waits with patience for my favors shall hence forth be my regent, and I never will appoint a power above him. So says the Scripture: they that honor the Lord, them will he honor <note resp="transcr">1 Samuel 2:30</note>  .
A young man, Stacy Haines, son of Evesham, on his return from Ohio came by Baltimore and says they are encamped a distance from the town on account of the prevalence of the Yellow Fever. A distressing, trying time it must be to those who are in health. How the sick fare we have not lately heard.
10. First Day morning. Last night a soaking rain again.
See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>English Reader, </italic>page 243: the influence of devotion on the happiness of life. Let us consult our experience and we shall find that the two greatest sources of inward joy, comfort, and lasting happiness are the exercises of love directed towards the most definable deserving object. As one said to this effect, I know no joys, no pleasures, no riches, no treasures comparable to that of being assured of the mercy, favor, and Love of God. His loving kindness is better than life and in his presence [is] fullness of joy, said David.
10 of the Tenth Month First Day. At our meeting. Not the poorest and lowest to me, although something was wanting. I could not get along. As Abel Thomas said, we cannot preach when we please. And as William Brown said, we do not know that ability will be given to get through with our openings. I had, as N. Waln said, considerable pertinent matter, but life and ability was wanting; although mortifying, it might be needful and profitable to keep humble.

12th of the Tenth Month 1819. This evening several of our friends and neighbors were here to see us. About 8 or 9 o’clock they went away, and as we went out there appeared a bright light in the north, with streams of vapors or streaming lights like them that appeared in the sky in the north about thirty years ago. As soon as our neighbors were gone I went to bed, but my wife and children came and earnestly desired I would get up to see a bright white cloud, about the width of a common road, in the midst of the sky right over us. It reached from east to west as far as we could see. It was quite clear star light. Such a thing to be sure of never seen before, although I have seen near eighty years. It being something so new and strange was somewat awful, and I thought displayed something like almighty power. Some undertook to assign natural causes for them lights in the north about thirty years ago, and said it was the sun shining on the great banks of ice in the north caused them northern streaming lights. But such reasons will not do for me – for if so, why not seen by us before or since until now? And now this bright narrow cloud in the midst of the sky and from east to west, something entirely new to us. Some thought it was the brightness of the light, like as of a great fire caused the white narrow cloud in the sky, some what like the rainbow. But why not ever seen so before now? I must leave as it was something supernatural. I believe many will be ready to say, with the Egyptians of old on a certain occasion said, surely the finger of God is in it <note resp="transcr">Exodus 8:19</note>  . Perhaps we may have to think of it again.
14. Fifth Day. At our meeting. I don’t know what to say so middling. A lad about 16, by the name of Petit, died very sudden after eating some honey. He told them he had swallowed a bee and it is said the doctor thought it stung him in the stomach. He died in great pain and about two hours illness. He had lived with Darling Conrow, and died at Joseph Brown’s. Oh, how many ways there are for people to be taken away! But one way to come into this world, but many ways to go out of it. What solemn calls to all sorts.
[marginal note] See [Holford’s] <italic>Destruction of Jerusalem</italic> page 36 and 37: fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven, many of which are there mentioned, before the destruction of Jerusalem.
See Luke 21:11 verse.
<pb id="A0011531_047"/>
17th of the Tenth Month, 1819. First Day. I had a meeting at Joseph Brown’s, in a neighborhood about two miles south, [with] about twenty families that seldom ever pay any attention to religion of any sort. Having obtained liberty of our Monthly Meeting, [and] I having requested Edwin Atley, a minister of Philadelphia, to bear me company, which he freely did, and had acceptable service. The forepart was very poor, low, and trying. A set of people who seem to know nothing of the necessity of silent waiting, but altogether looking out for words. No preaching, nothing to be done with them. Some were such strangers to the commonwealth of Israel that they were ashamed to be seen and chose to sit in the kitchen. And I believe several families, or heads of them, have been so long out of the way of attending any places of worship that I believe they were ashamed to come. But however we were favored at last with a good degree of the evident ownings of truth, to a good degree of satisfaction.
21. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. I have no cause to repent being there, for sometimes I have been ready to obey the command of the angel, which was: Curse ye, Meroz, said the angel of the Lord. Curse ye bitterly, the inhabitance [inhabitants] thereof, because they come not up to the help of the Lord, to help of the Lord against the mighty  <note resp="transcr">Judges 5:23</note> , etc. The subject was on the great business of education of children:
‘Tis education forms the tender mind; 
Just as the twig is bent the tree is inclined. <note resp="transcr">Alexander Pope</note> 

etc., etc. One says the world is contaminated for want of a right care in education of children. Prepare their minds to receive the power of truth, without which they can never be happy, says John Churchman. How hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:21</note>  .
Last Fifth Day at our preparative meeting a complaint was brought against Thomas Parry, who has been with us but a few years, a native of Pennsylvania, for not paying his just debts. And it appeared Friends were disposed to make short work in disowning him, although he has been an industrious, innocent, orderly, exemplary man as far as appears. But not 
<pb id="A0011531_048"/>
have that faculty of dealing for himself as many others have; and the turning of times and things working against him, his creditors falling on him and broke him up and his plantation sold for a great deal less than he gave for it but a few years ago.
24 which was First Day. After meeting, which was but a poor, low time, I went to see Thomas Parry and had a tendering time with him; I think he shed tears, and I had satisfaction. See II Kings 4th: thy servant, my husband, is dead and thou knowst thy servant did fear the Lord and the creditor is come upon me <note resp="transcr">2 Kings 4:1</note>  .
28. Fifth Day. At our meeting. A shut up time to me, but not so to several others.
29. Went to the burial of Joel Evans, a young man in the bloom and prime of life, of a singular character – very still, quiet, industrious, and remarkably ingenious and deep sighted about accumulating wealth. There was a very large number of people, and behaved orderly. At last I had sweet satisfaction at parting at the grave. We hear that John Tatham’s wife, of Woodbury, is to be buried today. Both these died of consumption; she lingered a long time, but he languished but a short time with it.
31 of the Tenth Month 1819 First Day. At our meeting better than common; to me, open and owning, to sweet satisfaction on my pillow. I thought there was an unusual solemnity felt by all, although they might not know from whence it came or what to call it.
{1819-11}
4 of the Eleventh Month, 1819. Was our Monthly Meeting, which I thought was a lively, good meeting throughout to me. (Hinchman Haines had acceptable service.) But alas, poor we, as Abel Thomas used to say – when we are right, how unable of ourselves we are to keep so. How few bear prosperity unhurt, either in a spiritual or temporal relation. As Isidore used to say, he that grows better, let him beware lest he grow proud and vain; gladly give him a greater overthrow than his former vices, for pride is as apt to grow on our virtues as our vices. And so I find it to be true. I had need to adopt David’s petition: Restore me to the joy of thy salvation and uphold me by thy free spirit <note resp="transcr">Psalm 51:12</note>   or else down we go, old weaknesses prevail.
[marginal note] Grows very dry weather again; no rain for many weeks.
<pb id="A0011531_049"/>
7 Eleventh Month, 1819. First Day. At our meeting. As to me silent, though one had a pretty deal to say. Yet if the dead raised, it [was] hid from me; though not the poorest as to my own mind. We hear a few weeks ago that our dear, sweet, worthy minister Sarah Cresson has lost her reason again. She was so, some years ago, but got out again as bright and as acceptable as ever. It appears a family weakness.
My cousin who I went to see a few months ago, Hezekiah Stokes, my half sister Hope’s son, a young merchant at Medford, Upper Evesham, has broke and run away and left a wife and three small children. A most sorrowful circumstance. It makes me think of the words of one of our great European ministers. He said, and so it is: Rent rules over rent, ruin overtakes ruin, and desolation overtakes desolation. So it is. Oh, the trouble, sorrow, misery, affliction, disgrace, and ruin we see people bring on themselves and their friends for want of keeping to that preserving principle, the law written in the heart, the law of the spirit of life, which Paul said had set him free from the law of sin and death <note resp="transcr">Romans 8:2</note>  . Which, if obeyed, would do for all as it did for Paul.
Fifth Day. At our meeting. Lydia Lippincott had savory service, and I thought something savory attended the meeting. Afternoon, I went to see our ancient friend Jacob Hollinshead, about 87, who seems drawing near to close, but at present some better. And I went to see my old friends, Samuel Laning and wife and G. Matlack.
13. Heard of two remarkable deaths. A young man, Levi Lippincott, near Cropwell meetinghouse was digging marl and it caved in upon him and buried him alive in an instant. The other was a child about four years old below Haddonfield: got a bean in its wind pipes and it died suddenly. What instructing obsessions and warnings. One young man drowned, two died with consumption, and two with uncommon disorders in the head unsensible.
[marginal note] A young man lay dying at J.H. 21. Died after we came away.
14. First Day. A precious, open, favored, owning time it was, to sweet satisfaction.
15. Went to see my sister Hope in her troubles. Lodged at Job Collins’ and wife, my old fellow traveler, is visiting families. Weather fine and warm, like spring. 
17. A fine small shower. Heard of four or five men being shot, one designed by the others accidental – some gaming, sporting, etc. Almost daily, or very frequent, we heard of bankruptcies. Never was the like in our land.
[marginal note] Rain goes off again, and again grows very dry weather.
<pb id="A0011531_050"/>
25. Eleventh Month, 1819. At our preparative meeting. After meeting, went with William Roberts to visit one English, a young man who brought a certificate. Both were to satisfaction.
28. First Day. At our meeting. Some life and savor as I thought, but how difficult it is to retain it, as one of experience once remarked.
29 Last night a pretty smart snow, but clears up fine and warm. See a book called<italic> The Conquest of Canaan</italic>, by John Martin, page 143: All men are happy as they know and approve the true nature, the appointed means, and final end of being so and miserable as these are unknown, neglected, and despised. See again page 144: the command and credentials given to Joshua without a clever call and a good conscience. What can any man do for God? But with these, what has not been attempted, what has not been performed? An attention to God’s commands is both our duty and our strength and the only way in which the divine presence can be expected and enjoyed. Joshua was to meditate on the revealed will of God. Day and night he was to observe and do according to all that was written. He was to be what some would call obstinately right. Thus was he to be strong and of good courage. In the exalted character he sustained, and thus only can we be endued with the same courage and strength in ours. And see page 252: Evil persons make evil time, and there have been always a sufficient number of such in the world to try the patience of the upright and to manifest that those who are unholy will always be unthankful, and in proportion as they are so, will always be unhappy. Page 80th: Devotion, if genuine, will always shine in every situation and will at all times teach us benevolence and discretion. And see page 177, concerning the hardened rebellious Canaanities: what a dreadful situation are such people in, to whom every warning is despised, every caution is an offence, and to whom every entreaty is vain. deplorable state! For that which melts others into tenderness and submission fires them with rage and fills them with resentment. Unhappy men, all but themselves see their guilt and lament it, behold their approaching ruin and shudder at the thought, while they (shocking idea) rush forward to destruction with as much unconcern as the ox goeth to the slaughter or the fool to the correction of the stocks.
<pb id="A0011531_051"/>
29. Concerning the physical causes of the fertility of the land of Canaan, Socrates himself has somewhere ventured to declare that what makes objects fire is the presence or approach or communication of what he calls the original fire being. Whatever be the way of that communication – the way he observes is various and often mysterious – but the thing is certain. Let me add that persons are as dependent on the Divine Being as things. Them whom he careth for and whom his eyes are to bless and prosper from one end of the year to the other <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 11:12</note>  , they, like the land of Canaan, are more excellent than the rest. May this blessing be yours. Page 28: you must not wonder therefore that they who dishonor God are injurious to men and enemies to themselves. Page 32: I cannot forbear observing that an increase of people peaceful among themselves, intelligent, and industrious will by art and labor improve the most barren situation and make the most of what is fruitful. And these, let me tell you, are some of the solid advantages which religion diffuses wherever she is embraced. First she fertilizes the mind and then extends her benign influence to all its operations.
{1819-12}
3rd of the Twelfth Month. At our select meeting. Poor and dull, want of savor and life. Not lively and wise and knowing as in temporal affairs, yet at last I had some satisfaction. Where nothing is to be had the King must loose his right.
4. Killing some of our hogs. 4 weighed near 200 a piece. Markets very low and dull, pork 5d [pence] a pound and 4 dollars a hundred; a few years ago pork three friperry bits a pound and twelve dollars a hundred. A great stagnation of trade and business of all sorts. Who can account for these extreme ups and downs? We hear of the dreadful eruptions and increase of confusion, wars, and destruction in England on account of the oppression of taxes etc. That spirit of rebellion has spread in to France, Germany, and Spain and that in one of the capital cities in Spain the pestilence rages that near one hundred die in a day. So we read thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backsliding shall reprove thee, that it is an evil thing and bitter to forsake the commandments of Lord <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:19</note>  .
<pb id="A0011531_052"/>
5 of the Twelfth Month, 1819. First Day. At our meeting and a precious, evidently owning, open, cementing, uniting, strengthening, memorable time it was. All seemed alive with love, openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness after meeting. After meeting 3rd hour went to the burial of Jacob Hollinshead, aged about 87, a very constant steady attender of meetings. Has supported or attained good name, which Solomon says is better than precious ointment and the day of their death better than the day of their birth <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 7:1</note>  . There was a vast concourse of people and [they] behaved very orderly, becoming to [the] solemnity of the occasion. I had good satisfaction, both at the house and at the grave. He left ten children, five sons and five daughters.
9. Was our Monthly Meeting, and I am not alone in thinking it was a good meeting. Amos Hilburn of Bibery [Byberry] had sweet, acceptable service. A satisfactory meeting to me.
10. Very cold, high wind which we have had very little of this fall. I went to Mill at Haddonfield. And see [Lindley Murray’s] S<italic>equel to English Reader</italic>, page 273: it is observed by a late celebrated author that he who hopes to look back hereafter with satisfaction upon past years must learn to know the value of single minutes, and endeavor to let no particle of time fall useless to the ground. By practicing these lesson[s], many have rose to great eminence in oppositions to all the obstacles this tumultuous, treacherous world could place in their way; by daring and determing to be obstinately right at all times and on all occasions, [they] have died honored, lamented, and regretted. Page 267, Franklin: I have always set a greater value on the character of a doer of good than any other kind of reputation. He possessed the rare talent of drawing useful lessons from the commonest occurrences, which would have passed unimproved by the generality of observers. I add like the busy bee gathers honey from every flower.
12. First Day. At our meeting. A low, poor time; yet a little life. Our son Joseph and his daughter Deborah were here to see us, and [he] informs me that his neighbor John Letchworth, a minister, and his companion Isaac Pennock have returned from a very 
<pb id="A0011531_053"/>
long journey in the western territories among several nations of Indians, and as far as Kentucky. And that it has been so dry that the waters in the wilderness, where there is often great abundance, was so dried up that their horses suffered very much for want of water and that there was a disorder among their horses. Their mouth[s] and throats got sore and tongues swelled and was very catching; of which many died, and the cows and hogs catched and some people, I think he said, had died with it – and that this disorder had spread along the road near or quite to Philadelphia. There is an awful language in the voice of the signs of the times, solemn awful calls after divers ways and after divers manners. The Lord speaks once, yea twice, but man perceveth it not, said Job of old [Job 33:14]. I have called but ye have not answered; when you call I will not answer, but will laugh at your calamity and mock when your fear cometh <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 1:25-28</note>  . So we read in Scripture.
15 of the Twelfth Month, 1819. Was at select meeting at Evesham. Forepart I thought was very low and poor, but Richard Jordan got to work and seemed to raise the life. As [Robert] Barclay says, by throwing a little water in a pump and working it, it fetches up the rest.  I had at last to think of an old woman I have heard of, who said: I have got the penny and I don’t care a halfpenny for all of them. And like Robert Nesbit of New England, after he had been delivering some very close doctrine, he said; now I feel as if you could not hurt me.
16. Was quarterly meeting and very large. The house, I believe, [was] completely filled. Richard Jordan stood up nearly as soon as the meeting was settled and held it till it was time to go on business. Very large, powerful, pertinent, and lively, and at last said he thought it had been a favored, well-concluded, meeting. To me it was sweet and pleasant to think of it on my pillow.
My son Joseph informs me that Jesse Kersey, one of our very greatest ministers, lately had a fall and broke his jaw bone, but was like to get well. But see what great calls there is for humility with all sorts! Jacob Lindly, a great and worthy minister, not long ago – just after he had been preaching – powerfully was throwd [thrown] out of his carriage and broke his neck. How true is the saying no man but is liable to be reduced to poverty in a moment.
18. Killing the rest of our hogs.
<pb id="A0011531_054"/>
19. Was First Day. Having got liberty of our Monthly Meeting, I appointed a meeting at New Hopewell, about 1 miles on the way to Egg Harbor, up in the barren pine woods. There was a meeting settled there some years ago, but a number of the fore rank among them having moved to the western country, the meeting was dropt and the house has stood desolate, unoccupied some years. Friends a little time ago, met to sell the house, but some tender people agreed with them to let them have the house for a school house and to hold meetings in it if any Friends should be disposed to visit them. It was a very rainy, stormy day, which was thought to be the cause of the meeting being smaller than it might have been (many of them being poor and no carriages). Yet the house was nearly full. Forepart felt low and poor, but it growd better and I believe ended to general satisfaction. Some were very pressing, kindly inviting us to dine with them. Joseph Evans and wife and John Haines and wife – elders – were with us (that is, my daughter Abigail and me). We came on our way four miles to long a coming and dined with a new married couple, Samuel. After diner, at parting, we had a little sitting for the better, I believe. Got back to Joseph Evans’s about dark, and I very weary, but he wished that we might have an opportunity with his large family of children and servants, which I was not easy to put by although very much exhausted. The family sat down together and we fared better than I expected. All ended to good satisfaction, and we got well home.
Clears up fine and moderate. Some remarks of learned noble writer: the riches of the mind, like those of fortune, may be employed so perversly as to become a nuisance and pest instead of an ornament and support to society. <italic>Dialogues of the Dead</italic>, page 297, eddition 1765: But alas, what is distinguished ability if not wedded to integrity?
23. Fifth Day. At our meeting. A poor, mortifying time to me, and perhaps needful.
26. First Day. Came off middling.
27. Helping my son Benne kill hogs. Very fine and moderate weather.
28. Went to my son John’s, got horses shod. Grows cold.
29. I went to see Joseph Cowperthwaite, who is in a deep consumption; a young man who of latter time has been out with me at our neighboring meetings. Had a sweet satisfactory time with him.
<pb id="A0011531_055"/>
30 of the Twelfth Month, 1819. Fifth Day. At our meeting. A most violent, stormy, snowy, cold, severe freezing storm. meeting but smallish; came off without condemnation and remembered these words: if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:21</note>  . I have had some humbling, mortifying seasons of late, very gloomy prospects. [I am] ready to adopt the language of the prophet when he said, one day I shall fall by the hand of Saul <note resp="transcr">I Samuel 17:1</note>  ; myself my greatest enemy. But the clouds seem to break away.
31. Great snow and very cold.
{1820-01}
1st of the First Month, Seventh of the week, 1820. Clear and very cold. Great snow on the ground. I was thinking this morning that it is likely that millions there be [who] never will see another New Year’s Day and none knows who of us will make up one of the number. But one thing we know and that is, as Job of old says, when a few years are come I shall go the way whence I shall not return <note resp="transcr">Job 16:22</note>  . What is your life, said the apostle, but a vapor that appeareth but a very little while and soon vanisheth away [James 4:14]. And when once gone, soon forgotten, as our forefathers are. Your fathers, where are they? said the prophet <note resp="transcr">Zechariah 1:5</note>  .
2nd of the First Month, First Day. At our meeting. Evidently favored, open and owned, or I am mistaken. Oh, that I could walk worthy of such continued favors.
Second Day I went to see Joseph Cowperthwaite, who seems better. Had a pretty satisfactory little sitting in his room, and called to see Ebenezer Roberts, in a very poorly way as to his health.
3rd. Went to the burial of Mary Roughn, our next neighbor, who died very suddenly with an apoplectic fit, it was thought. A large concourse of people who were very orderly, still, and quiet. I had a satisfactory opportunity with them. All ended sweet and well. Very severe freezing weather. We hear they cross the river on the ice, and that a man from Egg Harbor it was that was overcome with the cold and died at the ferry.
6. Was our Monthly Meeting. Hinchman Haines and Lidia Lippincott had acceptable, savory service and I thought something sweet and savory attended throughout, though great room for improvement in solid weight.
We hear that our cousin Henry Warington Jr’s barn, which was very large, was all burnt down* by taking out fire to dress flax. What heavy strokes and heavy trials! And unexpected they often come, and yet how soon forgotten. The horses run away with the wagon, William Hooten’s wife in it, a few days ago, but [she] got no harm. And how many such accidents could I mention and divers, yea, numbers suddenly killed.
[marginal note] * Loss in grain and hay thought to be 1000 dollars.
<pb id="A0011531_056"/>
Henry Warrington’s loss in grain and hay and building was thought to be one thousand dollars. And now also we hear that Joseph Bonaparte – a French man, brother to Bonaparte the great French warrior – who not many years ago came here and brought very great riches, purchased lands near Burdentown and erected vast buildings, is now all burnt down from a spark from the stove, and the whole establishment consumed. How many instances there are, which evidently demonstrate the truth of that saying that there’s no man so much out of the reach of trouble but he is liable to be reduced to poverty and beggary in a moment.
9. Was First Day. At our meeting. I seemed almost left alone – Ann Edwards removed to Westfield, Ebenezer Roberts sick, I.I. [indecipherable] shut up and some others unwell. Although it was silent till near the last, it was not the poorest to me. Came off without condemnation. I count it a great favor to be so far preserved as to look back on past time with pleasure, comfort, peace, and hope.  Another snow storm.
11. We went to the burial of Samuel Stokes about seventy or upward at Moorestown, whose wife is my father’s sister’s daughter. His father, his uncle, his brother, and himself all grievously hurt themselves with strong drink there was a large gathering of people and conducted orderly and well I had a few sentences to drop at last which I hope will do no hurt to any; myself or others. I feel no cause to repent being there.
12. We now hear that Josiah Lippincott is to be buried today. He has lain long in a drearying, lingering, consumptive way. Numbers of his family or generation have gone in that way. Left, they say, eleven children. A very cold, great snow.
13. I was reading the book called <italic>New England Judged</italic>, by George Bishop of the most cruel laws and most cruel whippings, banishments, imprisoning, and hanging of our Friends, and yet how they prevailed over all their almost unheard of cruelties. What wonderful testimonies there are of men, women, and some young in years. What an alarming thing it would be if such laws were made in our days.
[marginal note] See page 37: 1650, first called Quakers. First appeared in 1644 in Leicestershire, six years before they were called Quakers.
<pb id="A0011531_057"/>
And yet it is said that some stood faithful under the deepest sufferings, who afterwards grievously fell away when tried with prosperity. I have heard it said that it is harder to stand wheedle proof than battle proof. But we seem not much alarmed at the wheedling spirit of the world, although we see many are taken in the snare and fall grievously by it. And multitudes of the dear blooming youth in eminent danger now a days, trampling upon the testimony [of] our worthy predecessors, [which they] so grievously and deeply suffered for, in compliance with divine command, which is: Let your moderation appear in all things, for the Lord is at hand <note resp="transcr">Philippians 4:5</note>   and again, be ye not conformed to this world <note resp="transcr">Romans 12:2</note>  , etc. Suffering themselves to be persuaded that they can now be very good Quakers without taking up the cross or obeying Christ’s commands, as if it was a very silly thing in our first friends to suffer so grievously for these trifling little things, as they call them in these days, and to agree and unite together! To trample on their testimony and call it nothing! But they remain to be the little foxes that crop the tender vine <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:15</note>   and buddings of truth in the blooming youth, and indeed are the seeds of desolation and at this time threaten us with desolation as to the life and power of true religion far more than the most frightful cruel laws made and most bitterly executed against our friends in New England did. For they growed and prospered in the truth under their most grievous sufferings, whilst we, under great prosperity and fullness, have too much lost the life and power of truth, which they were so evidently favored with, to the confounding their most cruel enemies and to the stopping the mouths of their greatest scoffers and gainsayers. It was a saying in the days of the martyrs that the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the church Tertullian.
But what does one of our worthy ancient say concerning prosperity? I think this was the language: Not all the persecutors or open apostates that ever rose up against us has ever done us that hurt that prosperity has done. The charge was to Israel former: when thou hast eaten and drunken and art full, then beware – as if it was the time of greatest danger. Then beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 8:10-11</note>   who had done such great things for him.
Friends first appearance in 1644. Not called Quakers till 1650. Now 1820 – 170 years since they were called Quakers in derision.
[marginal note] As the Christians were at Antioch in derision called Christians at first.

16th of the First Month, 1820. First Day. I went to our meeting, concluding [that] it would be right for me to quite shut up, and so we sat till late. Then I stood up in diffidence and fear, thinking I would only express a few sentences without I should find strength to go through, and was helped evidently to good satisfaction. Oh, what a favor continued!
17. A great storm of rain and snow together, and high wind. Of high winds we had but very little of late. Clears up fine and moderate. See [Thomas] Clarkson’s 1st volume, <italic>Memoirs [of] William Penn</italic>, page 245, in a letter to his wife just as he was going off to America: My mind is wrapped up in a saying as thy father’s: I desire not riches, but to owe nothing – and truly that is wealth and more than enough. To live is a snare attended with many sorrows. But how few in these days are much afraid of this snare, although very many are made to feel the sorrowful effects of it. As the old saying is: 
Of the love of wealth beware,
A little is enough; too much a snare.

As one of the ancients said: man wants but little here, nor wants that little long. As divers of our worthies have said and we have seen that leaving children great possessions has proved a great snare to very many, and proved a curse instead of a blessing. The prayer of Agur was: remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient for me <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 30:8-9</note>  . The middle way to every step reveal, nor let me heights of woe nor pleasure feel.
Read an account of the poor benighted Africans, now groaning under the grossest ignorance, superstition, and idolatry. What shall we render for all our benefits and blessings, both temporal and spiritual? What people are under greater obligations than we are? Be thou instructed, oh Jerusalem, lest I make thee desolate a land not inhabited, and my soul depart from thee <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 6:8</note>  . And let it be remembered that Jerusalem and Antioch were once the churches of Christ, but where are they now? So we read: oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft would I have gathered thee; but ye would not behold. She is left desolate <note resp="transcr">Luke 13:34-35</note>  .
There is a satisfaction in doing but a little good, [even] if it is only in mending shoes, which has been my employment this cold snowy weather. And making brooms.
[marginal note] * Some are starving, and [others] suffocating, smothering with abundance.
<pb id="A0011532_002"/>
20 of the First Month, 1820. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Not the poorest to me, though silent. A considerable opening if I had had command and commission and ability. Seeing and feeling the advantage of it, may I never move without it.
I think for several weeks past we have heard of burials almost daily, and sometimes two of day. Our doctors seem to have full employ, although in general it seems not a sickly time. But our country is getting very full of people, and many die with the consumption and palsy suddenly, and many aged people have lately been taken away. Joseph Witherwil of Burlington, eighty or upwards, had been a healthy man. Went to bed as well as usual, died with an apoplectic fit suddenly. A reputable friend, Josiah Foster – also of Haddonfield about eighty – has been affected with a palsy complaint of latter years. And Isaac Andrews, seventy and upwards of Evesham – all within a few days buried, and many more.
23. First Day. At our meeting. Waters but lowish; not that savor of life and evident ownings of truth as at some other times. Yet not much cause of complaint. Thou shalt follow after thy lovers, etc. <note resp="transcr">Hosea 2:7</note>   What we love best, what our desires, hearts, and affections are placed and fixed upon [is] of vast importance. The direful effects of desires misplaced, etc. Very dry still. Severe, freezing weather.
25. A few words of advice of William Penn to his friend, page 233, [Thomas] Clarkson’s 1st volume: sink down into the seasoning, [settling] gift of God and wait to distinguish between thy own desires and the Lord’s requirings. 
Same book in 1682 and 1683. Rapid improvements in building of Philadelphia and the country near it. Page 273, he says, As to outward things, we are satisfied; the land good, the air clear and sweet, the springs plentiful, and provision good and easy to be come at an innumerable quantity of wild fowl and fish. In fine, here is what an Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would be well contented with, and service enough for God – for the fields are here white for harvest. O, how sweet is the quiet of these parts, freed from the anxious and troublesome solicitations, hurries, and perplexities of woeful Europe!
<pb id="A0011532_003"/>
This was the blessed and happy state of the people in the first building of Philadelphia and in the first settling of this country. It brings to my mind that beautiful passage of Scripture where it is said: mercy and truth are met together; righteous and peace have kissed each other; truth has sprung out of the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven <note resp="transcr">Psalm 85:10-11</note>  .
But in page 274, he says: If Friends here keep to God in the justice, mercy, equity, and fear of the Lord, their enemies will be their footstool. If not, their heirs, and my heirs too, will loose all, and desolation will follow. But blessed be the Lord. We are well, and live in the dear love of God and the fellowship of his tender heavenly spirit. And our faith is for ourselves and one another, that the Lord will be with us, a king and councilor forever.
27. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. First silent as to me. J. Justice appeared in meeting for business. Report was made of the state of our schools, on which subject I had a right, satisfactory time.
[marginal note] Our committees give favorable accounts of our schools, but I fear we shall lose sight of what our schools ought to be or teachers in them.
28. I read over a book of 125 pages before 10 o’clock, very beautiful <italic>Poems</italic> by Charlotte Richardson. <note resp="transcr">Charlotte Richardson, Poems Written on Different Occasions. Kimber, Conrad, & Company, no. 93, Market street, and no. 170, South second street, 1806.</note>  Very cold again.
30. Was First Day. At our meeting, which some thought was in a good degree a favored, an open, owning time, and ended reputably. I thought there was pleasantness and feeling nearness after meeting. Very freezing, cold weather.
{1820-02}
3. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Not the poorest to me. Though silent as to me, there was a pretty deal said, and I thought it ended pretty savory.
6 of the Second Month, 1820. First Day. At our meeting. Came off pretty well, I thought. Yesterday, 5 of the Second Month, our dear Friends Henry Warrington Jr., Esther Collins, Ann Edwards, and Ann Stokes were crossing the river at Wright’s Ferry on the ice, in their wagon, and the horses and wagon broke through the ice and Esther Collins and Ann Edwards were drowned. Henry and A. Stokes were saved. Esther Collins and Ann Edwards were two of the most unblemished characters of any we have amongst us. It is near twenty years since Ann Edwards came forth among us. Esther Collins was a very lusty woman and Ann a very small woman. 
<pb id="A0011532_004"/>
Esther Collins, 68, left five children. Ann Edwards, 46, never married. They were crossing the river to Byberry to see their kinsfolks, James Thorington and his mother. Both very sick, and have been so a considerable time. This is one of the heaviest strokes to very many, and the most alarming accidents that we have heard of. Where could we have picked out any seemingly more safe from danger? Oh what need there is to be prepared to meet trials and troubles! They were here to visit us, several of them, lately, and now they, their horses and wagon all in the river under the ice!
Esther Collins was my brother Joshua’s wife. Left four sons and a daughter. She was an elder, in universal esteem amongst her Friends. Ann Edwards was a minister universally beloved.
[marginal note] No less than six Friends had remarkable dreams just before these women were drowned, so that one said, what is a-coming?
8 of the Second Month, 1820. We went to see divers of our friends under great trouble for the loss of their and our dear friends (Esther Collins and Ann Edwards). First we went to see E.C.’s daughter Rachel Roberts. Silence for a time – like that of Job of old and his friends –prevailed. Although there was such great cause of mourning, yet not without hope, for there seemed no cause to doubt but our loss was their everlasting gain. It was a sweet, solacing time. We were informed that Ann Edwards was lively and savory in her appearance in the ministry at Westfield, but a few days before they were drowned.
We then called to see Joseph Cowperthwaite, in a deep consumption. Had a pretty little time with the family, then called to see the widow Stokes, who was pulled out of the water when E.C. and Ann Edwards were plunged under the ice. We had a solemn, savory, satisfactory time with their family, then went to our cousin Benne Warrington’s and dined. And then to our cousin Henry Warrington’s who was with and had the care of our drowned, deceased friends, and lost his wagon and horses and all – all together a very dreadful, heavy stroke to him. But we had a sweet, satisfactory time together, and I do not remember when I went to bed under a feeling sense of more sweetness and peace of mind. Storm came on, and we stayed all night.
9. We went to see Josiah Lippincot’s widow, who was buried but a few weeks ago. Lidia Lippincott and Ann Quicksil was with us, and had acceptable service in the family of eleven children. All seemed to end very well. Then we went to see our cousin, Henry Warrington, who lately had his barn burnt, then got well home.
<pb id="A0011532_005"/>
10th of the Second Month, 1820. Was our monthly meeting, and a favored, open, owning, satisfactory one it was to me. Though through close plain dealing, precious was the feeling nearness and sweetness when meeting broke up. A great snow fell last night it is thought it awful, believing many poor would suffer much, as well as the beasts of the field.
11. Reading George Fox’s <italic>Journal</italic>. See page 434: All take heed of sitting down in the earth and having your minds in the earthly things, coveting and striving for the earth. For to be carnally minded is death, or brings death, and covetousness is idolatry. There is too much strife and contention about that idol, which make[s] too many go out of the sense and fear of God, so that some have lost morality, humanity, and true Christianity and charity. Therefore be awakened to righteousness and keep awakened; for the enemy soweth his tares while men and women are asleep in carnal security <note resp="transcr">Matthew 13:25</note>  . Therefore so many slothful ones go in their filthy rags and have not the fine linen, the righteousness of Christ. Again, 435: Have a care to keep down that greedy earthly mind that raveneth and coveteth after the riches and things of this world, lest ye fall into the low region like the gentiles or heathen and lose the Kingdom of God that is everlasting – but seek that first. And God knows what ye have need of, who takes care for all, both in heaven and in earth. Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gifts, both temporal and spiritual.
Yesterday, I had something to say on that of earthly mindedness, which might not go down very pleasant to all. But I do not feel uneasy about it, so I spend my time – as some say – in wasting of paper. Again see page 460, second volume, G. Fox’s <italic>Journal</italic>: What good doth all your profession of religion and the Scriptures do without life?
13. Was First Day. Three of their ministers from Burlington were at our meeting (Abigail Barker, Margaret Allinson, and Hannah Smith) and they did do beautifully, famously, and worthily. But I kept my lesson to myself, though I think it was too good to be lost. Behold, said Job: he knoweth the way that I take <note resp="transcr">Job 23:10</note>  , which was the way the Lord’s people formerly took. Upon the most secret search shall we not find they were a thinking, considering, musing, listening, harking, studying, contemplating, meditating people? Exercised in this inward home work, not loving too wander nor walking after things that did not profit, etc., etc., etc.?
<pb id="A0011532_006"/>
14 of the Second Month, 1820. My daughter Abigail and I went with Samuel Church and his wife to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting, which was large. Richard Jordan was raised in great eminence in the exercise of his most distinguished gift. After him, Elizabeth Barton appeared large in prayer, and two or three more appeared, and at last I thought there was a solemnity not commonly felt at meeting, crowned with savor and life.
I said in my heart, O, how are these people favored with manifold blessings, both spiritual and temporal! Oh, the labor bestowed upon us, to gather us as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings but they would not <note resp="transcr">Luke 13:34</note>  . All seemed sweet, loving, and inviting at parting. O, that we might be willing to be gathered not like Jerusalem, of whom it was said: O, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings <note resp="transcr">Matthew 23:37</note>  .
We have had very freezing cold weather [for] many weeks or months, and much snow. But now, 15 of the Second Month, it grows so warm winter clothes feel burdensome. And it swept away the snow and looks like spring. Although we have lately and but few days ago had so much very cold weather and much snow, yet now, 16 of Second Month, there was a shower and thunder and lightning.
17. Fifth day. We – that is, my daughters, Abigail and Hannah – set off to Westfield meeting through a very heavy rain [for] the Young Women’s Association society of the care of the poor (in which they show a lively zeal, having appointed to meet). There the waters seemed low, as they mostly do and  hardish getting a long [in the] forepart, yet it was at last an open time to good satisfaction; it was not unpleasant to think on it on my bed. At this meeting an invitation was given to the burial of Esther Collins, to meet at her son-in-law’s, David Roberts’s, tomorrow at 2 o’clock. She was found this morning about 10 o’clock in the river, just against Market Street and in the wagon body (Ann Edwards and the horses not yet found).
After meeting at Westfield we went to see Adam Riche, a poor man who who has lain several months under great affliction from a wound with a knife in his thigh when killing his hogs, and now his recovery seems doubtful.
This afternoon
<pb id="A0011532_007"/>
this 18 of the Second Month 1820, at 2 o’clock, the people met at David Roberts’s to the burial of Esther Collins. His wife’s mother and a vast concourse of people there was; seldom, if ever, so many people seen together before – Richard Jordan and divers others ministering friends, both men and women. But all were shut up in silence till we came to the grave. There, a friend of Burlington appeared in prayer. As she was drowned and had lain so long under the ice, the people seemed uncommonly anxious to see the corpse, which was preserved perfectly in its natural appearance. For I thought I [had] never seen a corpse so little changed from is natural appearance. As I thought, there was not ever that paleness usually seen in corpse or flesh shrunk with sickness, but more like one in a sweet sleep in health. The people crowding and pressing so earnestly to see the corpse left no time for stillness, quiet, and composure, and I believe was a hindrance to the solemnity, solidity, and weightiness which might have been experienced if the people’s minds had been rightly turned and rightly engaged. I have often thought at burials the time might be better employed than it often is, in so much crowding to look at the corpse.
20 was First Day. At our meeting. Large, open, owning, and satisfactory. We spent this afternoon at Josiah Roberts’s, where was divers of the near connections of Ann Edwards and Esther Collins, whose countenances were marked with deep sorrow for the loss of our and their deceased Friends. We had a sitting with them and several sympathizing letters read. Comforting and satisfactory, and it was not unpleasant to look over the day after I got to bed.
24. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting to good satisfaction, strengthening. Fine, moderate, showery, spring-like weather.
27. First Day. With the approbation of our monthly meeting, I appointed a meeting at West Chester schoolhouse. Forepart, waters seemed low and dull and trying. Without something extraordinary, how can it be otherwise expected, in the state of mind in which people come to meeting? But through evident help in the needful time it growd better, and ended to general satisfaction. I believe it was pleasant to look over the opportunities at several families.
{1820-03}
2 of the Third Month, Fifth Day. At our meeting. Elizabeth Kirk and her companions from Pennsylvania were there, and she had savory, acceptable service. All seemed to end well.
5. First Day. Elizabeth Kirk was at our meeting again; finding herself not clear, came back and had pertinent, savory service. 
<pb id="A0011532_008"/>
Richard Jordan was also there, but said nothing. It was rather a mortifying time to me, and alarming. Ready to abhor myself under some apprehension of the secret deceptions of self and Satan, the worst of all deceivers.
9th of the Third Month, 1820. Was our Monthly Meeting, and I believe there was great need of more of it in answering our queries and in handling the discipline, although by the accounts we make out, we seem to conclude all is pretty well.
We have had, a few days past, very severe cold, freezing weather, and now a very great and very cold rain, so that it froze as it fell and the ground was so covered with ice it was difficult and dangerous to walk across the yard. The fences and buildings were covered with ice and all hung with icehickls [icicles] to every rail etc. The trees were so loaded with ice that it broke off many of the tops of trees and limbs, so that the road was blocked up in divers places. Fruit trees were torn to pieces and the trees of the woods were so loaded with ice that they looked in color at a distance like a solid mass of silver, with their tops much bowed down. One of the children brought in a twig of the weeping willow not bigger than a knitting needle, but covered with ice as big as a man’s thumb. I thought it might be seen if it held on raining and freezing how easily the trees of the woods might have been destroyed, though the wind was very still. I believe the oldest man living might safely say he never seen the like. One of our trees before the meeting house door was turned up by the roots, and the tops of others in the yard almost all broke off. A token of a bowing time, say the Methodists.
12. Was First Day. Simon Gilum of Pennsylvania was there and had sweet, savory, acceptable service. A gathering solemn, covering some thought, although some were overwhelm[ed] with drowsiness. To these, an alarm was sounded.
15. Was our select meeting at Haddonfield. Charles Osborn, from the state of Ohio, a very great minister, was there and had a great deal to say. Came off middling well, though I thought life did not rise as at some times.
16. Was our quarterly meeting. Richard Jordan first, and then Charles Osborn, were both very large in testimony. The meeting large. I had some share in the labor in last meeting, and not the smallest part, but came off with satisfaction, without condemnation.
18. We went to see our cousin Eli Evans and wife. Her mother very low and weak.
19. First Day. Some covering without condemnation.
<pb id="A0011532_009"/>
20th of the Third Month, 1820. Charles Osborn, a native of Carolina or Tennessee, but now lives in the Indiana country, appointed a meeting at Moorestown and preached and prayed near two hours. And no doubt very acceptable to most or all, but I thought life and animation was wanting. Our first Friends tell of meetings where there was much tenderness and contrition, sometimes even to trembling and tears, scarcely a dry eye. But, alas, how far is our state from this! Instead of tokens of tenderness and tears, numbers could not keep awake. So it seems it is as one prophesied: it would be powerful preachers, but dull hearers. Good sermons should be as music to a sleepy man. Is it not so, as Scott says: they go to meetings and are pleased with their fine preachers but go home and remain just the same? And so it is said it was in the days of the prophet: thy voice is to them as a pleasant song of one that hath a pleasant voice; they hear thy words but will not do them; each one returns to his covetousness <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:31</note>  .
23. Was our preparative meeting. All pretty well. This afternoon at three we went to the burial of Evans Dudley, died of a typhus fever in midst of his days. Left a wife and family of young children. Hinchman Haines (just returned from a several months journey in Pennsylvania) had a pretty deal to say and [also] Ann Quicksil and myself. We dined at old Thomas Hooton’s; had a satisfactory little time there. It was satisfactory to look over the day – but alas, as Thomas à Kempis says, we are not to depend on any one disposition of mind with which we feel ourselves affected. He says this is fickle and of short duration and so it seems to be a little like the weather: calms and storms, etc.
[marginal note] Weather fine, spring-like.
26. Was First Day. At our meeting. Ebenezer Roberts out again after being confined all winter. I hope it ended pretty well and generally satisfactory.
See the writings of Hannah Moore, 8th volume, page 274: The voice of conscience is drowned by the clamors of the world. Prosperous fortunes, unbroken health, flattering friends, buoyant spirits, a spring tide of success: these are the occasions when the very abundance of God’s mercies is apt to fill the heart till it hardens it. Loaded with riches, crowned with dignities, successful in enterprises, beset with snares in the shape of honors, with perils under the mask of pleasures, then it is that the already saturated heart tomorrow shall be as this day and more abundant; is more in unison than what shall I render to the Lord. And as we read, how hard it is for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven <note resp="transcr">Luke 18:25</note>  .
See Hannah Moore, 8th volume, page 322: Every disorder, irregularity, and excess which religion prohibits is as contrary to our comfort, health, and happiness here as it is fatal to our eternal interest and should be especially avoided on the ground of natural and spiritual judgment. Again, 323: our apostle frequently includes lovers of their own selves in his catalogue of grievous offenders; he considers selfishness as a state of mind inconsistent with Christianity. Yet may we not venture to assert that among the prominent faults of our age is a growing selfishness? In a <italic>Collection of Religious Tracts</italic>, page 107, the words of William Law: That is pure unmixed idolatry that lives wholly to self and not to God, etc. 108: For self love, the greatest of all thieves, being now cast out and all that he hath stolen and hidden thus taken from him and put into the hands of Divine love, every mite becometh a large treasure, etc.
<pb id="A0011532_010"/>
30th of the Third Month, 1820. Fifth Day. At our meeting to me not the poorest. Upon the closest inspection I am capable of, I have no cause to repent being there, although I fear it is with us as William Hunt once told the people, that they looked to him to be very lazy, idle pack. I am very jealous of self deception, the greatest of all deceivers. Although we are not altogether forsaken and cast off, yet I fear we are far from being what we should be and might be, of enjoying the favors and precious fruits and effects of the Christian religion. I once heard that dignified servant of the Lord, Joseph White, once say in his public testimony that he never found that when I will did predominate in him that he ever stood rightly situated for Divine instruction. But as Young says:
What cannot resignation do?
It wonders can perform. 
That powerful charm thy will be done 
Can lay the loudest Storm. <note resp="transcr">Edward Young, “Resignation”</note>  

What wisdom to begin with it in time and not put off too late, as it is to be feared too many do. Page 104: every one, wherever he be, that liveth unto self is still under the fall and great apostasy from God. And he says, the heresy of all heresy is an earthly mind. O earth, earth, hear, O earth <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>  !
[marginal note] Very cold again.
{1820-04}
2nd of the Fourth Month 1820, First Day. A very cold snow storm snowed all day and froze smartly. I thought at first I was not well enough to go through the storm, but did get to meeting. And although smaller than common and silent as to myself, I had no cause to repent going. I heard a friend once say when he went to meeting through the most difficulty, he went to best purpose. 
An invitation to the burial of Solomon Haines of Upper Evesham, aged 93, it is said.
<pb id="A0011532_011"/>
3 of Fourth Month, 1820. Second Day morning. Snow enough to go a-sleighing. See George Fox’s <italic>Journal</italic>, volume the first, page 98: at a great meeting in the street, among the soldiers I opened unto them that all the traditions they had lived in all their worships and religion and the profession they made of the Scriptures were good for nothing while they lived out of the life and power which those were in who gave forth the Scriptures. See page 85: at a great meeting, the truth had great dominion that day so that those great men present did generally confess to it, saying that they believed this principle must go over the whole world. Daniel speaks of a stone cut out of the mountain without hands and filled the whole earth <note resp="transcr">Daniel 2:45</note>  . Again see page 87: The Lord had said unto me if but one man or woman were raised up by his power to stand and live in the same spirit that the prophets and apostles were in who gave forth the Scriptures, that man or woman should shake all the country in their profession for ten miles round.
See page 94: G.F. says, I went to Captain Sands, who, with his wife, seemed somewhat affected with truth. And if they could have held the world and truth together, they would have received it, but they were hypocrites. But alas, is it not to be greatly feared that this is the case with very many? They would receive the truth if they could have held the world and truth together, but none can serve two masters. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:24</note>  ; his servants ye are whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of righteousness unto life <note resp="transcr">Romans 6:16</note>  .
Thomas Chalkley, in his journal, tells of a meeting he had at the governor’s house on one of the islands. At the close of which, he says, the governor stood up with his Bible in his hand and said: here, if people believe the Scriptures, I am able to prove by this book that the Quakers’ principles are the most consistent with the writings of the patriarchs, prophets, and apostles of any people in the world.
George Whitefield, in his journal, says that the Quakers are the best regulated society in the world. But alas, what will all this do for us, without the immediate quickings [of] life and power of truth? As one observes, people of sound principles and bad practices are self-condemned and lie under an highly aggravated guilt. George Fox says all your profession of religion and the Scriptures is good for nothing without the life.
The weather has been very changeable. The appearance of things demonstrate it: although the icicles and the snow, the willow tree is quite green with leaves. My father once told me that the Indians used to say when they had hard winters and unfavourable seasons, the Great Spirit was angry with them. So it appears the Indians did believe in an almighty, overruling power that superintended the universe and presided over the seasons of plenty and scarcity, of health and of sickness, and of heat and of cold. When I am sick, he, if he please, can make me well and give me ease. This has been evident in many instances, in individuals, nations, countries, and cities – Sodom and others.
<pb id="A0011532_012"/>
5th of the Fourth Month 1820. It holds very cold weather, very changeable and trying, but I think it a great mercy we are so well as we are. Many and grievous are the troubles, heart-piercing scenes of sorrow all around us. We hear that John Tathams Jr.’s son of Woodbury, lost his reason a few months ago and was taken to the asylum and made his escape from there and cannot yet be found, and many other scenes of sorrow.
See Murray’s <italic>Sequel</italic>, Section X, The Benefits of Religious Restraint, page 139 : Let him who wishes for an effectual cure to all the wounds which the world can inflict retire from intercourse with men to intercourse with his Creator, etc. An excellent piece by Blair. See same book, page 145, on seeing the sun set: such is the longest day of human life or existence; before we have learned to use it, we find it at an end.
A certain writer says: the most fatal evil in the world is the sad indifference of mankind to their eternal concerns. Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end, said the Prophet <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:29</note>  .
6. Was our Monthly Meeting. I did think there was some fresh stirrings of life among us. Many pertinent remarks, yet great room for improvement. For, alas, when we compare ourselves with our worthy predecessors, how poor, how dry, how dwarfish and formal we appear!
7 and 8. Holds very cold for the season.
9. Was First Day. I wanted to go to Evesham because Charles Osborn was to be there, but I believe it was well I did not, for we had a precious, good, owning meeting at Moorestown – but seldom the like. Like a full tide, as William Hunt sometimes said, the Lord owned up. What an unspeakable mercy continued; we are upheld till this day.
11. Was Third Day. Mildred Ratcliffe from Ohio appointed a meeting at Moorestown, which was large, and she had sweet, savory, acceptable service, and I had a share in the time to good satisfaction; a good meeting.
12. A certain writer says it was an observation of an heathen moralist that no history makes mention of any man who hath been made better by riches, and I doubt if histories of a later date can give a better account, but sure I am – many have been the worse for riches. Thousands have been suffocated, smothered, drowned to death in the embraces of a smiling world, and many good men have been wounded with outward prosperity and stood in great need of being helped out of the mire and clay and cured by the cross.
13. Sixth of the week. At our meeting, Josiah Lippincott and Lidia Matlack were married. Let all things be done decently and in order <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 14:40</note>  . This, I thought, was observed; and it was an open, satisfactory time to me in a good degree. An invitation was given to the burial of Samuel Hulings, tavern keeper next the meeting house. 
<pb id="A0011532_013"/>
He died very unwillingly, they say, in the midst of his days with a short illness with the typhus fever. He has been but a few weeks well recovered of a lingering, dangerous illness. He never made any pretences to religion of any sort, had been a libertine young man and run through his estate, which was considerable. I felt no openness to attend the burial till it was time to go, and then my mind was turned that way and I could not be easy to omit going, although when ever I looked that way the words of the prophet occurred. See Jeremiah 22 and 19: He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, etc. There was not a very large number of people as is common, although in the midst of Moorestown and a tavern keeper. The people were mostly not of our society, but behaved solid and well and I had a pretty solid, open time with them to good satisfaction. I am just now told that the typhus fever is prevalent at Ohio, that three or four died lately in one week and most of them from Jersey, Evesham, etc.
15 of the Fourth Month, Seventh Day. We hear that Ann Edwards is found in the river near Kingsington. She has lain in the water ever since the 5th of the Second Month.
16. First Day. At 9, the people met at her burial at her old home in Moorestown. I had good satisfaction, both at the house and the grave, in imparting a few sentences. There was very little or no offensive smell, and they say she was very little marred, but the corpse was shut up in the coffin. The meeting was very large. Granvil Woolman and Ebenezer Roberts and Joseph Justice had a pretty deal to say, and I believe a good degree of savor and life attended, and all ended well. The drowning and sudden death of these two dear, worthy women, Ann Edwards and Esther Collins, has been the most solemn and alarming extensive call that has been known in our day, for it seemed to reach from east to west. And some think it may be of more use than if they had lived years longer, although Ann was a worthy, acceptable minister and Esther a well-esteemed elder.
Weather warmer, more spring-like. Shad, it is said, has been sold for three dollars a hundred and for three cents apiece. Yea, they say they sell them out upon trust. About four dollars a hundred was the price for shad fifty years ago. Now a few years ago, shad has sold as high as twenty dollars a hundred. What strange turns and ups and downs! Who can account for these things? Of latter years the wages of laboring people have been as high as 120 dollars a year, and from ten to fifteen or sixteen dollars a month; now good hands are hired for seven dollars a month and less. Yea, many, it is said, this last winter have offered to work for their victuals, being quite out of business. These ups and downs makes me think of John Burnyeat’s prophecy when he told Friends they had been tried with persecution, great striving, and loss of goods and worldly treasure; but the time would come when they would be as much tried getting money and earthly treasure. Which, it is said, came soon to pass and very unexpected, by such sudden changes, ups and downs we read of in Scripture.

18th of the Fourth Month, 1820. The time of our Yearly Meeting. I have, I suppose, attended our Yearly Meeting forty years or upwards, but now I am not able to go. I have been thinking of my friends there; what a time of feasting it is both, spiritual and temporal. I do not doubt but a number will be brought to the banqueting house and experience the Lord’s banner to be over them in love <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:4</note>   and have to partake of heavenly bread and of the wine of the kingdom, as I with them at times have experienced. But with very many may we not say with John Churchman, oh, how is the ancient plainness departed from and pomp and splendid appearances taken their places! And with many it is made a time of outward feasting, forgetting how it felt when the fever and English army were there, not remembering the plainness and humility of our worthy predecessors, who followed their Divine Master who wore a garment without a seam <note resp="transcr">John 19:23</note>   and dined on barley bread and fish <note resp="transcr">John 21:13</note>  . And as William Penn says, not likely there was much curiosity or delicacy in cooking them! How would many be ready to snuff up their noses to sit down to such a dinner, forgetting the example of them we read of, of whom it was said the world was not worthy of them. It is said of John the Divine that he wore a garment of goats skins, of camel’s hair, and his meat was locust and wild honey <note resp="transcr">Mark 1:6</note>  . They wandered in sheep’s skins and goats’ skins, and lived in caves and dens of the earth <note resp="transcr">Hebrew 11:37-38</note>  , having no certain dwelling place.
See Solomon’s Song: the time of singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:12</note>  . But see Jeremiah 4:25, a lamentation over Judah: he says all the birds of the heaven were fled. I can but take notice of the very great scarcity of birds and any sort, when in my young days, at this time of the year, the woods ringed with the noise of the singing of birds, very great variety of sorts, songs and noises at times and places enough to din one’s ears. But now, especially this spring, there is very few birds to be seen of any sort. And as to the frogs, we used to hear them sing in abundance very early in the spring, but now, this spring, I have scarcely heard and not seen one frog. I can but notice it when I consider how our ears used to be dinned with their singing and croaking, and of the puddles full of them. I don’t know who can account for these things, but I can but look upon it as no favorable sign or token. And the lopping and stripping off the tops of the trees and abundance of branches stripped off by the late storm and ice freezing on the trees! If there should come a time of bowing, lopping, and striping of the lofty and high-minded, it would be an alarming, humbling, and an awakening time. The Lord can bring down the stoutest individuals, and even whole nations. And were there not threatening signs and tokens of it in the general drought from east to west last summer? As it was said formerly, when thou tillest the ground, it shall not yield to thee its increase <note resp="transcr">Genesis 4:12</note>  . Many fields were cut off.
<pb id="A0011532_015"/>
20 of the Fourth Month, 1820. Very warm weather, some little rain and thunder. At our preparative meeting, which was small, many being gone to Yearly Meeting. But the meeting was a satisfactory one to me.
23. First Day. At our meeting quite as good as we commonly have. I do not perceive but it ended to general satisfaction, which I count a favor but I am longing that we should experience something like the primitive Christians. William Penn mentions, in his conclusion to his <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>, he says: I shall conclude with a short description of the life and worship of the Christians within the first century or hundred years after Christ. What simplicity, what spirituality, what holy love and communion did in that blessed age abound among them! For it behooveth as well the Grecians as the barbarians to be partakers of this absolute goodness. And further, it is reported that at their meeting houses the most part of the day was employed in worshiping God. Like David, who said: on thee will I wait all the day long <note resp="transcr">Psalm 25:5</note>  . Not get quite tired and impatient sitting an hour and half or 2 hours to wait upon him, as it is to be feared some are, and sometimes through impatience and unsettledness leave the meeting, as divers – both youth and others – have done, as if they could not endure silence. Oh, the room and need there is of improvement, although we seem not quite forsaken.
[marginal note] Weather very dry. Rain goes off like it did last summer.
I have not heard the voice of the turtledove or whippoorwill this spring, and I have seen but two frogs. I cannot say I ever seen the like before, though I have seen eighty years. Last spring there was very few blossoms on the apple trees; other fruit trees were pretty full. Now this season, fruit trees are in full bloom and all full and as white as snow with blossoms.
[marginal note] I have seen but two frogs.
We read in Scripture perhaps the word of Job: one dieth in his full strength <note resp="transcr">Job 21:23</note>   etc. We hear of three women dying very, very suddenly: one at Salem, one here in Evesham, and one in Pennsylvania. And several women, three near here, who are or have lately been very ill with disorders in the head, and some much out of their senses, and some have not long since died with it.
27. Fifth Day morning. See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Sequel</italic>, page 88: the writings of sages point out a private path of virtue and show that the best empire is self government, and subduing the passions the noblest conquest. Went to our meeting, which was very small, but I should not dare to say it was quite destitute of life, but I want to feel more of that.
Seventh Day morning cloudy and cold. See Clarkson’s <italic>Memoirs of William Penn</italic>, page 328 second volume: The great end of punishment was undoubtedly to deter or prevent others from the commission of crimes; but on the other hand, it was the great object of the Christian religion to reclaim. Christ came principally for this purpose on Earth; he came to call sinners to repentance, to restore, prevent, and reclaim. I have often told Friends [this] was for the better part of our discipline, and they only have a right to censure who have heart to help. And what is a zeal for discipline without this heart to help worth? Is it not like Paul's zeal before his conversion? An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
<pb id="A0011532_016"/>
David says: thy rod and thy staff hath sustained me <note resp="transcr">Psalm 23:4</note>  , but disciplinarians whose ill have nothing to but with the rod are like the boys with their tops, which are to be kept up only by whipping. John Rutty says: we have many zealous executioners and excommunicators; but to strengthen the weak, comfort the feeble-minded, heal the sick, and to seek that which is lost and bring back that which is driven away, they have no skill at all. And what is discipline in the hands of such, but a bare name and poor, dry formality? See the complaint against the shepherds of Israel, Ezekiel 34 and 4: nor have ye sought that which was lost etc., etc.
Edward Collins of Newtown cut his own throat, and it is said two murders there [are] connected.
30 of the Fourth Month, 1820. Was First Day. I wanted to go to Cropwell, but way did not seem to open for it, so I went to our own meeting. And I was glad I was there, for it was an open, satisfactory time at last, although the waters seemed very low forepart. How little matter it is where we are if we can but obtain an answer of peace, the pearl of great price <note resp="transcr">Matthew 13:46</note>  .
{1820-05}
2nd of the Fifth Month, Third Day. Very dry weather; rain much wanted, like last summer. It clouds up often and looks like for rain and often goes off with very little or none, I think. Solomon says: He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 11:26</note>  . Now there are stout, healthy young men strolling about like vagabonds looking for work, and can find none, and cursing the farmers because they will not employ them. It is really a pinching, trying time with many poor people. There is such a very great stagnation in business, both in town and country markets, so exceeding low that people, they say, take their meat to market – both fresh and salt – and are forced to bring it home again. Frequently of late do we hear of such things. It is strange to me to think of these great changes. But a little time ago markets and wages were so excessive high, the like was never before heard – and now so exceeding low, the like was never heard! Nor is it creditable to, tell some, undertake to account for these things but I have a jealousy that there is something in it that very few, if any, clearly see through it or the cause of it.
It is but a little while ago I thought farmers were imposed upon by laborers, giving them extortionate wages. Now many would be glad to work for their victuals, even in planting time, the most busy season. And markets, but a little time back, were so high I thought it was a shame to hear tell the prices they got for their market truck of all sorts [of] meat, both salt and fresh. And now, it is said, fifty shad were sold for a pair of fowls and for a cent a piece, and the best for four cents a piece. For a shad, year back, generally a quarter dollar a piece for the best.
4 of the Fifth Month. Was our monthly meeting. Elizabeth Collins had savory, acceptable service. Although I thought there was some misses, on the whole it was pretty well.
7. First Day. At our meeting. Moriah Embree of Trenton had acceptable service, and I came off without condemnation, which is a mercy. All seemed to end well. Had pretty little rain. Great show for rain, but it goes off again and again with but little.
<pb id="A0011532_017"/>
10th of the Fifth Month, 1820. I went to the burial of Rebecah Crispin, whose daughter is my sister Abigail son’s wife, Eli Evans. I was to see her in her illness several times, which has been long and lingering. They have of latter years gone to the Baptist meeting, which is near their house, but of late seem more turned and leaning towards Friends. There was a large number of people, I expect of divers sorts – Baptist, Methodist, and Friends, and behaved very orderly. She was buried at the Baptist’s burying ground. I had an open, satisfactory time with them, both at the house and at the grave. But the fatigue was almost more than my state of health and strength could bear, but returned in peace.
11. Was First Day. At our meeting. Although the waters seemed very low, yet at last I should not dare say there was no life nor savor with us.
14. First Day. At our meeting, idleness and poverty very prevalent. J. Justice had a good deal to say, and at last I ventured and a venture it seemed to be, as one expressed it; but was mercifully helped with ability beyond expectation, and to good satisfaction. But several grumbled because they said I held meeting too long. So it is – if meeting happens to hold a few minutes longer than common, they get quite out of humor and impatient. What would they do with such a one as Paul, who continued his speech till midnight? <note resp="transcr">Acts 20:7</note>   And how far are they from David’s state, who said: on thee will I wait all the day long? <note resp="transcr">Psalm 25:5</note>   Or like the primitive Christians William Penn tells of, who spent most of the day at their religious devotions? In the afternoon I visited both the boys’ and the girls’ First Day school. About forty scholars in each and divers black boys and girls. To good satisfaction, but almost overcome with the fatigue and feebleness.
18. Was Fifth Day. At our meeting. Rather smaller, I thought, than common – but I hope and believe favored with some savor and life, though great room and need of improvement. It has been cloudy and cold and stormy several days. Rain comes very gently but now at last it comes down pretty freely and plentifully, but very cold.
21. First Day. At our meeting. A poor, dry, shut-up time to me. Although we had a pretty deal of preaching, it did nothing for me. Rain, rain, rain, day and night in abundance. But a few days ago, so dry people could not go on with their business; now so wet they cannot go on with it. So it has been; sometimes the fruits of the field and labors of the husbandman have been cut off by too much rain, and sometimes by too little. Without me ye can do nothing <note resp="transcr">John 15:5</note>  , says Christ.
25. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. We had a pretty deal of preaching, but I thought not that savor of life and sweetness as at some times. We went to see a young woman in a deep consumption at Widow Stokes’s, a good degree in a state of innocency. I was there very poor.
[marginal note] No rain up in Evesham, very dusty. This evening, a little more rain.
<pb id="A0011532_018"/>
25 of the Fifth Month, 1820. Dr. Spencer of Moorestown told me there was an account in the newspapers, and he thought no doubt of the truth of it: there was eighteen men to be hanged at New Orleans this day for conspiracy and robbery at sea and murder, and one by the name of Smith. He had been acquitted within Philadelphia! Four were hanged last week at Baltimore or Charlestown for conspiracy, robbery, and murder at sea.
See a book called <italic>New England Judged</italic>, page 173: the nations of them that are saved shall walk in the Light of the Lamb. By the true faith and belief of which (as George Keith said of these two principles: of the light within and immediate revelation) the nation that now is as a barren wilderness, as to fruits of righteousness would become as the garden and paradise of God. The glory of Lebanon and excellency of Carmel would be given unto it <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 35:2</note>  , and it would become a married land and nation <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 62:4</note>   unto the Lord, and so would all other nations if they would come and walk in the Light of the Lord. Again George Keith’s words since he left Friends in page 175: The true doctrine and sense of the light within as a Divine and supernatural gift of God, given to all faithful Christians, etc., is a doctrine well-warranted by Scripture and consented to by the generality of professors of Christianity, although very many rigid, zealous Presbyterians most horribly and blasphemously deny it – contrary to express Scripture terms, many times repeated.
28. First Day. At our meeting. I thought the forepart was very low and poor, indeed. And how can it be otherwise where so much idleness prevails? In and under a sense of lowness, I at last ventured to stand up and was mercifully helped beyond all prospect or expectation, to good satisfaction. Openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness at parting. There is said one of old, that which scattereth and yet increaseth <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 11:24</note>  . I see wherein I might have done better.
29. I went with divers others to visit William Hooton on a Monthly Meeting errand. To some satisfaction.
30. Whilst we were dressing a calf for market a heavy cloud came up out of the south with heavy wind and blew down several apple trees and other fruit trees and some in the woods with heavy rain and hail. In divers places the hail broke their windows. About Moorestown, sixty pairs of glass in one house, and in several places cut down the rye very much. There was no thunder.
31. A very stormy day. Rained almost all day. I went to the burial of Hannah Haines, widow of Noah Haines (her maiden name was Thorn); my old school mate, they say about 85. Returned with peace and satisfaction.
{1820-06}
[marginal note] The hail cut down fields of rye a little east of Moorestown.
1 of the Sixth Month, Fifth Day. At our meeting. A very low, poor time, I believe, with most a time of mortification rather than satisfaction – and it may be that is the food most convenient for me. We hear more and more of the destruction by the hail.
<pb id="A0011532_019"/>
2 of the Fifth [illegible] Month, 1820. 6 Day. At our select meeting. To me, a poor low time.
3. Having some business at my son John’s, I went there and was at their select meeting at Evesham. Although things were low, yet some life. I came off with satisfaction.
See a book called <italic>The Rights of God</italic>, by Thomas Branagan, page 300, his account of Matthew Franklin in 1815, Friend of New York, how he fell down dead whilst he was preaching in meeting in an extraordinary manner. And, as I have noted heretofore, an account of Thomas Cox in <italic>Piety Promoted</italic>, how after he had been preaching about half an hour, sat down and died immediately. Jacob Lindley lately, after he had been preaching powerfully as he was going from meeting, was throwd out of his carriage and broke his neck. George Fox was seized with coldness and chill as he came out of meeting where he had been preaching powerfully and died in a short time. John Estaugh at Haddonfield, I am told, was struck with an apoplectic fit as he was preaching in that meeting but survived it and died in Tortula in his travels. And see<italic> Memorials</italic> how Robert Jordan, that great and worthy minister, was struck with a fit as he was going to meeting and died in a few hours. Is it not strange such things do not keep us more in humility and fear? First Day morning.
4 was First Day. At our meeting. To me, a poor, low time. Search for the cause: poor disconsolate; as doves without their mate; are some when left hardly clothing enough to hide our nakedness ashamed to be seen poor creatures and when a little clothed can hardly keep from pride and enough humble.
8 was our monthly meeting. Hinchman Haines was there, and Mariah Embree from Trenton, and both had acceptable service; and the meeting for discipline well-conducted, lively, and satisfactory. Came off without condemnation. See  <italic>Memoirs of William Penn</italic>, by Thomas Clarkson, volume 2nd, page 122, an extraordinary account of the death of his eldest son, Springet Penn. Well worth preserving and reading. Weather fine – warm and growing.
11 was First Day. [Thomas] Branagan, in his book (page 251), quotes some words of Cicero, an heathen philosopher: In a word, the universal, immutable, and eternal law of all intelligent beings is to promote the happiness of one another, like children of one father, observing the universal law of all nations – that of doing as we would be done by. But, alas, how has this law been violated in the dismal destructive ways amongst men, and yet justified by professing Christians!
Then went to our meeting, and a precious, owning, strengthening one it was to me. Oh, what a mercy continued to this day! What shall we render, etc.?
12. Second Day I was invited to attend the burial of Mary Quicksil, wife of Jonathan, who has lain long in a decaying, lingering way. She was a descendant of old Ephraim Tomlinson, a worthy friend. It was a rainy day and the company not very large but very orderly. Came off middling – not that evidence of life and ownings of truth as at some times, yet not much cause of complaint. There were many moral, formal professors, and they abound in our day.
<pb id="A0011532_020"/>
14 of the Sixth Month, 1820. 4 of the week. At select meeting at Evesham, but low water with us. Yet I had some satisfaction.
15. Was quarterly meeting. Forepart, I think, was but low and poor. But that great man and dignified minister, Richard Jordan, rose up and was raised in great eminence, indeed, in the exercise of his most distinguished gift; generally allowed to be one of the greatest ministers in America. He preached a great deal and very excellent in the last meeting. But alas, what good does it do? Where is the fruit of his labor? The ointment of his right hand betrayeth itself <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:16</note>  . Really, is not this wanting among us?
18. First Day. Thomas Davis of Piles Grove, Salem County was there and preach[ed] one hour and a half some reckon and it was thought did worthily and famously. He has come forward not many years ago. And James Emlen’s wife – from Pennsylvania, near Westtown school – spoke very lively at last meeting, held half an hour longer than common. But if instrumental means are made use of for our help, it is intended to turn our minds towards their employer, so that in time we should have no need of them. But alas, as that great minister William Hunt once said, it was deeply discouraging to see so little good fruits of ministerial labors. As was said to the prophet, they hear thy words but will not do them. <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 33:31</note>  .
22. Fifth Day. At our meeting. But small weather, very warm, many very drowsy. It was hard to stem the powerful current and prevalency of it, yet through mercy I did come off with some satisfaction and clothing. I did not feel afraid of being had up or called to an account thankfulness. See William Smith’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 89: for that which makes people all happy and every condition sweet is to answer the light of Christ Jesus in their consciences. So to be single to the light is a joyful state, and none to be had without it.
25. First Day. At our meeting. Not satisfactory to me, although it seemed to be to some. A very heavy thundershower and heavy rain southward, but not much here. Very dry, hot weather.
29. Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and poor, yet ended to my satisfaction. Oh, how do many – now, as formerly – sacrifice to their nets and drags, making gods of them! And what can they do for them? At last they will be willing to cast them to the moles and to the bats <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:20</note>  ; [they] afford no help in the time of greatest need.
{1820-07}
2nd of the Seventh Month, 1820. First Day. At our meeting. Joseph Justice had a good deal to say. Thomas Matthews of Philadelphia was there but said nothing. To me the meeting ended satisfactory. Heard of three burials: James Robertson, the great tanner in Moorestown, and Thomas Buzby, and a child.
<pb id="A0011532_021"/>
This 2nd of the Seventh Month, 1820, First Day. My daughter Abigail borrowed John Gratton’s journal, I having had a sight of it many years ago and have lately enquired after it. This afternoon and Second Day morning before 8 o’clock, I read it through, containing 224 pages. And [a] precious piece of work it is, giving an account how strangely and wonderfully he was convinced, raised up, carried, or led through this world of dangers and troubles to a blessed and happy end at last. And of his great labors in the work of the ministry, and his being instrumental to the convincement of very many, and of his preaching four hours at time at divers times, and of the great growth and spreading of truth in them days, and the blessed, glorious meetings they often had! Oh, what a pity that the professors of that same blessed principle should loose sight of it after the Lord has raised up such worthies and they have suffered so much, and purchased our privileges at so dear a rate – even the loss of property, liberty, and life itself! Many died in prisons for their testimony. See English Reader XV: The wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation [and] peace; the fool, when he gains that of others.
6 of the Seventh Month. Was our Monthly Meeting I was happy in that I did gain my own approbation, for the meeting was to my satisfaction. Although the weather was very hot and dry and many tried with drowsiness. Midst of harvest many worked hard, and, as Thomas Ross says when overwearied nature calls for rest. I wonder our Monthly Meetings are favored as they are, although great room and need of improvement. 
7. Very hot, dry weather. Height of harvest, but I can do nothing at it. But yet favored much with health beyond many of my age, a little turned of eighty. See <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic>, page 15, on degrees of nearness, union and communion with God. He says (to this effect) that every truly religious, sanctified soul has communion with God. And do not the Scriptures throughout abundantly confirm it? He says: to be permitted to have communion with God is like sitting down with the king to the feast made by him for the joy of his chosen. So we read, one said: Let me hear thy voice, for thy voice is sweet and thy countenance is comely <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:14</note>  . And again says another: I sat under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:3</note>  . But, alas, how tasteless are these things to very many who never want to think of anything of the sort, but are careful about many things and neglect the one thing needful. But the joy of true religion, he says, excels the worlding’s gladness as far as light excels darkness, and the joy of it akin to the joy of the saints in glory, heavenly bread, true peace. Again, see do, page 168, on the excellency of grace and the entrancing excellency of it. 169: let gold be the portion of the miser’s, honor to the ambitious; pleasure to the voluptuous; but let grace be mine. For thus my afflictions are sweeter than the prosperity of the wicked, my reproaches preferable to the applauses of a giddy world, and my very death more desirable than the life of the most splendid, if impious, monarch.
<pb id="A0011532_022"/>
9th of the Seventh Month, 1820, First Day. At our meeting, which I thought was very destitute of life, and it seems as if it would be quite destitute of words till late. At last I had to express a few words, and then another and another, a little and a little, and I thought it ended with some degree of savor. I have thought we have mostly dull, heavy, poor meetings in harvest time, especially when it is such very hot, dry weather as it is now.
Second Day. Finished reaping what we left on Seventh Day. Harvest very good, but ours was a good deal tangled with the hail storms. What a mercy it was no worse destroyed!
See John Churchman’s journal, page 191, at a meeting at Bristol. He queried with them thus: Are you sound in faith and practice? I was led to set forth that to profess and acknowledge even sacred truths without a life of self denial, with[out] an answerable honest conduct, was no way sufficient, that being a dead faith, which produceth no good works in him who saith he believeth, showing what stumbling blocks the nominal professors are, who by their example plainly manifest that they are not professors of what they profess to have and are the greatest enemies the truth hath; which I was doubtful was the case with some among them. I had peace in this plain dealing. Alas, is it not to be feared that vital religion is at a very low ebb, and that dry formality abounds in very many meetings, very destitute of the life and power of truth? These things rightly considered. Had not professors of our principles and tenders of meeting need to tremble least they become the greatest enemies the truth hath? What can meditate more against the cause we profess to espouse than to see people at meeting overwhelmed with dullness and drowsiness? 
13. At our meeting. Very dull and poor indeed, as I thought. Weather very hot and dry and dusty. Dust almost hid the horses on the road. Some said they never seen the like. I was so unwell I was hardly able to sit meeting. Just the finishing of harvest and by accounts a greater, finer harvest there has not been many years. One farmer, it is thought, will have fifteen hundred bushels; A. Hulings and another, a thousand a [stem?] and it appears to be well filled, full grain. See John Woolman’s <italic>Caution to the Rich</italic>, page 23: the frequent use of strong drink works in opposition to the celestial influence on the mind. This is plain: when men take so much as to suspend the use of their reason and though there are degrees of this opposition, and a man quite drunk may be farthest removed from that frame of mind in which God is worshiped, we read that men may be drunk and not with wine or strong drink, but pleasures or the intoxicating spirit of this world, which unfits him for divine worship and works as strong drink, in opposition to the celestial influence on the mind. Be ye not as the horse or the mule that hath no understanding, said the prophet David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 32:9</note>  . A man drunk or besotted with the love of this world are not in a capacity to receive the advantage of the inspiration any more than a mule.
<pb id="A0011532_023"/>
This 13 of the Seventh Month, Fifth Day. Now a very fine, soaking rain after three or four weeks of very hot, dry weather. I fear we are too much like the horse or the mule David speaks of that have no understanding, no gift or capacity, to consider divine favors and mercies, but like it is said of the hog, who eats the fruit under the tree but never looks up from whence the fruit comes from. Be ye not as the horse or the mule that hath no understanding <note resp="transcr">Psalm 32:9</note>  .
See Stephen Crisps’ <italic>Epistle</italic> concerning the present and succeeding times, page 7: for a day cometh that truth will look into the fig tree for fruit, and leaves will not defend it from the curse and blasting. Poor miserable creatures, we are [it] seem[s] never safe, full nor fasting. If we are blessed and favored to live in fullness, then [there is] the danger of becoming overwhelmed with a spirit of ease and lukewarmness – which David Hall says is as bad as open profanity – and our blessings become curses. Woe unto them that are at ease in Zion <note resp="transcr">Amos 6:1</note>  . Were they not threatened punishment that were settled on their lees and sat down at ease? <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 48:11?</note>  
See <italic>Memorials</italic>, page 344: Sarah Morris says if they are but preserved from gross evils and go on in prosperity, they sit down at ease and think all is well. But Oh, that they may not too late find their mistake and that they have pleased themselves with favors they have unthankfully received and so stop short of greater, by not desiring them. As Lady Guion says, make temporary heavens here, and as William Penn says: Like them so well they would never leave them if they could help it. But William Penn says dives  he must go the story is as true as sad. I could name several who lived in great prosperity, who said they did not wish for any better heaven. Ingratitude is said to be not one of the least of sins.
See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Power of Religion on the Mind</italic>, page 83, shall ingratitude to man be looked upon as the blackest of crimes, and not ingratitude to God? Shall an injust[ice] offered to the king be looked upon in the most offensive light, and yet no notice taken when the King of Kings is treated with indignity and disrespect?
16. First Day. At our meeting. Idleness, trifling dangerous indifferency, and lukewarmness abound; on which subject I had a few sentences to mention, which afforded good satisfaction. This afternoon, I – with others, men and women friends, on an appointment of our Monthly Meeting visited John Lippincott’s family (who lately came from Philadelphia) to some satisfaction.
20. Fifth Day. At our meeting small, very destitute of life and power. I fear many know not what it is or hardly look or long for it or expect it. Oh, formality!
21. It looks like wet weather coming. See <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic>, page 62: one thinks least on what he loves last. Oh mournful conclusion, that I love God least since he is least in my thoughts! As the Scriptures say, of some God is not in all their thoughts <note resp="transcr">Psalm 10:4</note>  , and what is it to be done with those who forget him? As William Penn says, poor man minds nothing less than that which he should most mind. It is an easy matter to think on that we love best.

22 of the Seventh Month, 1820. On Seventh Day, 4 hour, we went to the burial of Mary Roberts, daughter of Joseph Roberts, near about fifty. An innocent body, never married. She died with the dropsy. A large number of people, decent and orderly. Hinchman Haines was there, but there was nothing said. I thought I had pertinent matter for the people, but waters were so low, [I had] no ability to get along at the grave. Though late in the day, I had a few sentences to satisfaction. I thought it was a shame we should be so poor for want of a willingness to work after so much has been done for us.
23. First Day. At our meeting. To me, open, owning, and satisfactory – better than common or some others, as well as I, was mistaken. Harvest and hay nearly over, I believe. Barns here away were seldom, if ever, better filled. See [James Meikle’s] <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic>, page 174: Finally, if God be the portion of his saints, why such a struggle to fill their coffers with perishing things, and why so disquieted if they do not succeed? A friend, A.M. from Pennsylvania, tells me it is reported that there is vast quantities of old wheat up the Susquehanna River that it might be had for half a crown a bushel. Two dollars and upward has been the price years past! And it is said rye is brought down the river in great quantities and sold for three shillings a bushel. J. Hollinshead, a man not very zealous for religion, once came to borrow some wheat off his neighbor, where I happened to be. I told him I thought he used to raise wheat to sell. “Why so I did, but you know the crops fail sometimes.” I said “O, yes.” He said, “It should be so sometimes or else we should forget there was any God.” One mentioned the great price wheat was sold for. He cried out, “O, I should be afraid to ask such a price for fear I should have none next year!” “O, I would not take the sin on my soul to ask such a price,” said another on a like occasion. Extortion, covetousness, and oppression are numbered all along amongst the blackest of crimes. When thou buyest ought of thy neighbor or sellest ought to thy neighbor, ye shall not oppress one another <note resp="transcr">Leviticus 25:14</note>  . Thou hast death by oppression, thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbor by extortion. Can thine heart endure or thine hand be strong in the day that I shall deal with thee? <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 22:12-14</note>  
26. Finished getting hay (grow[s] dry again). As far as I can learn, it is general a healthy time, both in the city and country. But our country is getting full of people, and our doctors still seem to have full employ. A fine rain again.
27. Fifth Day. At our meeting. So poorly I was hardly able to sit meeting or get home. Had a spell of vomiting and very sick stomach, but soon got better. Our daughter came from market and tells how low cheese, butter, and eggs and all things are and meat of all sorts. [People] have to bring it back; no sale at all for it. Her mother said, “I never heard the like, though near eighty.”
[marginal note] We hear tell of the hail [that] lately destroyed fields of Indian corn near Woodstown. It must have been very violent to destroy Indian corn now it is got so big.

{1820-07}
Self the greatest deceiver and greatest thief and greatest enemy. This morning, 14th of the Seventh Month, 1820, something opened on my mind respecting selfishness or a selfish spirit. See Mark 8th chapter 34 verse: And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them “Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me: and glorious the fruits thereof.” See Isaiah 28 and 15: and under falsehood have we hid ourselves, and direful the effects. 2 of Timothy, 3 and 2: Men shall be lovers of their own selves, and woeful the effects. A certain writer, I think Fletcher, on self knowledge says: Of all imposters, self-deception is the greatest. See John Woolman’s <italic>Caution to the Rich</italic>, page 43: holding treasure in the self-pleasing spirit is a strong plant, the fruit whereof ripens fast. A day of outward distress is coming, and divine love calls to prepare against it. Again, see J. Woolman, page 37, to the rich: when our eyes are so single as to discern the selfish spirit clearly, we behold it the greatest of all tyrants. So he considers and concludes that all the persecutions and dreadful oppression of the African race and all the destructive desolating wars as the effects and fruits of a selfish spirit, far surpassing all the power of the greatest tyrants.
Thomas Chalkley, I think, calls it cursed self. And as Alice Hays and Benjamin Lay says, a selfish spirit is Satan’s spirit. Thomas à Kempis says: know that thy own self, thy own will, hath done thee more hurt than any thing in the world, or to that effect. Anthony Benezet remarks in <italic>Carver’s Travels</italic> many thousands of miles amongst the Indians, says there is no greater or more severe reflection or stigma or reproach amongst the Indians than to say of anyone, “he loves himself.” No doubt they did see what the fruits and effects of that selfish spirit would be if suffered to grow amongst them and how contrary it was to that open, free universal spirit that breathes peace on Earth and good will to men, that is willing to live and let live and to do as they would be done by and that loves his neighbor as himself. Self is called a monster, far exceeding the greatest tyrant, although there have been tyrants that have persecuted many thousands of the righteous to death. Olery and Charron says persecution on the score of conscience has thinned the world of fifty million of human beings. See again John Woolman’s <italic>Caution to the Rich</italic>, page 37: now if we single out Domitian, Nero or any other of the persecuting emperors, the man – though terrible in his time – will appear as a tyrant of small consequence compared with this selfish spirit. For though his bounds were large, yet a great part of the world was out of his reach. And though he grievously afflicted the bodies of these innocent people, yet the minds of many were divinely supported in their greatest agonies and, being faithful unto death, were delivered from his tyranny. His reign, though cruel for a time, was soon over, and he, considered in his greatest pomp, appears to have been a slave to selfish spirit. Thus tyranny, as applied to a man, riseth up and soon has an end. 
<pb id="A0011237_02"/>
But if we consider the numerous oppressions of many states and the calamities occasioned by nations contending with nations in various parts and ages of the world and remember that selfishness hath been the original cause of them all; if we consider that those who are unredeemed from this selfish spirit not only afflict others but are afflicted themselves and have no real quietness in this life nor in futurity but, according to the sayings of Christ, have their portion in that painful condition where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched [Mark 9:44]; if we consider the havoc that has been made among mankind, in our age and in ages past, dismal – indeed, monstrous – will that selfish spirit appear to us.
That worthy minister Thomas Ross once said it is a great thing to keep self down, and indeed I have thought it was so. For I believe if we could keep self down, we should keep Satan down and that he could have no way to make an inroad upon us. To be clear of self and truly resigned is a great attainment.
What cannot resignation do? 
It wonders can perform. 
That powerful charm, thy will be done,
Can lay the loudest storm. <note resp="transcr">Edward Young</note> 

“Know thyself” is enough for man to know. “Know thyself” was a precept so much noticed amongst the Athenians that it is said that it was wrote in golden letters and set up at the corners of their streets. And I think it is Peter Charron, in his <italic>Book of Wisdom</italic>, says that in Spain (where it seems Paul once traveled) this was a proverb amongst them: Preserve me from myself, oh, deliver me from myself. And, indeed, what can be more dreadful than to be left to ourselves, as some formerly were? As it is said, he gave them over to a reprobate mind <note resp="transcr">Romans 1:28</note>  , and then what dismal fruits and effects followed. Oh, Israel, thy destruction is of thy self <note resp="transcr">Hosea 13:19</note>  . And indeed, is it not very evident now in our days, the dismal direful effects and fruits of a selfish spirit? Do we not plainly see how people cast off the thing that is good and how the enemy pursues them? And how they pursue lying vanities and forsake their own mercies, so that many live not half their days by cleaving unto wicked ways? See the effects of this selfish spirit. 
But let us consider and see the precious fruits and effects of self-denial, of those who have been willing to take up the cross of Christ, who counted nothing too near or dear to part with, although it were as a right hand or a right eye. Throughout all the accounts in Scripture, and in all ages down to these day, we may plainly see the blessed fruits and effects of a righteous life and self-denial and the blessed glorious state and happy attainments. And, on the other hand, we have seen and may clearly see – not only in individuals, but whole nations and societies – what woeful, miserable work a selfish spirit has made amongst mankind, even about religion!
<pb id="A0011237_03"/>
Hath not this selfish spirit at times made the earth to tremble? The prophet said he saw the tents of Cushan in great affliction and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:7</note>  . Hath it not been so many a time, and have we not seen it so in our days, when the potsherds of the earth <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 45:9</note>   have dashed one against another and made a dismal rattle, when they have grievously tormented and afflicted one another, endeavoring all in the power to destroy and make one another miserable. See here the fruits and effects of this selfish spirit: how different and contrary it is from that spirit which breathes peace on earth and goodwill to men <note resp="transcr">Luke 2:14</note>  .
Remember Bonaparte, that great emperor, the great French warrior? They called him an iron-hearted man because of his hard-heartedness and great cruelty in the time of his wars in Germany. See the accounts of the most dismal destruction, desolation, and ruin in the German empire, and we there may see in our days – but a few years ago – the dismal effects and fruits of the selfish spirit, whose power to oppress and distress mankind exceeds for all the power of the greatest tyrants. George Fox says when the Lord sent him out into the world to labor in his vineyard and awaken a drowsy world, the world was like a wilderness overgrown with briars and thorns, full of hissing serpents and stinging scorpions, and no right way found out of it. And the people! Many were like lions, bears, wolves, and tigers, ready to destroy him and all the sheep and lambs of Christ. Mark now and consider the fruits and effects of this selfish spirit that has brought the world and the people in it to be worse than the voracious devouring beasts of the wilderness. And we may see how in our days it has degraded many below the beast of the field, for they will only drink till they have enough, but Anthony Benezet says it is probable that a million of people destroy themselves annually by excessive drinking yearly of strong drink. See here again the direful effects and fruits of that selfish spirit, because they will not deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Christ.
See here again what this selfish spirit makes of men. See Psalms 140:3: they sharpened their tongues like a serpent. And see Isaiah 14:29: out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice; his fruit shall be as a fiery, flying serpent. See Matthew 3:7: a generation of vipers, [Matthew] 12:34, [Matthew] 23:33, Luke 3:7, and as Jeremiah 10 chapter says, as a den of dragons <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 10:22</note>  . John the Baptist and afterwards our Savior called the Scribes [Sadducees] and Pharisees a generation of vipers <note resp="transcr">Matthew 3:7 and 12:34</note>  . Isaiah 30:6: from whence come the viper and serpent? Again 41:24: your work is worse than of a serpent. And see Isaiah 59:5: they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider’s web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth; that which is crushed breaks out into viper. So here is the fruits and effects of the selfish spirit, turn saints into sinners, or make saints of sinners as in the case of St. Paul.
[marginal note] See Hosea 10:1: Israel is an empty vine he bringeth me forth fruit unto himself see not empty in making goodly image is how is it with us. 
<pb id="A0011237_04"/>
See  [James Meikle’s] <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic>, page 42, on love in God: the love of God is a fixed and unchangeable love, and the more the soul is in sorrow or distress, the more free and full are the communications of divine love. In the time of need, the world’s love will give us the slip. But in the most calamitous circumstance, sacred love performs the part of two loves and sticks closer than a brother. Mortals’ loves (alas how many can attest the truth of this) may today appear ardent and steadfast and sincere but tomorrow be entirely cold. Yea, converted into slander, hatred, and revenge. But let all the sons of God know that divine love shall be to them what the holy waters were to the prophet – ever on the increase, till it be an ocean to swim in forever. Against fears on every side this is comfort – that God will rest in his love.
Divine love is also a beneficent love. Jonathan loved David exceedingly, but could not do much for him nor save him from being expelled from his native country. But the love of God is fruitful of every blessing, is the tree that bears all kinds of fruits that nourish the soul and feasts every power. The love of poor men can bring no advantage to the persons loved. But when God sets his love upon a sinner, all at once he who had nothing of late has all things: life, liberty, friends riches, glory, a kingdom, sufficiency here and all sufficiency hereafter – in a word, all that can be named, sought after, wished for, or thought upon. Then, ye sons of earth, hug yourselves in the embrace of wealth and bless your own condition, but presume not that you are the favorites of Heaven because his common providence pours upon you. As for me, may I be the object of his love and, in spite of poverty, I am rich; in spite of sin, I am secure and walk on triumphantly to the better country. O, how very different is this love here treated as from that selfish spirit just before treated on. How precious the fruits and effects, how far transcending all earthly treasures or glory.
A certain writer says a selfish spirit is the worst companion. It has led very many into a most sorrowful, dismal state and condition, as it did the young man that would feign have filled his belly with the husks the swine had left <note resp="transcr">Luke 15:16</note>  . They that cast of the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue them <note resp="transcr">Hosea 8:3</note>  ; and they that pursue lying vanities forsake their own mercies. So it is many live not half their days by cleaving unto wicked ways. 
Seneca says: oh, ye miserable mortals, how many afflictions you do endure, which might be easily prevented. So indeed it is. What miserable vagabonds there are, poor wretched, degraded, creatures – all for want of taking up the cross to their own wills. Oh Israel, thy destruction is of thyself, but thy help is in me <note resp="transcr">Hosea 13:9</note>  . A man’s worst enemies are those of his own house <note resp="transcr">William Blake</note>  , and he that conquers himself conquers his greatest enemy. See Acts 14:16: who in time past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
He is more than a prince that rules himself,
Than he who nations keep in awe:
Who yield to that which doth their souls convince,
Shall never need another law. <note resp="transcr">Katherine Phillips, “The Soul”</note>  
<pb id="A0011237_05"/>
1820. 30 of the Seventh Month, First Day. At our meeting, and had no cause to repent being there. I believe it ended to general satisfaction. If our hearts condemn us not, then have confidence towards God, said the apostle <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:21</note>  . But, O, alas, what room and need there is of improvement!
{1820-08}
4 was Fifth Day. Instead of going to our meeting, I felt most easy to go to the burial of a little girl, about 10 years old, at Joseph Cole’s. A family brought up and professing the Church of England, a poor orphan child. I expected there would be but very few there, it being a very busy season. They buried her in the churchyard. There was but a small company, but behaved very orderly and well; and I had an open satisfactory time with them, and there was something sweet, owning, kind, and inviting at parting at the grave. Who can estimate or calculate, set a price on peace and tranquility of mind? It is to be feared very few consider the worth of it. Thy loving kindness is better than life, David said <note resp="transcr">Psalm 63:3</note>  .
Sixth Day. My wife and Hannah and I went to see Reuben Burroughs and wife and family. I have long wanted to go to see them, he being lately disowned at Haddonfield on account of a contentious lawsuit between him and his first cousin, S. Thorn, about a very little gore of land for which R. Burroughs offered to settle the matter with them for 10 dollars. But no, he said he would not buy that which was his own and so to law they went and spent 200 dollars at court and lawyers on each side and not ended yet. Verily, said Paul, there is a fault among you brother goes to law with brother <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 6:7</note>  . I had some relief and satisfaction, but no prospect of doing much, if any, good. There seemed to be no room for anything but what concerns earthly affairs. Perhaps that which is better – too little sought for by any of us or desired. <note resp="transcr">At Haddonfield Monthly Meeting, 12th Month 1819, a “testimony of disunion” was presented for Reuben Burrough who “so far departed from the good order of the Society as to act improperly in the conduct and in conversation relating to a disputed case, for which breach of order he has been deal with but not manifesting a suitable disposition of mind to make an acknowledgment the meeting came to a conclusion to disown him.”</note> 
We now hear that the fever is broke out again in town in divers places, and it is said there has been a most dreadful hail storm down about Malakee [Mullica] Hill. And Woodstown, it is said the hail stones was as big as an egg that it destroyed fields of Indian corn and killed some calves. But it reached but a little ways, a mile or two.
6 of the Eighth Month First Day morning. See the character of J[ohn]. W[oolman]. in his journal, page 273. He has given the world an instance of the possibility of living without wasting a single hour, and of the advantage of a regular distribution of time in discharging the important duties and purposes of life. Few ages have more needed such a public testimony to the value of time, and perhaps none had a more conspicuous example of the perfection to which the improvement of it may be carried.
At our meeting. To me a mortifying time because [there was] not that clothing ability, evident ownings of truth, and sweetness and savor of life as at some other times. I have been told that I am never content but in the best of pasture, and then like we read of Jesuran waxed fat and kicked <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:15</note>  . Suffocation is as fatal as starvation.
[marginal note] A most mortifying time to money mongers. They cannot sell their great quantities of pork and bacon, etc. Cucumbers, they say, are sold for five pence a bushel, and now a very great prospect of great crops.
<pb id="A0011237_06"/>
10 of the Eighth Month. Was our Monthly Meeting, to my right good satisfaction throughout.
11. Having some business that way, I was at Evesham Monthly Meeting, and a more open, owning time I hardly ever had there, strengthening. But attending meeting two days past and the weather very hot, I was almost exhausted and overcome with feebleness and weakness.
13. First Day. I am so poorly this morning I concluded I could not go to meeting. But feeling a little better after breakfast, my daughters and I went to Cropwell, where I have been talking of going weeks past. Hinchman Haines we found there. The waters to me seemed very low, but H.H. took up almost the whole time of the meeting, and I had some little relief and satisfaction at last and hope it ended pretty well. This afternoon, having the approbation of our Monthly Meeting, I appointed a meeting at the schoolhouse near the Green Tree Tavern, which ended to my sweet satisfaction. There was some most miserable, old, distressed drunkards there who showed loving and respectfull to me, although I had dealt very plain and close with them on that great and crying sin of drunkenness. It was satisfactory to look over the day.
17. Fifth Day. At our meeting. I thought rather smaller than common, yet there was something very lively stirring amongst us. Joseph Cowperthwaite, who has appeared in meeting several years at times and has lain ill last winter in a deep consumption, is got out again and looks like one arose from the dead or brink of the grave. Had very considerable to say, and divers others. I believe it ended to general satisfaction. I suppose there were some strangers from Philadelphia. They say there is now a very serious alarm on account of the prevalence of the fever. 4, it is said, died lately out of one house. One Ingle, a young man, it is said catched the disorder (a fat man) and died suddenly up Ancocas. And our neighbor Joseph Cole (where I was at the burial a few days ago of a girl) yesterday buried one of his boys with a strange disorder, which the doctor tells them is as catching as the measles, on which account they buried him without making a little, if any, invitation to his burial. The disorder, they say, has gone through the family, except the old folks. Several of their daughters have been very ill. I think they call it the Scarlet Fever, attended with sore throat. Oh, how many serious calls to a devout and holy life, after divers ways and divers manners, attended with too little effect.
<pb id="A0011237_07"/>
18. J.M. Matlack his wife and daughter paid us a visit and tells us that there two barns burnt with lightning lately in Pennsylvania – one very large, at a great tavern, and eight horses burnt in it: And I was told a few days ago there was fifty sheep killed with the thunder under a tree. I suppose these accounts are in the news.
20. First Day. I picked up a bit of an old newspaper dated April 15, 1818 (called <italic>Village Record</italic>): thus it appears that in the city and liberties of Philadelphia only, within the last 4 years 1420 persons have fallen a sacrifice by the ravages of this disorder of mankind (the consumption of the lungs) as certified by the Board of Health and signed John Allison, clerk for the years 1814, 1815, and 1816, and for the year 1817 signed Joseph Prior. From the 1st of January 1814 to the last of January 1815, 274 persons have died of the consumption of the lungs. From the first of January 1816 to the first of January 1817 to December 1817, 362 died with the consumption. It is there said it appear by the bills of mortality that more people die of consumptions and disorders in the breast and lungs than any other disorder.
20. First Day. At our meeting waters very low. Many very dull and drowsy. Amos Hilburn of Byberry was there, but it seemed as if he could or did not rise to say anything. I had a few sentences at last to good satisfaction. With leave from our Monthly Meeting, I appointed a meeting at our schoolhouse at 4th hour. A number of very raw young people who seemed to choose to stand about the door rather than come in, but we did get them in. Forepart was a very poor, stripping, trying time to me, but through mercy it growed better. Some young ministers – Joseph Cowperthwaite, Ebenezer Roberts, and Hannah Warrington – were highly favored, and I was helped beyond expectation, and a lively time it was at last, I believe to general satisfaction. There were divers there very seldom get to meeting of any sort. One of these said it was the most satisfactory meeting they was ever at in their lives.
27. Eighth Month. First Day. I have weeks past been looking towards Haddonfield, and now, with Joseph Cowperthwaite to Haddonfield. The meeting was very large, and to me the most open, evidently owing time I ever seen there. We put up and dined at a tavern, Thomas Porter’s, an old acquaintance and native of our neighborhood who kindly entertained us gratis. We had a sitting with him and wife and their ancient mother, and was at their afternoon meeting, which was very small. But we were favored to come off with good satisfaction and returned with sweet peace, although religion there is very low, trampled underfoot, kicked out of doors by very many.
<pb id="A0011237_08"/>
29 of the Eighth Month, 1820. My son Benjamin and daughters Abigail and Hannah and I went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting, which was very large. We had two of the very heads of the tribes and princes of the people: Elizabeth H. Walker of New York and Richard Jordan of Newtown, and both had most excellent service. Richard Jordan appeared in solemn supplication at last, and a solemn, highly favored time it was thought to be. I had some share in the labor in last meeting to good satisfaction, though not the smallest part.
31 was Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. It was not a very satisfactory one to me, and I hardly know the cause without it was the want of more life. Our son Joseph and his wife and son [Benjamin and Esther] were here to see us.
{1820-09}
1 of the Ninth Month at our select meeting, one of the best (almost) I can remember. However, one of our elders thought it a good meeting to me. Satisfactory. 
3 was First Day. Very low water with us till near last. I believe [it] ended with some degree of the savor of life and ownings of truth.
5. We hear of the great distress at Philadelphia. The fever, they say, rages in an alarming manner and is very mortal. They bury them, ‘tis said, in the night, and carriages going all hours of the night. People moving out and they say they are fencing up the streets. It is said the disorder is so obstinate the doctors can do nothing with it.
6. Soliloque as John Rutty says or song in the night – The fame of wisdom: Wisdom is said to be the principal thing and the merchandise of it is better than silver and the gain thereof better than fine gold. But as we read in Job, where shall wisdom be found, and where is the place of understanding? The depths saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not in me. No mention shall be made of coral or of pearl, the Topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it. It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall gold or silver be weighed for the price thereof for the price of wisdom is far above rubies <note resp="transcr">Job 28:12-18</note>  . And then see the conclusion: the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is good understanding <note resp="transcr">Job 28:28</note>  . 
But alas, how is the fear of the Lord banished in our days. The cause of truth and true religion treated as a very trifling thing, even as a fable not worth much noticing, trampled under foot and kicked out of doors with very many. Christ is said to be the wisdom of God and the power of God <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 1:24</note>  . Solomon says, see Proverbs 16 and 16 verse: how much better it is to get wisdom than gold. A house full of gold would do nothing for a dying man, but the favor of wisdom, Christ, would do all he could wish for. 19 and 8: he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul, say[s] Solomon.
<pb id="A0011237_09"/>
1820. See Ecclesiastes 8 and 1st verse: a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine. And indeed I have often thought the folly of the poor drunkard hath made their faces to look very dismal, and many others who have given way to gross wickedness; their faces are marked with a dismal appearance. But on all the vessels of the Lord’s house is this inscription: Holiness to the Lord [Exodus 39:30]. Their countenances are stamped with innocency, mildness, and benevolence.
Ninth Month, 
7. Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting we had a shower of strangers from Byberry, Pennsylvania. Sweet, worthy, amiable, able ministers: our cousin Hannah Yarnal; Amos Hilburn; Mary Walkton, a maiden; Warder Cresson a youth about 22, and they all had lively, pertinent, sweet, acceptable service. A lively, highly favored time it was, I believe.
8. My daughter Abigail and Joseph Cowperthwaite and I went to Evesham Monthly Meeting. The above named strangers were there, and cousin Hannah was raised in great eminence in the exercise of her gift, and Mary Walkton and Warder Cresson, and an open, solemn, favored time it was. I did think something of an heavenly nature did attend throughout. But oh, how are very many set down at ease and settled on their lease [lees?], although we daily hear of the language of mortality waxing louder and louder, both to the city and country. The pestilential fever prevailing in an awful manner; several lately dying raveing [raving], districted [distracted]. It is said one so much so as to bite his pillow, and another took or 4 men to keep him on his bed, here in our neighborhood.
10. First Day. At our meeting. I went as a blank, destitute of any prospect or desire of being heard – but quite the contrary. We sat so long in silence that several left the meeting, but at last life did seem to rise into dominion, and I believe it ended very savory and reputably. There were several from Pennsylvania: James Simpson, son of John Simpson, who appeared lively in the ministry. I spent several hours with him and wife at Joseph Cowperthwaite’s, and then at 4 hour went to the burial of Sarah, the wife of Samuel Matlack, who has lain some weeks or days past very ill with the gravel. Left a large family of children, mostly grown up. I had a few sentences at the grave to some satisfaction.
We have had a long spell of very dry weather; no rain this many weeks. People could not go on with sowing their rye – but now came a very soaking rain.
13. At select meeting at Haddonfield. William Foster from England was there, and Stephen Grellet, the Frenchman of New York, very lately returned from a vast extensive visit to the European nations, and divers others strangers. And we had a great deal of preaching, but yet not much animation as I thought. I could not find life to rise into dominion as at some times.

14th of the Ninth Month, 1820. Was our quarterly meeting at Haddonfield. It was very large, and to me very poor and dry and dull. But as Barclay compares the wording of the spirit to throwing a little water in a pump and working it brings up the rest, so it seemed to be. For Richard Jordan rose up with life and power and it brought a change of feeling, and then William Foster, lately from England, was large in testimony. And Stephen Grellet of New York, and very lately returned the second time from a very extensive visit to the European nations, had extensive weighty service. So it seemed to grow better and better till [at] last it was a lively, searching time, as it were, with lighted candles. Especially on the subject of putting the discipline in practice I had great relief, having been burdened and been hammering and stammering at it many years past, on account of the fullness of our answers respecting putting the discipline in practice.
17. Was First Day. At our meeting. Sort of middling, not so savory as some.
21. Fifth Day meeting morning. I am thinking of the query we have concerning becoming or unbecoming behavior at meetings, and what sort of behavior is becoming the solemnity of the occasion, and what sort of men and women ought we to be, and in what manner we should attend our religious meetings. Certainly it should be in the most humble, reverent, dependant state, as our ancestors did present their bodies, a living sacrifice, in the most reverent, humble, dependant state, even to contrition, trembling, and tears (whereby they got the name of Tremblers or Quakers) – a state very different from a trifling easy, lukewarm, indifferent state overwhelmed with drowsiness.
24. First Day. At our meeting. More life and evident ownings of truth, [which] I wanted to feel. May we never be contented or satisfied without it, lest we sit down contented in an exact form without the life. For what is the chaff to the wheat <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 23:28</note>  ?
28. First Day. At our meeting. Joseph Justice had considerable to say, and J. Cowperthwaite and I thought it did end pretty well, lively and savory at last. But Thomas à Kempis says we are not to depend on any one disposition of mind with which we feel ourselves affected, for this is fickle and of short duration. See <italic>Journal of Job Scott</italic>, the ups and the downs he had to experience, sometimes so cast down as ready to question all he had ever experienced of heavenly goodness. William Hunt and many others also.
{1820-10}
1st of the Tenth Month and 3 of the week. Went to the burial of William Roberts Junior, a very lusty, stout, tall young man, about 25 years of age. Died with the fever now prevalent; left two young children and a sorrowful widow. There was excellent outward order, but oh the need of being like minded with David, who prayed that a right spirit might be renewed within him <note resp="transcr">Psalm 51:10</note>  . Oh, the need I thought there was of more tender hearts whereon some impressions might be made, [leaves off there]
<pb id="A0011237_11"/>
[marginal note] For indeed neither mercies nor judgments seem not to have the desired effect in bring about the desired reformation. I could see but little or no signs of the inwarded life, the hidden life, the life that’s hid with Christ in God, the life of God in the soul of Man. I fear the people have lost sight of it and see nothing of the necessity of it and are set down quite easy with a mere moral righteousness, although the language of mortality and waxed louder and louder in both cities and parts of the country. I am told that a malignant fever is very mortal at the town of Savannah, and that it a very sickly time in Salem County, especially at Manington etc. This was a very stormy day. A very great rain after several weeks of very pinching, dry weather and a complaint of wells getting dry.
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness <note resp="transcr">Matthew 5:6</note>  . But we seem to be set down, quite contented with a moral righteousness, although we see we stand in need of something more when calamity overtakes us. See Acts 17:27: That they should seek the Lord if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from everyone of us. What a strange thing it would be nowadays to recommend this to the people at burials. Oh, how foreign from their thoughts or desires, although our first friends say it was their concern when they met together to feel the Lord amongst them, and oh how he did at times manifest himself among them to the opening their hearts and contriting their spirits, even to tears, so that at times there was scarcely a dry eye amongst them – although silent and not a word spoken in their gatherings. Alas, where are we, or what is the chaff to the wheat <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 23:28</note>  , the shell to the kernel? An exact decent outward form to the substance of true vital religion.
We sat in an old room with the corpse, just newly vamped up in the new mode. Very nice. I could but think of the corpse as it lay before us, and the new finished room, and how humble and contented the old people had lived in it, to my knowledge. How pride and superfluity looks when put together at these awful seasons.
Be not proud by any means;
Build not your house too high, 
But always have before your eyes 
That you were born to die.

Said the martyr: people may try the many ways, but they will never find a better than that the Scriptures point out, which is straight and narrow, low and humble. Oh, what wisdom there appears in it at the solemn, awful close.
<pb id="A0011237_12"/>
7th of the Tenth Month at our Monthly Meeting, which was large. Many strangers or from distant meetings – Thomas Matthews of Philadelphia, Hinchman Haines, and divers others. Forepart seemed to be a shut up time, especially with the strangers. In the course of the meeting I had at several times some remarks or sentences to drop, which, on considering of on my bed, I could not wish to recall – but yet so it was at last. It was a mortifying time to me, and perhaps profitable and necessary.
8 was First Day. At our meeting. To me, an open, owning, favored time. From the openness, pleasantness, sweetness, and feeling nearness that appeared in divers, I was ready to conclude it was to general satisfaction.
10. Cloudy dull wet weather. See William Smith’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 89, To such as live a single life: For that which makes all people happy and every condition sweet is to answer the light of Christ Jesus manifest in their consciences. And then – however they stand in relation to an outward state – they will have peace with God and they will possess his blessing, both inwardly and outwardly. So to be single to God in the light is a joyful state.
11. A stormy night, but clears up fine this morning. See again William Smith’s <italic>Works</italic>, page 102, Council to the Baptists: for no satisfaction or refreshment can any find, but in that life which the holy men of God were inspired with and declared the Scriptures from. So all that you make to yourselves, profit you no how like so ever, you may make it in appearance to that which the saints practised in the power.
12 was Fifth Day. At our meeting. I thought it was more lively and savory than common.
15. First Day. Ann Quicksill of Evesham was at our meeting and had sweet, pertinent, savory service – a hopeful, growing, young minister. And Lidi Lippincott also had acceptable service, and I thought it ended very well and savory, but yet not to my own peace as I could wish. Not clear of all.
17. Third Day evening. See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Sequel to the English Reader</italic>, page 181: Guard well thy thoughts; our thoughts are heard in Heaven. Dr. Young: The man is yet unborn who duly weighs an hour. Thomas à Kempis says: Oh, that I could but spend an hour after the best manner! Another says he repented of all his life long but that which he spent in communion with God and doing good.
19. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Lively enough, if it was of the right sort. Had a pretty deal said.
<pb id="A0011237_13"/>
21. Seventh Day. My old friend, about one year older than me, Jonathan Kikbrite of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and his son-in-law William Tailor, came to see me. He traveled with me when I visited the meetings in Pennsylvania about twelve years ago. They lodged with us, and very pleasant and sweetly we did seem to enjoy one another’s company.
22. First Day. They went to our meeting with us and both of them had very acceptable service, and I had some part of the time. I did think it was a good meeting and ended very savory, I believe to general satisfaction.
25. Fifth Day. Pretty lively and satisfactory, on deliberation.
28. First Day. At our meeting. Our cousin Caleb Hunt from Redstone was there, and I don’t know but it ended savory and reputably.
{1820-11}
2nd of the Eleventh Month. Joseph Cowperthwaite went with me to Cropwell meeting. There we found John Hallock of Egg Harbor. The meeting was very small and very poor and low, not seemingly in a growing state; yet they are a match for any, [I] think, in managing their worldly concerns. John Hallack, I.C., and myself had considerable to impart, and I hope pertinent. But what must it be to raise the life when it is at so low and ebb! And if the dead are not raised (preaching it is said) is in vain <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 15:14</note>  .
This afternoon I mended two pumps: one for Joseph Rogers and one for his son. Got a fall from the top of the pump and I think had like to have broke my arm, so I am now very lame in my left arm.
I picked up a little choice book, the life of Jane Pearson, see page 61, and mine eyes saw with unspeakable astonishment that we fret for things unworthy the notice of a redeemed mind, and that if I or my Friends with whom I sat were but called upon to take their leave of everything below the sun, all these perplexing anxieties would vanish like an atom in the whirlwind and be of no weight at all. We should then only lament that we had not looked above these momentary afflictions and fixed our confidence on the invisible arm and invincible power of omnipotence. But oh! how is the natural part attracted by visible objects, while that which is born from above suffers through our not adhering to the invisible.
See again Jane Pearson’s journal, page 72: In danger of being like Gideon, who after his great achievement made an Ephod and, idolizing it, the same became a snare to him. Sixth Month 30th 1802. – I was at our weekday meeting and was favored with a solemn silence, resembling that in Heaven, where angels and archangels adore in profound silence. I saw into the joys thereof; a place where sorrow cannot come: none of the inhabitants have any affliction and favored with Heavenly bread.
<pb id="A0011237_14"/>
Seventh Day. My arm is very lame with the fall from of the top of the pump. Again, see Jane Pearson’s Life, page 84: I seemed not dandled on the knee – I will bear it. For oh! I dread being at ease in Zion or trusting to anything short of what is really substantial, that feeds and nourishes the soul into everlasting life.
5 of the Eleventh Month 1820 was First Day. At our meeting. Not much satisfaction… search for the cause. I dread being at ease in Zion, say Jane Pearson. Well would it be if it was the case with all, but how natural it is, when we live in fullness, to sit down at ease and scuttle on our leas. Like the man we read of whose ground brought forth plentifully and he concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years and said to his soul, eat, drink. and take thy rest, etc. But see what a dangerous state it was, and how unwise. For it was said unto him: thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? And so shall it be with all those who say up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:19-21</note>  .
Then is it not a dangerous time? For although I have seen eighty years, I think I never seen a more plentiful season for rye, wheat, Indian corn, oats, buckwheat, potatoes, and apple in abundance, and the finest, largest, and fairest I ever seen, so that there is scarcely room to contain them or casks to hold the cider. But oh, how are these precious blessing[s] turned into a destructive, poisonous spirit, a destructive man bane blast nation stuff, as a poor drunk and called it. And how little regard is paid to that dreadful war pronounced by the prophet: to them that fuel the battle to their neighbor, the cup of the Lord’s right hand shall be turned unto thee and shameful spring shall be upon thy glory <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 2:16</note>  . 
If people were too openly declare they did not believe the Scriptures it would be no matter of wonder, they do as they do. But to profess to believe in the Scriptures and do as they do, what can be more diametrically opposite? What sort of a people were they whose root, the Prophet said, should be as rottenness and their blossom flee away as dust? And as Jane Pearson says, when they are called upon to bid adieu to their earthly idols then their fascinating schemes flee away as atoms in the whirlwind and leave them empty.
9 was our Monthly Meeting. A good meeting, I thought: open, owning, and savory and satisfactory and strengthening. Some time I feel so poor, low, and naked I do not want to speak to anybody, but rather to be hid. And at other times, openness – sweetness.
12. Was First Day. Snowed most all day yesterday, and rained very much in the night, and rainy stormy today. But I did get to meeting, which was small and but low and poor and quite shut up in silence as to myself. J.C. and E.R. unwell. Joseph Justice had something to communicate, but it ended abruptly.
We hear of a very remarkable accident or hand of providence. Mahlon Bud of Mount Holly one night was at a tavern with considerable company drinking. Stepped out to go to the necessary, which stood on the edge of the creek. He found some in the little house and went, it is said, and leaned beside the fence, which gave way and he fell into the creek and was drowned immediately. They soon missed him out of their company, searched for and found him. It is said he left one dead drunk on the floor. He bore the character of a hard drinker and great libertine. A solemn and alarming call to all.
<pb id="A0011237_15"/>
19th of the Eleventh Month, 1820. On Fourth Day Edward Brook of London Grove, Pennsylvania, appointed a meeting at Moorestown, our meeting, and had acceptable service. His testimony was much against formality, profession without possession, power and like. Hinchman Haines also had something pertinent and savory. At last something opened to me on this wise: we have read and heard much said of the fame of religion – the Christian religion, and what great things it has done for people in days of old – and we have seen even down to these days what great things religion has done for the faithful and obedient. But what hath it done for us, and what is the state of religion in our days? We have had line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little – yea, more here a great deal and there a great deal – and what hath it done for us? We are told that where much is given, much will be required. And what was to be the doom of that servant that knew his matters will and did it not? We have been an highly favored people, favored with the upper and the nether springs <note resp="transcr">Judges 1:15</note>  , favored with the dew of Heaven and the fatness of the earth (few if any more so) <note resp="transcr">Genesis 27:28</note>  . May not the language be applied to us: Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing <note resp="transcr">Luke 13:34</note>  . Why then are we not gathered, and how shall we escape if we neglect to avail ourselves of such offers of love? And will the whole world be price enough to ransom us or countervail our loss? The meeting broke up whilst I was in fear of hurting what had been said. Very fine, moderate, dry weather again.
19 was First Day. At our meeting, and a lively, open, favored time I believe it was. It affected me to see the lively, hopeful appearance of several of our youth – Hannah Warrington, Mary Matlack, and Joseph Cowperthwaite, and A.H. I did believe there was few if any but must have had a sense of something more solemn and savory than usual. A satisfactory time to me after I got to bed.
23. At our preparative meeting a lively zeal, if it was of the right sort. As James Simpson once told us at our quarterly meeting, here is a godly zeal: the shout of a king, the sword of the Lord and of Gideon <note resp="transcr">Judges 7:20</note>  .
24. I went to see Samuel Balinger on his 86th year, and found him brave – better than he was two years ago. Samuel Church went with me and he expressed great satisfaction with our visit. Then we went to see Benjamin Hopewell, in his 73rd year. He served his apprenticeship with my father. He has been greatly afflicted with a disease in his feet and ankles; had in early life given way to intemperance but is reformed from it. Then we went to see Samuel Sharp in his 91st year; he expressed gladness with our visit. Then we went to see Sibbila Duril and Rubin Haines, who have lost their reason and are 2 of the most sorrowful objects that I know of. Here away there were several others I wanted to see, but time did not admit of it. I have some months past thought of Solomon’s words: it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of mirth <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 7:2</note>  . I thought I would try it and it is not unpleasant to look back and think how I spent the day.
26th Seventh Day. Richard Bircham appointed a meeting at Moorestown and was nearly silent. He said a few words at last after holding meeting longer than common. The meeting not very satisfactory. I fear I did not stand quite clear.
<pb id="A0011237_16"/>
26th of the Eleventh Month First Day. Moderate weather at our meeting. Silent as to me, but not the poorest. E.R. and J.J. had a great deal to say, with which I find all were not altogether satisfied. It is a comfort that I was preserved from doing any harm. See Jane Pearson’s Diary, page 55: There is an active spirit… that takes its food upon the surface or catches at it flying in the airy regions. With food of this nature some seek to feed and be fed… although what was delivered through sound truths yet did not slay the man of sin. [Page] 56, she says at one meeting the season was too solemn for any vocal voice to be heard, the cloud and glory so great that none could minister. [Page] 57, she says and though I cannot say I never made one false step, yet he who knows my heart knows it to be weakness. Oh, how weak are we when divested of his saving help, etc. [Page] 58: This day I was silent; the fullness of glory too great to minister. Oh blessed state, far beyond and better than words. Then, next page, mentions the buffeting ups and downs she had to meet with.
Second Day morning. See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Sequel to the English Reader</italic>, page 130: surely that religion to which we oweth these sentiments and hope must be the greatest blessing that ever was conferred on the posterity of Adam. Again, 131: Christianity is a doctrine in which nothing is superfluous or burdensome, and in which there is nothing wanting which can procure happiness to mankind or by which God can be glorified.
29 of the Eleventh Month, 1820. Fourth of the week went to the burial of Samuel Coles of Moorestown – he was my schoolmate and playmate. Both of us in our 81st year, nearly of an age. In his youthful days he took great liberty and was very wild in his career. He got on board a man of war and was taken to England and got reduced to great poverty, yet was favored to find friends so that he got home and applied himself to industry. Married my old master’s daughter, Mary Matlack, raised up a family of children, accumulated wealth, and sustained the character of a temperate, frugal, quiet, peaceable, honest, insensitive, innocent man. There were a large concourse of people at parting at the grave. I had a few sentences to impart to the people, to peace and satisfaction of my own mind. He frequented our meetings, but never joined any religious society. Weather pretty cold.
Fifth Day. At our meeting. To right, good satisfaction.
{1820-12}
1 of the Twelfth Month Sixth day. At our select meeting a lively zeal appeared, and I hope some savor. Whilst I was making ready another and another and another stepped in, which has often been the case, so that I had not full satisfaction, although not much cause of complaint.
3. Was First Day. Came off pretty well, some say rather more life and savor than common.
4. Our little granddaughter, Bulah John’s daughter, was buried. A very stormy day. My wife nor I did not go to its burial. It was a very fine, healthy child, about two years and a half old. Died very suddenly with the hives or stoppage in its stomach. See <italic>Memoirs</italic> of Anthony Benezet, page 123.  He says: I desire to verify in myself in all cases the doctrine of one of the copies I use in my school:
Just be thy thoughts and all thy words sincere, 
And know no wish but what the world may hear.

They say of A. Benezet, he was favored to have on continually the armor of humility and protested by it none of these things exalted his depending spirit. Page 97 he speaks of the poisonous idolatry of self, so apt to creep in.
<pb id="A0011237_17"/>
7th of the Twelfth Month, 1820. At our Monthly Meeting, and if I am not mistaken an open, owning, good time it was. Many very pertinent, lively remarks were made – yet I was afraid some of our young ministers in the current over run the right landing place. 
8. Went to the burial of Samuel Laning of Moorestown, my old fellow [ap]prentice, about 4 years older than myself, about 85. He has been a very quiet, peaceable, honest man, of a good share of understanding. His only greatest failing was foolish jesting, to which he was much addicted. I went begging for preservation and resignation, and was favored to come off without condemnation, with good satisfaction in some communications to the people at the house.
This afternoon I went to see my old schoolmate Thomas Hooton, who is very poorly in his 87th year. He and his children expressed satisfaction with our visit and I had no cause to repent it.
10. First Day. At our meeting, which was large and at first very low and poor. I was ready to conclude it would be a silent meeting till at last I thought it ended very well, open and satisfactory. Very cold again.
14. Was our select meeting at Evesham, but I did not get there.
15. Was quarterly meeting. Weather warmer. We all got to quarterly meeting, which was very large. Elizabeth Barton of Newtown, a maiden of a low family, appeared and did beautifully, famously, and worthily. And Richard Jordan appeared in prayer; solemnity, savor, weight attended. A solemn time it was. In the afternoon, on the state of society as reported in the queries, a lively zeal appeared and many pertinent instructing remarks were made. I had right, good satisfaction.
18. First Day. At our meeting. The waters seemed low, I thought a good while we should have silent meeting. But at last some life and savor appeared and it seemed to end pretty well, though great room and need of improvement.
21. At our preparative meeting, which I thought was lively, open, and satisfactory. Several days dry, severe freezing weather, but extreme[ly] changeable.
24. First Day. Warmer and rain. At our meeting, not that peace and clothing  as at some times. This afternoon I, with several others, visited (according to our custom) Enoch Robert’s family, who lately brought a certificate to pretty good satisfaction. I conclude it is not worth while to make any account of any religious performances without we can obtain a reward of peace. What does all we can say, hear, see, or do avail without life and peace? As George Fox says, what good does all your profession of the Scriptures and religion do without life?
25. What they call Christmas. Dry, clear, and very cold again.
<pb id="A0011237_18"/>
28th of the Twelfth Month 1820, Fifth Day. A considerable snow storm. I did not get out to meeting, having been very unwell with a complaint in my bowels.
Last First Day Joseph Gill’s wife was buried. A young woman, left several children. He was at market the Fourth Day before she was buried. [She] got a cold and typhus fever, followed a lad, one [indecipherable], to be buried today 29 at Evesham, where it is said the scarlet fever prevails. It is a wonder such sudden deaths does not raise a concern amongst us to be prepared to leave this world. Seneca says: Oh, ye miserable mortals! The frailties of your nature are little thought of and when it is, it is in such a way it is to little purpose. I suppose to think of it to purpose we must be like minded with the prophet David when he petitioned the Lord to teach him to know his end and the number of his days, that he might know how frail he was. And again he says: Teach me so to number my days that I may apply my heart to wisdom <note resp="transcr">Psalm 90:12</note>  . This would indeed be to purpose and not otherwise.
Samuel Fothergill speaks of a way of living to the best and wisest and happiest of purpose, without which he says people had better never have lived. And those who do live to the best of purposes obtain the hope of the righteous. As the Scripture says, the righteous hath hope in his death <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 14:32</note>   and he says without this blessed hope we are of all living creatures and of all the animal creation the most miserable. For whilst man in this imperfect state of being is confined, How many pains invade his outward frame, how many sorrows vex his mind! 
Seneca further says: Oh, ye miserable mortals, how many sorrows and afflictions do you endure which might be easily avoided by daily attending to that preserving Christian principle without which we are like sheep on the mountains in the wilderness with out a shepherd <note resp="transcr">Mark 6:34</note>  , amongst briers and thorns and voracious devouring beasts, the spirits of people like wolves, bears, lions, and tigers, etc., etc. As George Fox says, when the Lord first sent him forth to labor in his vineyard to awaken a drowsy world it was like to a wilderness, and no right way found out of it. And the spirits of many were like wolves, bears, lions, and tigers, ready to destroy him and all the lambs and sheep of Christ. And will not like causes produce like effects? Are we coming up out of the wilderness, like the true church formerly and like our worthy progenitors, or are we going back into the wilderness, trampling on the testimony they so deeply suffered for?
27 of the Twelfth Month. I received a letter from my son Joseph giving an account of a gentleman from Baltimore came with his overseer to take one of his slaves about ten miles from his house at night. The slave shot his master dead and beat the overseer so that he died in a few days, for which he is now in heavy chains in Winchester [West Chester]  gaol. What dismal work amongst men, which true religion, if rightly adhered to, would easily prevent, as Seneca says.
31. First Day. At our meeting. I had to think of Job Scott, who say some meetings were open but not much satisfaction, and of David. I think he says he hideth himself and I am troubled [Psalm 30:7]. Peace is his to give or withhold. In the evening we dropt into silence had good satisfaction. So ended the year 1820.
<pb id="A0011237_19"/>
{1821-01}
4th of the First Month, 1821. Very cold, dry, hard freezing weather. Was our Monthly Meeting, the first in this year, and an open, lively time it was to my right, good satisfaction. Myself, H. Haines, Joseph Justice, and several others had a pretty deal to say, and I thought we were not destitute of life and savor attending in the afternoon. Many pertinent remarks were made tending to stir up to faithfulness. But alas what room and need there is of improvement in weightiness and solidity and wisdom.
A few days ago, an Indian near Haddonfield agreed with a black man to let him make baskets in his house. After some time, one evening, got some rum or whiskey and drinked too much. And as he slept by the fire they were very much afraid to leave him alone, but did put up the fire and went to bed. And in the night they heard him hallow and ran to him, and his clothes was all on fire. They tore them off, but he was badly burnt, but yet went again after more rum because the man had emptied his jug. The weather being very cold and he, exposing himself, got cold and died presently. Can they be clear that sell it to such poor creatures from the woe to them that put the battle to their neighbor.
11. At our meeting – a very stormy, snowy day. At our meeting, Benjamin Lippincott and Martha Collins were married. Waters seemed very low, as they mostly do forepart, but I thought growed better and ended very well.
13. Very cold, snowy winter weather. I can do little but sit by the stove and read and write, yet more favored with health than I was 6, 7, or 8 years ago. See [William] Sewel's <italic>History</italic>, page 634, the words of Anna Maria Shurman mourning because of the deadness and formality of the vulgar Christians and said within herself: “O the pride, the lusts, the vain pleasures in which Christians live! Can this be the way to Heaven? Is this the way to glory, are these the followers of Christ? O No! O God, where is thy little flock, where is thy little family that will live entirely to thee? Make me one of that number!” See here true vital religion is one and the same in all ages and nations the world over: A life of true humility, self denial, and of the cross.
14. First Day. At our meeting. Not too much satisfaction; very cold weather.
18. Fifth Day. Very cold, but I did get to meeting, and a right, lively, satisfactory one it was to me. How easy our circumstances are! Heard of the death of Samuel Haines of Ancocas, my old acquaintance. A few years younger than I, and he was here to see me a few months ago. An innocent, industrious man. What a little time it is since we were boys.
<pb id="A0011237_20"/>
23 of the First Month, 1821. We have had a long spell of very freezing cold weather, and much snow. We hear they drive over the river on the ice with wagons loaded with cord wood. Now more made [indecipherable]. I am now very poorly with my old asthma cough; have been out at meetings [in] this cold weather more than I was able to bear. Hinchman Haines and Enoch Roberts, his companion, just sat of a few days ago on a visit to some meetings on the eastern shore of Maryland, and Ebenezer Roberts and Thomas Lippincott just about to start in a visit to some meetings in Pennsylvania. May they be preserved.
25. Weather changes, more severe cold. What a pinching, suffering time it must be with very many poor, both white and black, who have very open, poor, cold houses and very scant of firewood and very scant of victuals and very scant of clothing or bedding. I think it must be a very suffering time with many in our parts, and it seems likely more so further north, where the snows are far greater and the weather colder. What a pinching time it must [be] also to the beasts of the field and wilderness and fowls of the air. But alas, how do they now drive and [indecipherable] and fly about in their sleighs in idle, unprofitable visits, unthoughtful and unconcerned how swiftly time passes away. And some hints I hear of some of whom better things are looked for are driving about from tavern to tavern and are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph <note resp="transcr">Amos 6:6</note>  . I have read accounts of some of the great ones of the earth who would have [a] human skull placed on their table at their greatest feast and idolatry to keep them in remembrance of their frailty and mortality; I have wished they had one fixed on the head of every sleigh at these times when it is to be feared their mortality is least thought of or latter end least considered, although it is evident divers have shortened their days in their sleighing frolics.
25. Fifth Day. I have had a very poorly spell several days and nights with my old asthma racking cough and not able to go out. We seldom see more cold, freezing weather when it is so still and clear.
28. About this time I went to our meeting. Very cold weather. I was taken very ill with an exceeding hard cough and fever. Sent for the doctor, I was soon reduced to the greatest state of weakness I ever remember. But I was very much favored every way, both in body and mind; I never before experienced every thing removed but tranquility of mind, humility and tenderness – even like the state of a child and that spirit which breathes peace on earth and goodwill to all. And as to my poor body, I thought my nearest connections, friends, and neighbors were like the Good Samaritan we read of, who found a man half dead and took care of him and ministered to his necessities <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:30-34</note>  . So they did for me day and night to uttermost.

{1821-04}
9th of Fourth Month, 1821. I have been confined to the house and mostly to my bedroom about ten weeks past, and have been but little out of the house. Yet although I have been favored with a good appetite, I have recovered very slow and am but feeble and tottering. Yet when I was very weak and low and all thought I must go. Many kind friends came to see me and tried to comfort and encourage me, but I was afraid my spiritual state was not so good as they seemed to think it was. For one said he had not the least doubt but all would be well if I went now, another said – to encourage me when at the worst – if thee goes now the will leave a good savor; thee has done a great deal of good in the world. Another said they had no doubt but my sufferings were nearly over, both here and forever. 
But all this will not do at such a time as this. At last as M. Haines said nothing but the Lord, nothing but [indecipherable] the Lord will do. Now although my mind was preserved pretty calm and tranquil, I wanted to feel more of the Divine Master’s sweet air that John Churchman speak of at last, and of that animating, strengthening power that Joseph White mentions at last. Oh, the wisdom there is in choosing the Lord for our portion and making him our friend who is the physician of value, who can make all our bed in our sickness and strengthen us upon the bed of languishing. Who can enable one to say although I walk through the valley of the shadow of death yet will I fear no evil <note resp="transcr">Psalm 23:4</note>  . Who said to Jacob, fear not: though thou passeth through the fire, it shall not kindle upon thee; or through the waters, they shall not overwhelm thee <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 43:2</note>  . Who preserved Daniel in the lion’s den and Shadreck [Shadrach], Masheck [Meshach], and Abednego in the midst of the fiery furnace, so that a hair of their heads were not singed nor the smell of fire upon their garments <note resp="transcr">Daniel 3:27</note>  . See 11th of Hebrews, that little book of martyrs: through faith they were favored with that [which] could stop the mouths of lions and quench the violence of fire. Out of weakness were made strong, etc. <note resp="transcr">Hebrew 11:33-34</note> .
<pb id="A0011237_22"/>
10th of the Fourth, 1821. Weather holds very cold, very little grows or vegetation in the earth. I believe, the coldest, most backward spring I ever seen. Although I am favored with a very good appetite, I remain feeble and tottering and tender about the cold.
15. First Day. At 3rd hour went to the burial of Phoebe Roberts, wife of John Roberts. She has been 15 years or more crippled and confined with the rheumatism; an innocent woman, and bore her great afflictions with great patience. This the 2nd time I have attempted to go out; once went to see this neighbor a few days before she died.
This the week of our Yearly Meeting, but I am not able to tend it. This week there was a very cold storm of rain and snow till it covered the ground and froze, so that ischickles [icicles] hung to the eaves of the house all next day. In all my late spell of sickness, I have not had any bad cold till now. I have a very heavy cold, and I observe some, at this time, of the most healthy have very bad colds.
26 of the Fourth Month. I did get to our preparative meeting, the first time since I was sick and brought so weak and low. Elizabeth Balderston was there, and I thought something savory, sweet, and satisfactory attended to the whole. Although it is clear, dry weather, the air holds cold, and I am so weak and feeble I am hardly able to go out.
29. First Day. At our meeting. If it is too much to say it was a memorable meeting, I think I may say it has been pleasant to remember it – and that is no small favor.
{1821-05}
3 of the Fifth Month, 1821. At our meeting, which I thought ended with a good degree of life and savor. A warm spell and thunder showers, but soon grows cold. We have had a very cold, backward spring. People [had] abundance of cyder [cider] to make last fall, and it made many late putting in their grain, and the winter [was] very hard. The winter grain – rye and wheat – look in many places very, very poor indeed.
<pb id="A0011237_23"/>
10 of the Fifth Month, 1821. At our Monthly Meeting, which for the most part I thought was pretty well, yet one matter was unpleasantly exercising to me. Yet for the most part , was agreeable to look at.
13. First Day. Very wet morning. I so unwell, I concluded I could not go to meeting. But our children concluded to go to Evesham, and I, having to been there a great while, I concluded to go with them, thinking it was better to wear away than rust away. And I had no cause to repent being there and I have some reason to believe nobody else had [either]; all well.
17. At our meeting. Some savor and life, I thought.
20. First Day. Our children went with me to Westfield meeting to a good degree of satisfaction. Dined with my old friends Thomas and Lydia Lippincott. My strength was very much exhausted at night. 
Fifth Day. A very stormy cold rain; I did not venture out.
28. First Day. At our meeting. Some savor, life, and ownings of truth, I hope. John Bilangee buried at our graveyard; died very suddenly. They say he was choked to death as he was eating his supper and thought he was a hard drinker.
29 at our select meeting. Not very satisfactory to me, though perhaps profitable. I think no condemnation.
{1821-06}
First Day. At our meeting poorly. I felt the effects of old and age, and understood the language of declining life. Although I had many thoughts suitable to the time and place, I had not much satisfaction. Others took the whole time, almost.
7 of the Sixth Month. At our Monthly Meeting. I think a pretty good one, not without some misses. As Thomas Ross used to say, the hardest thing ever he found in his life was when he was right to keep so. Oh, how prone we are to frailties and weaknesses as a [continued after inserted pages below]
<pb id="A0011237_24"/>
Here I turned over two leaves, so I fill up this with some words of Thomas à Kempis. See page 223: Instead of being present at my devotions where I stand or kneel, I am carried to various places, just as my roving thoughts have led me. Where my thoughts are, there I properly am; and my thoughts are chiefly with that which I most love. (Those objects too soon recur which corrupt nature or sinful habit have made delightfull.) Upon this ground it is that thou hast declared expressly that where the treasure is, there will the heart be also <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:21</note>  . And accordingly, I find in the various resolutions of my changeable heart that when I love heaven, I take pleasure in meditating on Heavenly enjoyments. When I love the world, I think on its advantages with delight and with sorrow on its troubles. When I love the flesh, my imagination wanders through its various pleasures. When I love the spirit, my faculties are with Holy joy devoted to spiritual exercises. Whatever I chiefly love, of that I delight chiefly to hear and speak and I carry home with me the diversified images it, even to my most secret retirement. 
It is said the Waldenses used to say that whatever people loved best, that was their god, that they delight to think and meditate upon. When I have sat in our meetings and seen signs, tokens, and indications of a wandering mind, I have often thought of a piece of an old Scotch song I have heard – My heart is in Highlands, my heart is not here; my heart is in the Highlands a-chasing of the deer; chasing of the buck and hunting of the doe. My heart is in the Highlands whilst the body is at meeting. No one can serve two masters; ye cannot serve God and Mammon <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:24</note>  . 
<pb id="A0011237_25"/>
I have lately had put into my hands a book giving an account of the sect called the Shaking Quakers, and it is vastly different from the account of our first Friends coming forth. Be ye not deceived was the caution formerly. It is greatly to be feared that many, very many, are greatly deceived; they think they have attained to the greatest state of Christian perfection of any people ever have done, although they [indecipherable]. They sometimes dance naked, men and women together, and sometimes are constrained, they say, to bark like a dog and make a noise like a cat. Miracles, they say, are not ceased among them, but many great miracles are done among them. Many strange imaginations they take it to be greatly feared for revelations. Some we read of who boasted they were the children of Abraham, but were told they were of their father the Devil. So we may see how possible it is for people to be greatly deceived in their spiritual or religious state, although exceedingly] confident that they are right. They forbid marriage amongst them, or men and women lying or sleeping together, or even touching one another, and find Scripture for all this grievous sorrowful work. In many instances where families have been broken up by men or women joining their society and parting when they have had families of young children – sorrowful to relate.
[Out of order] 1st of the Seventh Month, 1821. I have lately read William Law’s Address to the Clergy. A close, searching, scraping, sound piece of work. It appears to be very different from the Shakers’ doctrine.
<pb id="A0011237_26"/>
[continued from several pages earlier] As a remarkable instance of human frailties, see the 23rd of the 2nd of Samuel, the last words of David 2nd. He says the Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 23:2</note>  . Yet see the very next chapter, how grievously he missed his way in numbering the people, and what a dreadful calamity it brought upon him and his people. See 24, chapter 15 verse: there died with the pestilence seventy thousand men. What an awful, humbling lesson to the greatest and best of men – how unable, when they are right and highly favored of the Lord, to keep so. See how quickly and grievously David fell after being so highly favored of the Lord. And hath not this been the case with very many, since, as Isidore used to say, he that grows better, let him beware lest he grow proud and vain glory give him a greater overthrow than his former vices. For pride is as apt to grow upon our virtues as upon our vices, and pride goes before a fall <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 16:18</note>  , but humility before honor. We plainly see these sayings verified in very many instances. [End out of order]
10 of the Sixth Month, 1821. At our meeting, First Day. Came off pretty well without condemnation, but great room and great need of improvement. Blots, spots, and stains with the pollutions of the world – like poor David the prophet, and much worse perhaps than he or Solomon ever was.
12 of the Sixth Month. My dear old friend William Jackson of London Grove, Pennsylvania, and his companion John Phillips, came to see me. W. J. has always seemed to shew me respect and give me the right hand of fellowship, and I think he is one of the clearest, most unblemished character that I know of anywhere, and an able minister
<pb id="A0011237_27"/>
minister. [He] has visited England.
13 of the 6[th month], 1821. At our select quarterly meeting at Evesham the Yearly Meeting’s Committee divers of them there: Jesse Kersey, Samuel Beddle, William Jackson, Jonathan Evans, and John Comly. I thought forepart was a very dull time, but divers had lively, extensive service at last.
14 was quarterly meeting. A very full, crowded meeting. Jesse Kersey was large, lively, powerful and pertinent, and Richard Jordan and others at last favored once more to come off with satisfaction, although had met with some wounding cross occurrences. Poor creatures, we are, as William Penn says, always in danger of shot, like soldiers in battle. I daily see the need there is of watchfulness and prayer for preservation, and that continually. See the left hand, the words of David: he says the spirit of the Lord speaks by me, and his word was in my tongue <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 23:2</note>  . Yet see the very next chapter, what grievous affliction he brought on himself and upon his people. No wonder he cries out: Restore me to the joy of thy salvation and uphold me by thy free spirit <note resp="transcr">Psalm 51:12</note>  .
17. First Day. At our meeting to good satisfaction. There was sweetness and feeling nearness at parting, although pretty clost plain dealing.
24 of the Sixth Month. First Day. At our [indecipherable] meeting. Sarah Pope of Springfield was there, and had acceptable service. And Joshua Thompson, a young man – a schoolmaster from New York, has just now requested a right amongst us who appeared hopeful Fifth Day last. All as well as is common with us, but much dullness and drowsiness prevails, very much [in] this hot weather especially.
{1821-07}
1st of the Seventh Month. First Day. At our meeting. Very low and poor forepart, but grows better and ended savory at last. Sarah Smith of Philadelphia had acceptable service.

See William Law’s <italic>Address to the Clergy</italic>, page 31: Time and the things of time will soon have an end and the thought in time trusts to anything but the spirit and power of God working in his heart will be ill fit to enter into eternity. God must be all, in all, in us here or we cannot be his hereafter. Time works only for eternity, and poverty eternal must as certainly follow him who dies only fully stuffed with human learning as he who dies only full of worldly riches. The folly of thinking to have any divine learning but that which the Holy Ghost teaches, or to make ourselves rich towards God by heaps of commonplace learning crowded into our minds, will leave us as dreadfully cheated as that rich builder of barns in the gospel, to whom it was said: thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall all these things be which thou hast provided <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:19-21</note>  . So is every man that treasures up religious learning that comes not wholly from the spirit of God.
6 of the Seventh Month, 1821. Was our Monthly Meeting, and a lively, good meeting it was or else most of us were much mistaken. As James Simpson once said, here is a lively zeal amongst you, the mount of a king, the sword of the Lord and of Gideon <note resp="transcr">Judges 7:18</note>  . Yet great room and need of improvement in depth of wisdom, solidity, and weightiness.
8. First Day. At our meeting. Joseph Eastburn of Philadelphia, it is said he is not a member of any society, preached half an hour and some think he spoke very well. However, I thought the meeting ended pretty well.
<pb id="A0011237_29"/>
10 of the Seventh Month. A fine shower. Height of harvest here-a-way. The winter was very hard, the spring very cold and backward. Many was very late sowing in the fall, and the winter grain looked very poor in the spring. But there came a showery wet time, and it got up beyond all expectation and there appeared a fine prospect of a good harvest, but they say it is very light grained. There has been a kind of rust blast or mildew in some places, so that some fields where there was plenty of straw they say it is so blasted that it will hardly pay for reaping. And in some places, they say a kind of a little insect eats of the roots of young Indian corn, and has quite spoiled it in some places. How many ways there are for the fruits of the field and the labors of the husband man to be laid waste! As we read, it is said in Scripture: ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and the seed of an omer shall yield but an ephah <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 5:10</note>  . Or, he can open the windows and heaven and pour down blessings until there is hardly room to contain them <note resp="transcr">Malachi 3:10</note>  .
See <italic>Christian Magazine</italic>, page 454: surely if there be any thing that dignifies the man, it is the homage he pays to God. And if there be anything that debases us, it is the total want of a taste for spiritual and holy things. This is evidently demonstrated in the example of many being raised from a very low estate to sit among the heads of the tribes and princes of the people. And, on the other hand, how many have fallen into a poor, low, degraded state who once lived in a very reputable way? So true it is, [that] righteousness exalts a nation or an individual but sin a shame to any people. Do page 462: Nothing sets a person so much out of the Devil’s reach as humility; and what does pride do?
<pb id="A0011237_30"/>
If nothing sets a person so much out of the Devil’s reach as humility, then is there any thing that sets a person in Devil’s reach and power as pride does? Humility goes before honor, but pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 16:18</note>  . This has been often verified – not only in many individuals, but whole nations. Again, page 470: shall the angels of God witness that we prefer the empty toys to the pearl of infinite, inestimable, unchangeable volume? Empty toys indeed to the riches and earthly treasure appear to be hardly a name little enough to call them by at last when they must be parted with. For one might as well try to comfort a dying person with mountains of sand as with houses full of gold, when all the things of this world must sink into an equal nothingness forever.
15 of the Seventh Month, First Day. Clear, dry weather. The very great scarcity of birds makes me think of Jeremiah’s words: the birds of the Heavens are fled <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 4:25</note>  . Some sorts used to din one’s ears with their noises; now scarcely one to be seen – and of some sorts, none now to be seen. I have seen upwards of eighty years, and never till this ever seen a summer but what the chimney swallows lived with us and built in our chimneys. I know not who can tell the cause why it is so. One of our largest fields, and in more early days, great flocks of turkeys, pheasants, and partridges – but no such things are to be seen in these days. William Penn tells of turkeys in his days weighing forty pounds and upwards, and mentions the vast quantity of ducks in the Delaware, and other fowls and the great variety and plenty of fish with which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would be well content, say W. Penn.
<pb id="A0011237_31"/>
15 of the Seventh Month, 1821. At our meeting, many very drowsy. Harvest time, people work hard and, as Thomas Ross says, when they come to sit down nature calls for rest, and are overcome with sleepiness. Although they can resist that sleep-spirit in going to market, as soon as seated in meeting, [they fall] asleep. Yet I hope there was at last some savor of life.
Heaven must be preferred before earth and all its enjoyments if we would be real Christians. 
If religion be worth anything, it is worth everything. Though it is certain that true repentance is never too late, it is as certain that late repentance is seldom true.
Men may command thee but God may condemn thee.
When God punishes another, he threatens thee; when he wounds another, he warns thee.
If you mind nothing but the body, you lose body and soul too; If you mind nothing but earth, you lose earth and Heaven too.
It signifies nothing to say we will not change our religion if our religion change not us.
If you forget God when you are young, God may forget you when you are old.
Two duties must run through a Christian’s life, like the warp through the woof – blessing and trusting.
<italic>Christian Magazine</italic>, page 16: Azariah said, the Lord is with you whilst you be with him. If ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you <note resp="transcr">2 Chronicles 15:2</note>  . And as David told his son Solomon, if thou forsaketh him he will cast thee off forever <note resp="transcr">1 Chronicles 28:9</note>   – a state not in the power of imagination to conceive the dreadfulness of it, says Addison. As one 
<pb id="A0011237_32"/>
As one says, I have now lost what words cannot compensate: My God has withdrawn from me. His presence, oh no more.
Let me review and examine the direful cause of this. Wither, O my beloved, art thou gone? It needs no diligent search to find out the cause of thine absence. Well do I remember – ah awful season, [I] grew lukewarm and careless! I slighted the mercies of God and trifled with my privileges. Well, he is gone. Unhappy soul, whither shall I fly? Shall I ascend up into Heaven? He is there in his glory. Shall descend in Hell? He is there in his terrors. Shall I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth? There also his hand would find me. Whither then shall I go? From his presence I cannot fly. Poor man has no hiding place but in the munition of rocks. Arise, o God, for my help, nor suffer me never to rest contented without thy presence, in which David says is fullness of joy and his kindness better than life [Psalm 63:3], the loss of which the whole world cannot compensate. As William Penn says, thy life is upon it, thy soul is at stake. If thou neglects or abuses thyself in it, the whole world will not be price enough to ransom thee or countervail the loss. It is but once to be done.
19 of the Seventh Month, 1821. Fifth Day. At our meeting small, and a precious, owning time to me it was. I both feel and see what an excellent thing it would be to live without a will of our own, but alas, how unable we are of ourselves when we are right to keep so. Although David could say the spirit of the Lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue [2 Samuel 23:2], yet the very next chapter he charges himself with great folly and wickedness, which brought great destruction on them – seventy thousand died in 3 days of the pestilence, upwards of 23 thousand died in a day with the pestilence <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 24:15</note>  .
[marginal note] II of Samuel 23 chapter.
<pb id="A0011237_33"/>
Would not true humility have prevented this destruction if, like Mordecai after he had be in clothed with the king’s apparel and sat upon the king’s horse, he returned humbly and sat at the king’s gate <note resp="transcr">Esther 6:11-12</note>  ? And do we not read so of Daniel, after he had been distinguished by favored of the Lord, [he] went and sat at the king’s gate <note resp="transcr">Daniel 2:49</note>  . What instructing lessons to keep humble after times of favor!
But my weakness has been such that I have been hard beset to keep from being proud after times of favor – elevated, tickled, pleased – which has brought sufferings on me many times, and made me visit to be trusted with much. For the times of favor have been the very cause of the fall of such weaklings as Isidore. Used to say he that grown better, let him beware lest he grow proud and vain glory give him a greater overthrow than his former vices. For pride is apt to grow up on our virtues as upon our vices.
See <italic>Christian Magazine</italic>, page 239: he loves Christ not at all that loves him not above all. If religion be worth anything, it is worth everything. How many thousand of the martyrs and primitive Christians and our first Friends have chosen rather to suffer, to die the most cruel deaths – burned at the stake, hanged on the gallows, starved in dungeons and prisons, and banishment – rather than part with their religion. Whilst unknown numbers in prosperity are preferring the transitory treasures of this world and, like Esau, selling their birthright for a mess of pottage <note resp="transcr">Genesis 25:30-33</note>   and then too late sought it with tears, but found it not.
<pb id="A0011237_34"/>
See <italic>Christian Magazine</italic>, page 325: Christ is not prized at all unless he is prized above all. If we wish to grow in grace, it must be by the sincere milk of the word. Those who bring nothing but expect all things are the most welcome to come to Christ. The greatest and hardest work of a Christian is least in sight, which is the well doing of his heart. I never knew an eminent saint but he had either singular afflictions or singular corruptions to wrestle with. If I win Christ, I am rich towards God; if I am found in Christ, I am safe; if I know him, I am wise to salvation. Let the bitterness of sin make grace sweet and the sweetness of grace make sin bitter.
Seven arguments for contentment: (1) we have more than we deserve (2) we have more that we ever well improved (3) we have more than many of God’s dear children (4) we have more of this world than the Lord Jesus Christ had (5) we have more than we brought into the world and more than we can carry out (6) we have as much as infinite wisdom thinks best for us (7) if we have Christ and grace, we have what is better than all the world.
It is better to beg one’s bread with Lazarus on earth than to beg one’s water with divers in hell. Paul counted all but dross and dung that he might win Christ [Philippians 3:8]. If we win Christ, we have all we need. If we loose Christ, we lose all. If the Lord gives himself, can they be poor – though stript of all, as Job was – who obtain his favor? But are they not poor creatures, although they may have goods laid up in store for many years? Without his favor, we are poor creatures; with it, we are rich. [He] takes what he will away.

22nd of the Seventh Month, 1821. First Day. I with my daughter Abigail went to Cropwell, in company with Joseph Cowperthwaite and Charles Stow, an elder of Philadelphia. Religion seems at a low ebb there. meeting small and but little life stirring, which makes hard work getting along. But through mercy, it seemed to end well. Few, if any, exceed them in temporal affairs, although so dull and poor in spiritual labor.
We went to John Haines’s to dine, who has a large family of children, sons and daughters grown up; and we had a sitting with them – I hope and believe for the better. But oh, the rawness of the young generation! Their [they’re] giving way to a conformity, to the fashion and conformity to the world, threatens us with desolation. Yea, and desolation has overtaken very many – not only individuals, but whole meetings. How destitute are many of the life and vital part of true religion. Let the harp hang on the willows <note resp="transcr">Psalm 137:2</note>  .
See William Law’s <italic>Address to the Clergy</italic>, page 121: that which cannot help us to all goodness, cannot help us to any goodness; nor can that take away any sin but that which can take away all sin. But many say there can be no such thing as living in this world without sin.
Fifth Day, 26 of the Seventh Month. At our preparative meeting. Through mercy there was something of a feeling uniting, nearness and savory sweetness at parting. It is not always so far from it, so naked and poor we can hardly speak to one another.
<pb id="A0011237_36"/>
29 of the Seventh Month, 1821. First Day. At our meeting very dull and drowsy. Weather very dry and very hot. I was afraid we should be completely overwhelmed with a drowsy spirit. People work hard and nature calls for rest when they sit down, as Thomas Ross used to say.
{1821-08}
2nd of the Eighth Month, Fifth Day. At our meeting very dull and heavy. Weather very dry and hot here. It seems like a threatening, awful time here, although there has been rain on each side and all around us. It is a pinching time of drought and threatens the cutting of the Indian corn and buckwheat in our parts. We read the Lord caused it to rain upon one city and not upon another city <note resp="transcr">Amos 4:7</note>  .
See <italic>Christian Magazine</italic>, page 239: He loves Christ not at all who loves him not above all. They are justly punished that abuse lawful things, but they are most justly punished that use unlawful things. Thus Lucifer fell from Heaven, thus Adam lost his paradise. The life of man is the middle between angels and beasts. If man takes pleasure in carnal things, he is compared to beasts; but if he delight in spiritual things, he is suited with angels. How are some ever brothers of one family raised up and some degraded and cast down below the beasts, wallowing in their pollutions and drunkenness. Many shorten their days. What was that which Moses told the Children of Israel was not a vain thing: it is your life and by it ye shall prolong your days. If religion is worth any thing, it is worth all things. If it can bring us any goodness, it can bring all goodness we stand in need of, so is the one thing needful. But see Romans 1st and 31: without understanding covenant breakers, without natural affections, implacable and unmerciful. See what a miserable degraded state it is possible for mankind to fall into.
As you love your souls, beware of the world – it hath slain its thousands and tens of thousands. What ruined Lot’s wife? The world. What ruined Judas? The world. What ruined Simon Magus? The world. What ruined Demas? The world. And what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul <note resp="transcr">Mark 8:36</note>  ? If nature is indulged, grace, as to sense of it, takes its flight. Is not nature greatly indulged in these days? How gloomy the prospects.

5th of the Eighth Month, 1821. First Day. A more lively, open, owning meeting than common, I believe – but I am very jealous and afraid of being deceived, as thousand and tens and hundreds of thousands and millions, I verily believe, are in their state as to religions. We have very deceitful hearts and a subtle, deceitful enemy to deal with, and of all deceivers self deception is the worst. How often is the caution repeated in Scripture: be ye not deceived, beware lest your hearts deceive you <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 11:16</note>  , etc., etc. 
It is a very pinching time of drought just here with us, although there has been rain almost all round us. The corn and buckwheat and potatoes seem to languish very much – some potato vines quite dead, and it looks as there would be no corn if rain does not come soon, even where it looked very promising but a few days ago.
6. I went to the blacksmith’s, my son John’s, to get my wagon mend[ed], and whilst I was waiting for that I went to see Benjamin Burroughs, a poor old man that has lost his reason and seems very likely to starve himself to death. [He] is now very poor and lean of flesh. [He] does not speak to any one; has never paid any attention to religion of any sort, but been industrious, and raised up a family of children. So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 6:11</note>  .
Then I went to see their school next the meeting house, and had no cause to repent it – for the better, I hope. Then I went to see John Evans, died Twelfth Month. An old acquaintance and companion. In folly, he had a large plantation [indecipherable] to him, but has never done any good, neither in church or state. He has of latter time been very much afflicted with the gravel, and is very feeble. He seemed disposed to read religious books, and told me if he had his time to live over again, it would not be as it had been. I once heard an old man say his future state must be as it is, I cannot alter it now. It is too late for me to alter it now. What need there is to work while it is called today.
Then I went to see the widow Dudley, a young widow with 4 children. And called to see a poor widow whose husband died very sudden and left 3 children lately. All in sight of the meeting house.
[marginal note] Benjamin Burrow died in the Ninth Month.

9th of the Eighth Month, 1821. John Evans died last of the Twelfth Month 1821. Was our Monthly Meeting, which was for the most part satisfactory to me, but not all together so – some matters did not go to my mind. What small matters disturbs our peace, small matters disturbs still waters.
It holds remarkably clear: still hot, dry weather. The pastures are in places turned brown. Although we hear of fine rains in divers places, round about us it looks as if our Indian corn and buckwheat would be much cut off.

What a mercy we are delivered from such a priest’s yoke! We read that men were first created pure, but they have sought out many inventions, many many indeed, to their own hurt – things which the Lord never commanded them.
11th: Seventh of the week. My daughter Abigail and I, with Mary Gibbs of Philadelphia, went to Upper Evesham Monthly Meeting, which, on retrospection, is not unpleasant to think of. A great favor to be so far preserved. Dined at John Stokes; had a little pause at parting – for the better, I hope, although the waters seemed low. Very dry weather.
<pb id="A0011533_003"/>
12 of the Eighth Month, 1821. First Day. At our meeting. Waters very low. A dry time, both outwardly and as to religion. Very destitute of life, yet there seemed some things of life at last. Rebecca Price of Philadelphia had acceptable service.
13. It is so dry; all our mills round about us cannot grind. This day I took a grist to Benjamin Tomlinson’s mill at Timber Creek, about eight miles south of us. There seemed something like scrambling work about getting grain ground, there being so very few mills that can grind any now. I was very kindly entertained, although amongst a people where no religion prevails. I found [that] they lived on the failings of religious professors and I thought of a short sermon of Robert Walkers, which was: starve the Devil. So I wish we might not feed those who live on the failing of others, for it is very poor diet. One said, many go constant to meeting and not for the better. This is the very place where old Ephraim lived, an extraordinary elder and an excellent, exemplary friend.
16. Fifth Day. At our meeting. I did think we should have a quite shut up, silent meeting (and it was so to me), but there was several little appearances just at last – savory and lively.
19. First Day. Josiah Roberts went with me to Rancocas meeting. The waters appeared to me to be very low, I could [not] see nor feel any signs of any growth in true religion but a match for anything in caring for the outward man, which made hard work getting along. Yet through mercy it was an open, owning time at last, and openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness at last to general satisfaction, I believe.
Seventh Day night. There was a fine soaking shower about Moorestown and further northward, but we had but very little here.
23. At our preparative meeting. Lively and open, if it was of the right sort. Holds most awfully dry weather. Pastures scorched up.
26. First Day Morning. Vice stings us even in our pleasures, but virtue consoles us even in our pains.
<pb id="A0011533_004"/>
26. First Day, Eighth Month, 1821. At our meeting. Hannah Smith of Burlington had savory, acceptable service. A satisfactory meeting to me at last. This afternoon, I went to see the First Day boys’ school close to the meeting house and also went to see their girls’ school. About fifty little girls, mostly about five, six or seven years old, and several Black children. And went to see Nathan Morgan, and it was not unpleasant to look over the day’s work at night.
A certain author on the education of children says: they should serve as to the Lord and not to men, and think not of their pensions or perspicuities, so much as that the most important, the most honorable, of all employments is committed to your care. Reflect how great will be your reward for the exact discharge of your duties as you educate these children; they will educate theirs, and so on, till time shall be no more. And if you thus turn many to righteousness, you will shine the stars for ever for so doing, and those under your care become blessings to the world in every station of life and bright angels to all eternity. 
It is said of John Pemberton, who was a wealthy man, that health, wealth, strength of body, and the comforts of this life were sacrificed to the service of his Divine Master. But as to our schools, I fear we have lost sight of what they should be or what the teachers of schools should be. Let them read the account of Waltham Abbey School taught by John Mattron, who was a worthy minister and deeply concerned for the children’s improvement in religion as well as school learning. And his earnest concern was wonderfully blessed, for the Lord did manifest himself amongst them in their meetings, in their school, in a distinguished, powerful manner to the tendering their hearts in a wonderful manner. And when their teacher died, many of the children gave testimonies concerning their teacher and spoke of the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven – more like men and women established in religion than like children in their minority! I wish we might not sit down contented until we attain to the same religious experience, which would be the greatest blessing to the succeeding generation and also to the whole nation.
It is education forms the tender mind, / Just as the twig is bent, to so it’s inclined. As one said, he supposed if he had been breed amongst the heathens, pagans, Turks, or Mehomits [Muslims] he should have been one of that sort.
<pb id="A0011533_005"/>
28th of Eighth Month, 1821. I went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting with my two daughters. Poor and empty, begging for preservation, and although the house was full, I thought poverty prevailed and Burlington seemed lowering instead of rising. There was no Richard Jordan there, nor George Dillwyn. Burlington is now much stripped of their old standard bearers, yet there were divers young ministers appeared: Edwin Atley of Philadelphia appeared in prayer, and John Coxe expressed that he thought there was something owning attended the meeting. I was so far preserved as not to do any thing that I wished undone when I came at midnight to look over the day, which I count a very great favor. Had some pretty close remarks on the state of society and also in the sitting for worship.
30. At our meeting. No satisfaction. Our standing is in slippery places.
31. Our select meeting [was] a mortifying time to me. Mortifying things from different quarters, what a world of troubles and dangers it is! I am told that the drought is very severe and divers distant places, especially in some of the West India islands and Cuba. That the Negroes cannot raise enough to keep themselves, and it is said many of them starve to death for want of sustenance. It is said these accounts are in the newspapers.
A few days ago Samuel Cooper, son of Benjamin, a young man just arrived to age, died. An orderly, steady, young man with a kind of a fever. And another by the name of Anderson about 17, they died near together on the river shore. And it is said that this fever (some different from what they called the typhus fever) prevails very much over a great part of Pennsylvania.
{1821-09}
2nd of the Ninth Month, First Day. At our meeting. Rebekah Burr of Evesham had a pretty deal to say, savory and acceptable, I believe. A young man of Byberry tells me some fields of corn is quite spoiled with the drought, so that they turned the cattle into the fields of corn. This day the rain seemed to come more freely than it has done since harvest. Looks like a change of weather from very dry to wet, though we hear of there being rain in places round about us. We hear of three drowned – a steamboat ran over them. A man and two sons; and left a widow and seven children. How many solemn calls and how soon forgotten!
<pb id="A0011533_006"/>
We hear of many being drowned in the storm in the late storm of wind I hear that Joseph Swett’s mill is swept all away with this last sudden great flood of rain: it is very likely there was a great deal of grain in it how many solemn calls to humility after divers ways and manners: and yet how much pride and ingratitude abounds may we not say with the Prophet pride hath budded <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 7:10</note>   iniquity hath blossomed and brought forth a plentiful crop: although some now say they think there will not be more than half a crop of Indian corn and potatoes and buckwheat less.
6 of the Ninth Month, 1821, Fifth Day. At our monthly meeting most of which was satisfactory but one matter before our monthly made very difficult troublesome work; many troubles might be easily avoided if we would take the right way for it.
9. First Day. Mariah Embree of Trenton had considerable to say and some thought it a good satisfactory time but to me it was but a low time I want to feel our meetings crowned with life and with we might not sit down contented without it. Here is a remark I just now met with in a letter from a friend, piety and pride can no more thrive together than health and sickness: if so what will become of our religion in our days wherein there is such a rapid growth in pride. Nothing pleases a man more than to think he has avoided a foolish action it is a great mercy and favor to be so far preserved as to do nothing we shall have cause to wish undone and not be crying out (as some do all their life) we have done that which we ought not to have done and left undone that which we ought to have done. Our select meeting middling some satisfaction.
12 of the Ninth Month. At our quarterly meeting. The house pretty full and our galleries pretty well filled with able, amicable ministers, and we had a great deal of preaching. Several from Philadelphia and several from Nine Partners, Isaac Thorn and his wife. But preaching seems to do but little where people are set down and conclude [to] go no further, which seems to be the case with the professors of religion in the present day. If there was a desire to enquire of the Lord a right way for them and their little one to walk in, their state would be different. Some satisfaction, although not that life as at some times.
<pb id="A0011533_007"/>
14. Ninth Month, 1821. A young man returned just now from Salem tells me it is a very sickly time there-a-way, and he says many wealthy families cannot get nurses to take care of them. William Rogers’s son of Evesham brought up a corpse from there yesterday, a young man. How often humbling things overtake poor mortals, and how does pride and luxury look and an afflicting, humbling, circumstances. See <italic>Select Lives</italic>, page 95, Fenelon: The true riches and prosperity of a state consists in pruning the luxuries of living, and being content with simple and innocent things or pleasures. By this the demonstrates that true virtue does not only fit men for a state of happiness hereafter, but that it actually makes societies of people happy even in this life, as far as it is capable of being so. No doubt it is the will of our great Creator that his people should be happy, and is there not a way cast up whereby they may attaint to present and future happiness? But it is not to be attained in pride and luxury, but in resignation and humility. 
What cannot resignation do?
It wonders can perform
That powerful charm thy will be done
Can lay the lowest storm.  <note resp="transcr">Edward Young</note> 

I am grown old and not able to carry on business. Crops fail and my wife very poorly. All prospects as to the outward looks gloomy; whilst my neighbors all round are carrying on business all around me, I feel like one of the hindmost amongst human beings. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners <note resp="transcr">Psalm 1:1</note>  . Blessed, blessed, blessed indeed are they who walk in the way that leads to the abodes of the blessed. But for want of this, oh, to see and feel the unhappiness, disorder, misery, and confusion that abounds amongst us poor mortals, which might be easily avoided by taking heed to the reproofs of instruction, the way of life. But for want of this may we not say, the quadruped, the insect, and the fly fill up their station better far than I.
15. First Day. At our meeting quite silent, which is rare with us. This afternoon at 4th hour Isaac Thorn and his wife, from Nine Partners, had a meeting here at Moorestown house. Full crowded. They both had a great deal to say, she especially. Much pertinent council they preached till sundown, but alas, how little good it seems to do, how soon all forgotten! Yet we don’t know it may be as bread cast upon the waters and found after many days with some.
<pb id="A0011533_008"/>
16th of the Ninth Month, 1821. Second Day. I went to Micajah Will’s to get some shingles for our kitchen. Whilst I was there waiting for him to come home, I picked up some newspapers (which the children were throwing about the floor) wherein I found accounts of the late great sudden fall of rain and hard wind. It appears it was a very great deal harder eastward than it was here. At New York and Long Island and in New England it is said the roofs were blown off many houses. Some houses blown down, and people killed, and divers barns blew down, and many cattle killed, and their cellars and stores filled and spoiled with the sudden inundation of water, ruined their wharves and stores. Thus they were visited with a violent storm, and it is said forty vessels or more were shipwrecked on their coasts and many lives lost. Many dead bodies were found on their shores – 30 or 45, it is said, found on Long Island. Ships were wrecked and torn to pieces in many places and ports.
See Psalms 50 chapter 22 verse: Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver. If we did but consider how many ways for humbling things to overtake, and how often they do overtake people, it would seem a wonder that pride, ingratitude, and forgetfulness should ever prevail amongst human beings, which brings such destruction often and misery upon many in these days as we read in Scripture it did on the people in days of old. And yet I read in the same papers an account of most grievous sorrowful work in the southern states, of their kidnapping and grievously oppressing the poor Negroes – although call after call has been given, warning after warning has been sent from heaven.
See Deuteronomy 7 and 21: the Lord thy God is a mighty God and terrible; 10 and 21: hath done for the terrible things. Job says 37 and 22: with God is terrible majesty. And see Psalms 65 and 5: by terrible things in righteousness will he answer us; [66 and] 5: terrible in his doings towards the children of men; 146 and 6: men shall speak of thy terrible ones is as a storm; the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 25:4-5</note>  . No doubt many have been brought very low and much reduced by the late terrible storm in a few minutes, and many drowned and very suddenly taken away, and many left in sorrow and mourning and very bitter, humbling circumstances.
[marginal note] This storm was after many weeks very severe drought.
<pb id="A0011533_009"/>
20th of the Ninth Month, 1821. We went to Evesham meeting, which was very large. Isaac Thorn and his wife were there and had abundance to say – both of them, but she especially. And the people were very attentive and still. But although we could say their conduct was most decorous, how much better it would be if it could be said they were evidently making the best use of their time to make their peace with God, as was said of one very near his end? And of another, who was so devoted to do all the good he could that they said of him they did not believe he lost one minute? And of another, devoted, dedicated servant of the Lord that he said he did not desire to spend one minute to please himself? If the people were like-minded with the people in the days of Ezra, when they sat down by the river Ahava to enquire of the Lord a right way for them and their little ones to walk in <note resp="transcr">Ezra 8:21</note>  , they would be in a much more fit and more favorable state to hear the tidings of the Gospel preached than they now are, set down at ease where they now are, seemingly not desirous to go any further. But if we were all so much in earnest to make our calling and election sure as not to be desirous to spend one minute to please ourselves – as William Hunt said he was, or as they said of Fenelon or Du Renti [?] so intent upon doing all the good he could as not to lose one minute – would it be too much to obtain the answer of will done at last or should we ever have cause to repent it? No, no, is it not the way everlasting which David prayed to be led into <note resp="transcr">Psalm 139:24</note>  , never to be repented of?
24. First Day. At our meeting. I thought it was the most evidently owning that I have seen latterly. But alas, to think that Noah was a preacher of righteousness, we are told, an hundred years before the flood – yet wickedness prevailed until it was said all flesh had corrupted their ways and the flood was sent that swept them all away except Noah and his family. And Moses was called a prophet, and his people were a gainsaying, backsliding people, and all fell in the wilderness and were not suffered to enter the promised land except Caleb and Joshua. And were the people Christ had to preach to any better? Very many of them [were not], for see how they crucified him at last. We now in our days have abundance of preaching, line upon line and precept upon precept, but are we coming up out of the wilderness or are we going back into it, conforming to the spirit of the world, which is enmity with God?
<pb id="A0011533_010"/>
28 of the Ninth Month. Sixth of the week. Wallace Lippincott, who has been several weeks in an afflicted state, mostly confined to his room and bed, sent word that he desired I would come and see him this day. Joseph Cowperthwaite went with me to see him, and he seemed pleased with our visit and I believe we had no cause to repent it.
30. Was First Day. I went to Vincintown with Josiah Roberts, which they say was smaller than common. Religion is at a low ebb at that place and has been so many years, although they have lately built a new meeting house and I hope are in some little way of improving, but great room for more. Yet however it was an open satisfactory time in general, I believe. They showed loving, kind, and inviting at parting. We dined at George Chandler’s, whose wife had sent word to me wishing I would come and see her. Has been many weeks very poorly and very much afflicted and confined with the rheumatism. Better, but cannot walk yet. She expressed satisfaction with the visit.
On our way home, we called to see Jemime Hurley, my sister’s daughter, who stays at her brother-in-law’s, James Hileis; very ill with the dropsy, and appears near her end. We got well home just at dark, and had no cause to repent the way in which we spent the day. George Chandler’s wife is George Churchman’s daughter, granddaughter to the worthy John Churchman, and is lately recommended a minister. This night and Second Day morning a soaking, heavy rain.
See the words of James Meikle, page 35: I found that to live near God was the sweetest life in the world, and sweetens every condition; but I find that although the world could say but little against me, conscience could say a great deal. But oh, what a black life was mine when narrowly surveyed, when by meditation it was, as it were, taken to pieces. And see, page 32nd, were men as stupid about the things of this life as they are about the world to come, they would be a burden to society and useless in their generation. How deplorable is it then that they should be prudent in matters not of the last but of the least importance, and that even those who otherwise are indolent should perpetrate sin with the greatest activity when neither judgment nor mercies, promises or threatenings, patience nor examples of vengeance can prevail. Nothing can let them see their folly till awakened by the flames of Hell, when it is too late. Vanity of vanities, emptiness, and vapor are all the enchanting, delusive joys and pleasures, riches and treasures of this delusive world. 
[marginal note] Fever and chill much prevalent.
<pb id="A0011533_011"/>
See [Henry] Scougal <italic>Life of God in the Soul of Man</italic>, page 86: oh! what a poor thing would the life of man be if it were capable of no higher enjoyments than the things of this world can afford. Some call it a mere animal life, which is not influenced with the inspiration of the Almighty. Be ye not as the horse or as the mule, who have no understanding, says David the prophet [Psalm 32:9]. And how many there are who spend their days like the mole graveling in the earth, partaking daily of the bountiful gifts of Heaven; who like the swine eat the fruit under the tree, but never look up from whence it comes. But how will this do in the end?
I have heard of one of this sort who at last cropped out: of darkness, darkness, darkness and so died away. The language of another earthly world being was: at last now I must go and oh, that I might go in peace! Ten thousands of worlds, one upon the back of another, would not tempt me to live in this world as I have done! Although this was one who supported a good name amongst men and filled conspicuous stations in civil society, yet this was his language when he came to be awakened, to see the necessity of a truly religious life, the inward life, the life of God in the soul of man that is hid with Christ in God. As I once heard a poor, benighted, belated creature say, ten thousands of worlds would I now give if I had it in my power, if my peace was but made with the Lord. One says the life of those wholly devoted to earthly concerns may well be compared Nebuchadnezzar ate grass <note resp="transcr">Daniel 4:33</note>  ; earthly things feed, fill, and satisfy both of them.
{1821-10}
4 of the Tenth Month, 1821. Was our Monthly Meeting, and I believed was not alone in thinking it was a right good meeting – sweetness, solidity, weight, and savor. Who can set forth the excellency of a peaceful, tranquil mind? We read of the dew of Hermon that descended upon the mountains of Zion where the Lord commanded the blessing ever life forever more <note resp="transcr">Psalm 133:3</note>  . I thought I should not dare say we were not favored with something like it.
7th was First Day. At our meeting. Very poor and low forepart, but ended better.
Second Day morning. See <italic>The Traveler</italic>, by James Meikle, page 128: the man whose conscience is awakened shall find a constant companion and unwearied reprover, who will either reprove to purpose or reproach forever. Again, nothing in the world can preserve from or enable to support a wounded spirit; if the stroke comes from above, so must the relief. How poor are all possessions to a person who has no peace!
[marginal note] Direful are the consequence of desires misplaced; set your affections on things above.
<pb id="A0011533_012"/>
Paul and Silas could sing praises in a prison [Acts 16:25] because when God giveth quietness none can cause trouble. Oh, how poor a thing would the life of man be if it were capable of no higher enjoyments than the joys and pleasures, riches and treasures this word can afford, says [Henry] Scougal (as remarked on the other side of this leaf). And the words of Meikle also: Oh, how poor are all earthly possessions to a person who has no peace within! See the Traveler, page 130: there is as great difference between a man in a renewed and unrenewed state as between a man fast asleep and broad awake. Think of the man we read of, who concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years, that would say: lo, his soul, eat drink and be merry or take his rest. So lo in the lap of pleasure, but the language was: thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall these things be which thou hast provided? And so shall it be with all those who lay up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:19-21</note>  . And again, see page 136: They are to beware that they do not stick on the sands of carnal security, or run into the shallow waters of lukewarm indifferency, or be blown on the rocks of bold confidence by the high winds of spiritual delusion. See what the Scriptures say concerning rejoicing in the Lord, and consider how such talk sounds in the ears of the earthly worldly minded.
11 of the 10th month, 1821. Fifth Day. At our meeting smaller than common. Much sickness in the neighborhood – chill and fever. Several of my son Benjamin’s family sick with it, but now some better. It was very low and poor forepart, but a woman from Plainfield rose up and did speak excellently well, and it ended savory and satisfactory.
12. Rainy stormy day. [Henry] Scougal <italic>Life of God in the Soul of Man</italic>, page eighty: it is an advice worthy of a Christian though it did first drop from a heathen. Penn thought before we betake ourselves to rest we [should] renew and examine all the passages of the day, that we may have the comfort of what we have done aright and may redress what we find to have been amiss, and make the shipwrecks of one day be as marks to direct our course in another. This may be called the very part of victorious living, and would contribute wonderfully to advance our reformation and preserve our innocency. But with all we must not forget to implore the divine assistance, especially against those sins that most easily beset us.
<pb id="A0011533_013"/>
Again see [Henry] Scougal, page 74. No wonder then if souls overpowered with Divine love despise inferior pleasures and be almost ready to grudge the body it's necessary attention for the common accommodations of life, judging all these imperatives to their main happiness. I have read of divers of our first friends who were so enamored with the Divine life that were very desirous to make as little do for the body as would suffice nature (bread to eat and raiment to put on, etc.) that they might be the better enabled to do good and communicate to the poor and needy and be at liberty to serve the Lord. But alas, how few of that sort to what there have been of those whose language is what shall we eat what shall we drink, etc. And oh, how precious the effects and fruits of the one, and how direful the consequence of desires misplaced.
14 was First Day. 9th hour we went to the burial of Samuel Roberts, a stout, healthy, corpulent man – he has been all his lifetime. Aged about seventy, an orderly, quiet, peaceable man, and a constant attender of meetings and had great store of earthly treasures. There was a great concourse of people. I had satisfaction in undone [undoing] nothing, nor leaving undone what I thought I ought to do. At the meeting, Hinchman Haines had considerable to say and I thought it ended reputably. He died with this fall fever, which we hear is very prevalent. 
I hear of the death of Joshua Bourton, who a very few weeks ago went with Josiah Roberts and me in a boat from his house up to Samuel Wells’ to Ancocas meeting. A constant attender of meeting, a very innocent man, 75. See Meikle, page 215: a grey head and a carnal, worldly heart is a wounding sight, but a young man and an agued loved one in his prime and all his graces flourishing is comely to behold. Henceforth begone the bewitching vanities and all the enchantments of the world; the evening of my life is not to be trifled away by you. Death attends me, the grave awaits me, and eternity is at hand. Therefore may my purified affections river-like enlarge as they approach the ocean. Page 237: Why did I prostitute the temple of my soul to the idols of time? Why permit the world and self a place in that temple which the godhead is to inhabit forever? Page 239: Ah, was I ever so stupid, so brutish as to make any comparison between riches and righteousness, gold and glory, earth and heaven the creature and the creator or God!

It is dangerous to swim in hot seas where sharks along shores, where alligators devour – and doubly so to wallow in wealth and ease, where lusts and Satan destroy. 139: Jeshurun, who when he waxed fat, kicked, and in his greatness forgot him that make him great <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 32:15</note>  .

So, generally speaking, more corruption (pride, lust, carnal security, wrath etc.) abound among such as are finally clothed and fare sumptuously every day than among those that sit down to one meal and know but little how to provide the next.
Seneca says prosperity, like a strong gale, soon carries a man out of sight of peace. Let us compare our lives with the faithful truly in earnest to give all diligence to make their calling and election sure so as not to lose one minute nor desire to expend one minute to please ourselves and keep our selves continually upon the stretch in doing all the good we could, both to the bodies and souls of men according to our ability of bodily strength and worldly wealth and estate. As it has been said of some, should we ever have cause to repent it or would it be too much to obtain the answer of well done, at last enter thou into the joys of thy Lord? But instead of a life so spent, [we] have to say: alas, what precious time and sweet meditation have I wasted on toys and trifles, and despised the joy of angels and the work of Heaven. When time is at an end here, may we not say: where are all the things of time now, which once made such great demands upon us? How they then sink into an insignificant nothingness, hardly a name little enough to call them by! And [we] have to say with Grotius: Alas, I have consumed much of my time in laborious doing of nothing; no treasure laid up in Heaven, nothing done to purpose, all vanity and vexation of spirit, bound on a voyage of awful length and dangers little known, a stranger to superior strength. Can man vainly trust his own? But oars alone can ne’er prevail to reach the distant cast; the breath of Heaven must swell the sail or all the toil is lost.

17th of the Tenth Month, 1821. Went to the burial of Thomas Lippincott of Westfield, an elder in good esteem. Has traveled a pretty deal with ministering Friends, and has been a very kind friend to me, in going with me visiting families at East Branch above Crosswicks, and at Springfield and Ancocas meeting, and about to meetings in divers places. Hichman Haines had a good deal to say both at the house and at the meeting, and Thomas Kite of Philadelphia and Elizabeth Coleman of Burl[ington] and myself had a share in the labor to good satisfaction. A solemn time it seemed to be.
18 was Fifth Day. At our meeting. Small but for me not the worst. An invitation was given to the burial of David Walton’s wife, a daughter of Granvil Woolman’s. [She] has been married but a few months.
21. First Day. At our meeting. I should not dare say there was no savor of life attended, but oh, how little of that we experience in our meetings and when our hands are upon our labor and on our pillows to what we might do if we were not wanting our part! Remember Marmaduke Stevenson when he was following the plows, and Elijah also. And the prophet says when he was by the river Chebar the Heavens were opened and he saw visions of God <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 1:1</note>  . I now hear of the death of several young men, two buried in one day in one graveyard at Woolwich or Mullica Hill, and two ancient women upwards of 90 years, Katharine Slimn and A. Ivins, near Westfield.
25. At our preparative meeting. Very small, but I hope some little life. gathering corn, which [is] the poorest crop I ever had. Some have none, we hear. In places, many say they have not half a crop. Buckwheat very small, and some [have] none at all. Potatoes some better.
28. The scale turned for me and my daughters to go to Evesham meeting, which was pretty full, and through mercy it was a favored, open, owning time. I do not remember ever having a meeting there so savory and lively. Oh, how sweet and pleasant, kind and exciting, they were when meeting broke up. I had cause to think it was to general satisfaction.
<pb id="A0011533_016"/>
Several meeting days past I have [had] nothing material to remark, except it was poverty, leanness, and lowness – so that I thought of David’s words, make haste to help me, restore me to the joy of thy salvation and uphold me by the free spirit <note resp="transcr">Psalm 51:12</note>  . For indeed we are poor, helpless creatures without it. Some are like what Stephen Crisp says, up and down, full and empty, joyful and sorrowful, just as things go well or ill in the world. And some are like Armelia Nicolas, who said: When I found the Lord was pleased with me I was happy, but without that nothing in this world could content me. Oh, what poor creatures! See the last words of David, he says: the spirit of the Lord spake by me; his word was in my tongue <note resp="transcr">2 Samuel 23:2</note>  . And then in the very next chapter, complaining of his sins and iniquities, which brought such grievous trouble and destruction on him and his people. In thy presence is fullness of joy, said David; thy kindness is better than life <note resp="transcr">Psalm 63:3</note>  . Is there anything in this world worth living for without it?
{1821-11}
8 of the Eleventh Month, 1821. Was our Monthly Meeting. Hannah Smith, wife of Daniel, and Hannah Smith, wife of James, and Elizabeth Coleman of Burlington, and William Ridgway. The women all had short, sweet testimonies, and I do believe there was something of the ownings of truth and savor of life attended the meeting throughout, to right good satisfaction. A healing, strengthening since it seemed to be to me.
11. First Day. We went to Evesham meeting; an open owning time to general satisfaction it appeared to be. This afternoon, went to the burial of Jemime Hurly, my sister’s daughter. She married a man with a plantation and settled with a hopeful prospect, but he proved to be a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow; left her to bring up her children herself. She wearied trough the world somehow and brought up her family of children, six or seven of them. Lived mostly in Philadelphia, joined the Baptists, and her sister A. Stiles, the Methodists. So there was at the burial, mixed company of Baptists, Methodists, and Quakers. They were very orderly, but very destitute of life or the ownings of truth, so not much satisfaction.
Second Day. Joseph Foulk of Gwynedd or North Wales and his companion came to see me. He is visiting the meetings here in Jersey. I went with them to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. Richard Jordan and Joseph had very acceptable service, and some savor of life attended. But their meeting for discipline was very lean, poor, and low. About 15 years ago I had a meeting where J.F. lives, which he spoke much of. The most favored time [I have] ever seen.
<pb id="A0011533_017"/>
13. The Eleventh Month. I took a log to the saw mill for lash to shingle our kitchen.
14. We went to Westfield meeting appointed for Joseph Foulke, who had good service – but the waters are low. There we spent the afternoon together at widow Lippincott’s, had a little sitting at parting – for the better, I hope – at Lidia Lippincott’s.
16. Fifth Day have been at several meetings; we were ready to conclude to omit attending our own meeting, but yet did get there and had no cause to repent it. Though the meeting was small, some thought it was a lively good meeting; something of the ancient dew of Hermon that descended on the mountains of Zion <note resp="transcr">Psalm 133:3</note>  .
17. Soled Mary’s shoes, although a good deal unwell with the colic, vomiting, and sick stomach. Joseph Foulke mentioned a meeting I was at about 15 years ago where he lives; I suppose it was one of the most owning, favored meetings I ever had. William Blake said it was the best meeting he ever seen at that place: this is the cap sheaf, this crowns all. It was the concluding or last I had in that visit to them parts. Jacob Paxton said he wished he had got more of this family along to that meeting. Returned home with sweet peace.
19. First Day. At our meeting. Ebenezer Roberts and our daughter and myself at last had something to say, and I believe it ended well. But I am afraid of being deceived with a counterfeit peace, as it is to be feared thousands and tens and hundreds of thousands are, for we have very treacherous, deceitful hearts and a deceitful, unwearied enemy to war with, and of all deceivers self-deception is the worst. Is it not said that if it were possible Satan would.
[21.] Third Day I went to mill. The weather dry and cold.
[22.] Fourth Day I have had but little time of late to read or write. But see the words of Armella Nicholas – when the soul is blest with the approbation of God and experiences the effects of his grace, everything which can befall it is easily supportable. But without his favor, without support or hope, how pitiable! In thy presence, said David, is fullness of joy; his loving kindness is better than life <note resp="transcr">Psalm 63:3</note>  . One thing have I desired and that will I seek, after I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food <note resp="transcr">Job 23:12</note>  . Said another: man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God <note resp="transcr">Luke 4:4</note>  . Martha, Martha, thou art careful about many things; one thing is needful <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:41-42</note>  . Let me feel thy presence or else my time is lost and my life a snare to my soul. 
<pb id="A0011533_018"/>
Her body being reduced to a weak state from the great concerns of her soul.
And further, says A. Nicolas, wherever anything of the creature is found, so much there is of defect and human weakness and imperfection! Remember well meaning Uzza, who was struck dead for attempting to put his hand to steady the ark <note resp="transcr">1 Chronicles 13:10</note>   and again if though lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted <note resp="transcr">Exodus 20:25</note> <italic> </italic> it. What is it we wait for in silence at our Monthly Meeting before we enter on the business of the discipline, and how is it and what is the consequences, fruits, and effects? Where, as Robert Walker says, the discipline is carried on in the strength and will of the man’s part certainly it must be very poor doings, and he said it was too generally the case. And I thought Robert Walker was one of the greatest seers or prophets that ever visited America in my time. 
I might add James Nayler’s words to these exercised deep travelers: days of mourning and nights of watching. And Dorothy Owin who, it is said, kept herself up on the stretch to the utmost of her ability as to her natural strength and personal estate. To do good and communicate forget not, said the apostle <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 13:16</note>  . And how many might I mention of these devoted, deeply exercised servants of the Lord? How different is their state from those that are lolling in the lap of ease and slumbering in the bosom of carnal security! A great difference between thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee and then it be with all who lay up treasure for themselves and are not rich towards God <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:19-21</note>  : and to [indecipherable] done thou good and faith servant enter thou into the joy of thy Lord and into thy masters everlasting rest <note resp="transcr">Matthew 25:21</note>  . I think Thomas à Kempis says while Jesus is present, all things are pleasant. As I just now noted, Armella Nicolas words: when the soul is blessed with the approbation of God whatever may befall it is easily supportable. But what would it profit a man if he gain the whole world and loose the favor of this almighty supporting power last? And what would a man give in exchange for his soul? Why this I have heard from one on a dying bed: then thousand of worlds would I give if it was in my power for peace with the Lord. And it has been the case with very many; likely it will be with many more.
[Addition] Thomas Ross says if friends think to do the Lord’s work as they do their own, they will greatly fail.
<pb id="A0011533_019"/>
22 of the Eleventh Month. At our preparative meeting which I believe would have been better if less had been said although I came off without much condemnation.
23 and 24. Shingling our kitchen rain and snow at night.
25. First Day. At our meeting almost silent not the poorest to me.
2 and Third Day. And a little before I have been reading some precious accounts lately printed at New York concerning public Friends and others deceased divers, of them I was intimately acquainted with very precious, animating accounts; they are manifesting these sayings great peace have they that love thy law etc. <note resp="transcr">Psalm 119:165</note>  . The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous <note resp="transcr">Psalm 118:15</note>  .
29. Fifth Day. At our meeting somewhat satisfactory to me although almost silent. Next day at our select meeting. Waters very low and I rubbed harder an account of its being so than they could well bear: is it etc. a few days ago I had an instructing lesson in a silent meeting; oh how poor a thing is the life of man if he were capable of no higher enjoyments than this world can afford it illustrated on my mind in an instructing manner: the enjoyment of the mere sensualist is no higher than that of the pampered horse in the stable or the fattened pig in the sty. Indeed the brute has much the advantage as it lives according to its nature and destination while the man is haunted with a perpetual consciousness of the shameful degradation of his moral and intellectual faculties: be ye not like the horse or the mule that hath no understanding says David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 32:9</note>  . The sensualist wholly given up to the things below is compared to Nebuchadnezzar at grass when a bests [beast’s?] heart was given him <note resp="transcr">Daniel 4:33</note>  ; the people nowadays can hardly bear to hear such talk although real happiness consists in placing our affection on things above is there not abundant evidence of the truth of this and of the direful effects of desires misplaced yet how many are bemired and entangled with their accommodations and conveniences making temporary heavens here and as William Penn say they like them so well they would never leave them if they could help it: and some have said they did wish a better Heaven than they enjoyed in the midst of their prosperity but who does Solomon say vanity of vanities all is vanity <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 1:2</note>  .
<pb id="A0011533_020"/>
{1821-12}
2 of the 12th month, 1821. First Day. At our meeting. I find I fare best when I am most clear of a will of my own a favored, satisfactory, strengthening meeting I felt as if I was not afraid to be had up a little like Robert Nesbit after he had been delivering some pretty close doctrine said now I feel as if you could not hurt me: 3rd killing hogs weather moderate.
3. Oh how poor a thing is the life of man if he were capable of no higher enjoyments than this world can afford; although all are gifted with a capacity for higher enjoyments than this world can afford, yet how many thousands deprive themselves of that greatest of blessings by placing their love on strong drink, how do they degrade themselves below the brutal part of the creation, and how much better are those who bury their talents in the earth who mind earthly things only: who as William Edmondson says who might otherwise if they improved their talents be of great service in the church. Oh earth, earth hear oh earth the word of the Lord can <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>   words describe their folly who part with heaven to please their taste or for any sublunary enjoyment.
John Pemberton was a wealthy man and they say health, wealth, strength of body and the comforts of this life were sacrificed to the service of his Divine Master a disposition very different from those who bury their talents in the earth but I could mention thousands more who were like minded who have been the salt of the earth and as lights in the world <note resp="transcr">Matthew 5:13-14</note>  .
6. Was Monthly Meeting. We had a shower of strangers from Pennsylvania: Amos Hillburn, Samuel Comfort and John Justice and although thing seemed low forepart it growed better at last and ended savory and well, many very pertinent remarks.
8. Seventh Day. I went to Woodbury with Amos Hilburn. Enoch Roberts took us in his wagon we went to see a black man in prison who is to be hanged next Sixth Day. We had, I believe, some very pertinent remarks to him but his heart did not seem soft. He is condemned for shooting a Negro man. He appears to me to be a smart, sensible fellow of a fierce spirit.
<pb id="A0011533_021"/>
9th of the Twelfth Month. First Day. We were at Woodbury meeting and an open, favored time it was I was afraid we should quarantine them for between us we kept them till near 2 o’ clock but they did sit very patient and attentive and it ended savory and well. I believe we had a little pause at Mary Allins where we dined on Seventh day and something savor and at parting at John Tatum’s sons [where] we lodged – Amos Hillburn called the children together and we left Woodbury with sweet peace and satisfaction although their meeting has lately been much stripped of their ministers John Tatum and John Reeve and religion is at a low ebb at that place although they improve and shine in worldly prosperity I have wanted to be at their meeting many months past I had many acquaintance down there and great was the love and respect, inviting kindness, openness, and feeling nearness when meeting broke up as if old acquaintance and near connections had meet after long absence.
10. We came up to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting where there were a number of strangers and forepart it seemed a very low, poor time and much shut up but one after another had something to say and it seemed to raise the life a little but to me it was a quite shut up, very poor time, yet I had a very pertinent pointed lesson but kept it.
11. About home.
12. At select meeting at Evesham. A number of ministers from Pennsylvania and divers had acceptable service. John Comly in particular did please me exceedingly well. I was much gratified and edified with his company. He is a great minister and had very acceptable lively service at our quarterly meeting next Day 13, but Sarah Cresson took up the greatest part of the time she has just got out of a very low, depressed, disconsolate state but appears to be now quite wholly restored and was and is now more large, lively, and powerful in her ministry than ever. There was a large number of ministers and I thought they were kept in beautiful order not disturbed with babblers. In the afternoon we had a right down, searching, scraping, lively time as with lighted candles on the state of society I had right good satisfaction at last a violent stormy day of rain and good snow.
<pb id="A0011533_022"/>
16 of the Twelfth Month, 1821. First Day we have had several days and nights of very severe, freezing weather I was doubtful it would be too cold for me to go out to meeting but did went and had no cause to repent. I thought it ended pretty well and reputably though not that animation, life, and evident ownings of truth as at some times.
20. Fifth Day. At our meeting Isaiah Darnel and Mary Haines were married. Elizabeth Balderston and Ann Qucksil were there and had acceptable service and several others; and I thought it ended pretty well or as well as is common nowadays, but alas where are we but in a dreaming state to what we might be if we were not wanting on our part. David says when the Lord restored again the captivity of Zion we were as them that dream <note resp="transcr">Psalm 126:1</note>  ; oh what a difference we should feel if we were favored with the company of him who turned their water into wine at the marriage of Cana of Galilee <note resp="transcr">John 2:1-11</note>  . I thought I had something pointed and pertinent but saw no room to open it.
23. First Day. At our meeting came off pretty well but think it would have been better if there had been rather less said. Let each day be a critic on the last, the way to improve.
13 of last month [i.e., November] they hanged the Negro I went to see and I hear there appeared some tokens of tenderness at last; the same evening a young woman was stabbed by a man at Philadelphia. She lived about eight days and died and was brought over the river to her father’s in Gloucester County. My son Benjamin seen the corpse at the ferry it is said that the man that murdered the woman had a wife and several children yet was suspected of being too familiar with the young woman and others, and another dreadful account at Mount Holly. Two white girls with two Negro men stole some money, 30 dollars, and a wagon and horses and went as far as Trenton; there, their horses tired and they left them, and went on a foot. They pursued them and took them and brought them back to Holly goal. Another account says Caleb Bourton a native of Moorestown or near there died with a wound in his arm occasioned only by being bled; the doctor cut off the vein. He was a very tall, lusty, young man had in former years gave way to drink to excess but refrained and obtained a good name and reputation at school keeping, broke out again and gave way too much to strong drink, upon which I wrote him a letter of which I am now glad.
27. 5th Day. At our meeting pretty lively, if it was of the right sort. Very cold, freezing weather.
<pb id="A0011533_023"/>
30. First Day. Our meeting was mortifying, humbling time to me for want of more evidence of the ownings of truth and savor of life, not for want of word. But it might be profitable my peace said the Divine Master I give unto you <note resp="transcr">John 14:27</note>  ; it is his right and he knows best when to give and when to withhold it but I conclude there is nothing in this world worth living for, without it. Weather moderate, dry and still and middling cold.
{1822-01}
4 of the First Month, 1822. Fifth Day. At our meeting Joseph Whiteall of Woodbury was there and a precious, sweet, cementing time it was: favored with that ancient dew of Hermon that descended upon the mountains of Zion <note resp="transcr">Psalm 133:3</note>   to my sweet satisfaction. Very cold freezing weather I cannot bear to be much out from the stove.
7th First Day. At our meeting very destitute of the stirrings of life I endeavored to stir up the people to a concern and care for the poor but there seemed to be a want of animation. It is very severe freezing, cold weather many poor people must suffer very much: I have read of accounts of other societies what having they called charity sermons for the relief of the poor.
Fifth Day it was so cold and several of us unwell, none of us got to meeting. Heard of the death of Joseph French of Moorestown, a stout, strong man shortened his days with drinking to excess, left a large family of children.
13. First Day. At our meeting and I thought there was something of the evident owning of truth which I count a great favor: but daily labor for daily bread is necessary.
14. I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. The yearly meetings [indecipherable] John Comly, Samuel Biddle, Jonathan Evans and Hinchman Haines were but were much shut up. Richard Jordan spoke and seemed to help or would have appeared a very poor, low time it appeared to be a very low time as to discipline; great weakness appeared.
15. Our meeting was adjourned to suit the committee. We had a much more open time and more satisfactory, but the testimony was not raised into dominion as I could wish. Although John Comly spoke very well, yet not that pointed, pressing work I thought necessary. I had good satisfaction though but a small share of the labor.
<pb id="A0011533_024"/>
1822. Heard of the death of John Mitchell an old man and hard drinker, yet from accounts there seemed room to hope for he seemed composed and said he was willing to die and requested a tin coffin. Anthony Benezet used to say never give any man out, remember the thief on the cross <note resp="transcr">Luke 23:39-43</note>  .
20 of the First Month, 1822. First Day. I went with Josiah Roberts and wife to Cropwell meeting. It was discouraging to see it so small and poor, yet there is a little remnant a little seed. Mariah Embree of Trenton was there and had a pretty deal to say and I thought it ended pretty well although I did not get relief fully. We went to Joseph Evans to dine Josiah Robert’s brother-in-law in the evening had a sitting with the large family of children; I believe to general good satisfaction.
21. I believe people are so accustomed to hear of their neighbors killing themselves with strong drink that there is less notice taken of it than if a wolf from the wilderness should come and kill a few sheep or if a bear should kill a few hogs and far less care to prevent it than there would be to preserve their sheep and hogs.
See <italic>Youth’s Instructor</italic> by George Dillwyn so far as a rational creature is conformed to the imitable attributes of his creator, so far and no farther is he advanced on the way to the highest happiness he is capable of. Joseph White said I never found that when I will did predominate in me that I ever stood rightly situated for divine instruction – so it appears that so far as we attend to the reproofs of instruction so far we are advanced towards the highest happiness we are capable of. Jacob saw a ladder whose top reached to heaven. <note resp="transcr">Genesis 28:12</note>  
22. Third Day, Thomas Grissel of Salem, State of Ohio, appointed a meeting. It was pretty full and he had sound doctrine and inquired what all we had heard had done for us etc. Not much animation; our people are used to hear sound doctrine: take heed how you hear [Mark 4:24] was the ancient caution.
23. Second Day. Thomas Story and George Keith both say to this effect that Quakerism, so called in derision, is no other than primitive Christianity revived in its ancient beauty after so long a night of gross darkness and apostasy.

12 of the Sixth Month, 1822; My daughter Abigail and I went to select quarterly meeting at Evesham and a poor, dull time it was. Weather very warm and we seemed to be overwhelmed with a lethargic stupor far from experiencing anything like sitting together in heavenly places or experiencing the powerful overshadowing of the Holy Ghost among us. Richard Jordan and divers others able ministers but chiefly shut up or nothing said so as to raise the life in the meeting.
13 was quarterly and very large; the house well filled and an appearance like a wealthy nation in carriages and costly array. I know not any people that can and do make such a show. We read he gave them their heart’s desire but sent leanness into their souls <note resp="transcr">Psalm 106:15</note>   and leanness poverty, death and barrenness did abound. Simon Gillum said considerable but in a complaining way. Richard Jordan quite shut up. We had the extracts read from the Yearly Meeting and the report of the Yearly Meeting committee both plentifully complaining of the weak, poor, low state of religion in many places. There were a number of ministers from different quarters and at last, divers lively, savory sentences dropped and I had some share amongst them to right good satisfaction and I thought it ended with a degree of the ownings of truth and savor of life – our worthy progenitors say Barclay and Penn: I think to this effects that churches nor assemblies councils nor synods can do nothing only whilst and when they keep under the guidance and influence of the right spirit: is there not great room to fear very many are sat down at the halfway house and taken up their residence at the town of morality quite contented with a life of morality without aiming to get to the city of the saints solemnity and heaven to themselves cisterns that can hold no water <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:13</note>  : and worship the works of their own hands that which their own fingers have made <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:8</note>  . A very dull drowsy time with many.
14. Deborah Howland from Oblong appointed a meeting at Moorestown. I was almost worn down two meetings two days past I thought I would omit going but our children seemed to wish to attend the meeting and I went with them forepart was some satisfactory but it did not end fully so to me I fear there was too much said by some and to me it did not end with that sweetness, nearness, and clothing [closing?] I could wish. The gardens and fields begin to be pinched with dry weather.
<pb id="A0011534_003"/>
16 of the Sixth Month, 1822. First Day. At our meeting and quite silent as there is five of us who frequently have something to say it is but seldom we have quite a silent meeting and I have been very jealous too seldom. There are two sorts of meetings and two sorts of silent meetings. One sort is the best of all sorts as Stephen Crisp says to have communion with God is something beyond all declarations or words in which there is no need of words. Repeatedly have I endeavored to point out this best of all sorts of meetings, but the will of the creature and his contrivance will not do neither in silence nor speaking; but acceptable worship is performed in true resignation and obedience as William Dewberry says it is in the will and contrivance of man all the mischief is hatched and as the prophet said they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider's web he that eateth their eggs dieth that which is crushed breaks out into a viper and as we read so they lap it up <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 59:5</note>  . George Dillwyn says the good condition of the sheep praises the pasture more than words can do. David says he leadeth me by the still waters and into green pastures <note resp="transcr">Psalm 23:2</note>  . But oh what is our condition and the state of religion amongst us: oh my leanness my leanness was the language of one of old and how many may adopt it in these days notwithstanding so much labor line upon line and precept upon precept not only here a little and there a little <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 28:10</note>   but here a great deal and there a great deal which we acknowledge to be very good. But alas, what hath it done for us is there any growth in vital religion among us so that I have thought of the lamentation over Jerusalem oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings but ye would not <note resp="transcr">Luke 13:34</note>   and of the woe pronounced against Chorazin: woe unto the Chorazin woe unto the Bethsaida if the great and mighty works which have been done in the had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes <note resp="transcr">Matthew 11:21</note>  . Some of our foremost I find are jealous that things will not always go on so but a time of trial an awakening, trying time will be permitted when poor, dry form only will not do any longer: labor not for the bread that perisheth but for that bread that nourisheth the soul up unto eternal life <note resp="transcr">John 6:27</note>   and again take no thought wherewithal shall be clothed <note resp="transcr">Matthew 6:31</note>  : But I thought if there was no more thought for the body than there is for the soul what would be our condition.
<pb id="A0011534_004"/>
20 of the Sixth [Month], 1822. At our meeting very small and forepart very trying to stand against an indolent trifling spirit. Although I had wearied myself too much before meeting I was favored to get over a spirit of heaviness and it ended to a good degree of satisfaction. preparative meeting.
23. First Day. I was reading John Woolman’s <italic>Works</italic>, see page 405. John Gratton in his journal, page 45, said the Lord is my portion I shall not want, he hath wrought all my works in me I am nothing but what I am in him. Next is an account of Gilbert Latey oh what a blessed state and glorious attainments did these servants of the Lord through the depths of self denial attain to – oh what poor dwarfs are we compared with them. But see the works of John Hoyland on the prophecies. See what misery ruin and destruction many nations, countries and cities brought on themselves for want of keeping humble and giving way to pride as Samuel Fothergill says pride has been the downfall of the greatest cities, empires and kingdoms that ever were erected in the world one reformation after another hath it destroyed: How many besides the city of Sodom, Tyre and Sidon do the Scriptures give accounts of land in utter ruins and desolation. See Hoyland’s 2 volume, page 97, they shall destroy the wall of Tyrus and break down her towers such hath been the fate of this once the most famous city in the world for trade and commerce on which this observation may be made: neither kingdoms nor commonwealths, neither public companies nor private persons can long carry on a beneficial flourishing trade without virtue and what virtue teacheth: sobriety, industry, frugality, modesty honesty, punctuality, humanity, charity, the love of our country and the fear of God – But see 1st volume, page 97, the blessed state of the righteous. No evil shall befall those who make the Lord their refuge and the most high their habitation. Neither shall any plague come nigh their habitation or dwelling: They need not fear the wreck of nature nor the crush of worlds: so it seem to read Job 5 and 15 verse and of Daniel and Shadreck, Mescheck and Abednego <note resp="transcr">Daniel 3 and 6</note>  . Went to our meeting. Sarah Cresson was there and preached till about 1 o’clock in a very sweet manner. Sung many to sleep as one prophesied there should be powerful preacher and dull hearers. Good sermons should be as music to a sleepy man and so it seems to be no tenderness, no contrition, no tears, but far from that dullness and drowsiness covered many: as if they was hearing a pleasant song of a pleasant voice.
<pb id="A0011534_005"/>
This 23 of the Sixth Month. After meeting Sarah Cresson and her brother Samuel and his wife and Samuel Church and wife and David Roberts and his wife, she is my brother Joshua’s daughter, came to see us although I am so poorly today that I can hardly keep up or enjoy my friends’ company. After tea we dropped into silence as Clarkson says our first Friends often did inadvertently when no one proposed it. So it was with us and Sarah did preach most sweetly a considerable time: since she has been restored from that most deplorable state of despondency. She is much more large and clear in her testimony than ever: restore me to the joy of thy salvation and uphold me by thy free spirit said David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 51:12</note>   she behaves most beautifully now: no behavior like that truth teaches I hope it was better than spending our time in talking and walking after things that do not profit <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:8</note>   which do not afford comfort, peace, and hope to reflect upon.
Third Day morning. See Hoyland’s 2 volume, page 379 no system of government however excellent in its fabric can possess any great measure of duration without that powerful cement, virtue, in the manners and principles of the people – the love of our country and the desire for its rational liberty are noble, virtuous feelings: but there is not any term which has been more prostituted than the word liberty. This day I went to my son John’s to get my wagon mended and this passage accompanied my mind sweetly see Ecclesiastes 9 chapter and 7 verse: go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for God now accepteth thy works one would wonder all the world do not hunger and thirst after righteousness – seeing there are so many precious blessings and promises recorded in Scripture for them: from the utmost parts of the earth have we heard songs even glory to the righteous they can say mercy and truth have met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other: truth is sprung out of the earth and righteousness looks down from Heaven <note resp="transcr">Psalm 85:10-11</note>   bread shall be given them their waters shall be sure <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 33:16</note>   the Lord is my portion I shall not want said John Gratton he hath wrought all my works in me <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 26:12</note>  , I am nothing but what I am in him again. It is said the angel of the Lord encampeth round about the righteous, and saveth them <note resp="transcr">Psalm 34:7</note>   but Paul tells how it fared with the wicked there and twenty thousand fall in one day <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 10:8</note>   and it is said the angel of the Lord is one night slew one hundred and four score and five thousand in one night for their wickedness <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 37:36</note>  . 
<pb id="A0011534_006"/>
Fourth Day morning. Very like for rain.
As I remarked before, 23 of the Sixth Month, First Day, Sarah Cresson was at our meeting and had a great deal to say I thought the states of the people or many of them was opened to my view but no time nor opening to mention it yet it illustrated and spread until it was an instructing lesson on to me: it appeared that many were like Martha who Christ said was careful about many things and too few like minded with Mary who had chosen the good part that should never be taken from her <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:41-2</note>  ; and some were like Achan and Gehazi <note resp="transcr">2 Kings 1:20-27</note>   coveting the golden wedge and the Babylonish garment <note resp="transcr">Joshua 7:21</note>  ; and many were like Demas who had embraced this present world <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 4:10</note>  , which is enmity with true religion. Some had made gold their hope and the fine gold their confidence; many had placed their affliction on things below and not on things above and direful has been the consequence of desires misplaced and like causes will always produce like effects. Many things indeed we poor mortals are very careful and busy about whilst the one thing needful is neglected, not considering how soon these many things which assume a mighty great importance and demand all our attention – may and must soon leave us or we must leave them as we see many do in the midst of their carrier as the man we read of whose ground brought forth plentifully and he concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years but it was said to him thou fool this night shall thy soul be required of thee and then whose shall these things be which thou hast provided. And so shall it be with all those who lay up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:19-21</note>   and again it is said as a partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and in the end become a fool <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 17:11</note>   and so I have seen it to be in many instances and how very different has their latter end been from those who like Mary who had chosen the good part that should never be taken from her <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:42</note>   or like David who so earnestly desired to be led in the way everlasting <note resp="transcr">Psalm 139:24</note>  . As I have heard from some who had embraced this present world and set their minds on things below, one said if I had my time to live over again it should not be as it has been; another said I have been careful to pay everyone his due and I have frequented religious meetings but as to the great business the great work of my souls salvation, I have never done so much as move the least grain of sand; another said at last now I must go and oh that I might go in peace; and many more like these who were counted good moralists but had been careful about many things and neglected the lone thing needful, seeking acceptance with their Maker.
<pb id="A0011534_007"/>
Seeking acceptance with our Maker is not that the one thing needful above all others and the only way that is lasting as David calls it the way everlasting, but for want of such in after this one thing needful this way everlasting and choosing the good part as Mary did. Oh to see and think what a most miserable, unhappy like very many live wearying out their days with sorrow, misery, and affliction; but oh the blessed and happy state of those who seek after the one thing needful acceptance with their Maker: see Ecclesiastes 9 and 7 go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for God now accepth thy works. Here indeed is experienced that saying that prosperity is redoubled to a good man for what joys or pleasures, riches, or treasure (of this world) can equal a secret sense of acceptance with God who alone could say and can say neither grace nor glory nor any good thing shall be withheld from them that seek first the Kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof (the one thing the most needful) all things needful shall be added. Job says when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me because I deliver the poor that cried and him that had none to help him: the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon one and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame I was a father to the poor and the cause which I knew not I searched out: they will <note resp="transcr">Job 29:11-16</note>   – the righteous flourish like a tree planted by the rivers of water. And is not this the way everlasting the way to live to purpose to the greatest and most noble and most glorious of purposes without which to what purpose do we live.
To man in a savage, uncultivated state the earth is an abode of desolation where shelter is insufficient and even food precarious see Hoyland’s first volume page 46, see the sentence above bountiful as is the hand of providence his gifts are not so bestowed as to seduce us into idleness but are calculated to rouse exertion.

3 of the Sixth [Month], 1822. Was First Day. I sat off early and went to see Job Cole’s wife in a very weak, low, poor state of health; seems almost worn away to skin and bone although she has been a very fat corpulent body. She is so weak she cannot bear but little company. Then I went to Haddonfield to see my old acquaintance Kester Laning a poor old widow who has been blind near twenty years now almost worn away, aged 83; they expressed gladness in the visit. Then I went to Haddonfield meeting which was but small and a zeal for religion very low, yet it was through unmerited mercy the most open, owning time I ever had there till near one o’ clock and when we came out we were favored with that precious cement: openness, sweetness, kindness, and feeling nearness, hearty, inviting, kindness all new after meeting. I went to see another poor, ancient widow almost worn away to skin and bone; both these last upwards of eighty and one maintained by our meeting. Last Fifth Day I went to see Joseph Cowperthwaite near 30 years of age he has been in a wasting, declining state of health his several years but now reduced to almost skin and bone I got well home but was very much wearied when I got from Haddonfield.
I read the news but little and really I am afraid of them [i.e., newspapers]: they come to the house as raping papers. I picked up one the other day I think it is said 36 died in one week with the consumption in the City of New York and also in Philadelphia many die with it.
Third Day morning I was reading in William Penn’s <italic>Select Works</italic>  but it is so big and heavy we very seldom take it up, see page 463: Oh the lowness and meanness of those spirits that despise or neglect the joys and glories of immortality for the sake of the things that are seen; that are but temporal debasing the nobility of their souls abandoning the government of the Divine spirit and embracing with all ardency of affection the sensual pleasures of this life but such as persevere therein, shall not enter into God’s rest forever: how many millions there are as William Penn says who have set their hearts and affections on things below how many could I mention who whilst they lived were careful about many things; wrenching both brains and back scuffling scrambling early and late who have been snatched away in the midst of their days, and some who lived to old age and devoted health and strength time and talents to accumulate wealth, which I see has made wings for their offspring and some of them have scattered their estates faster than their fathers and grandfather ever gathered it. Miserable folly indeed to devote all their time strength and talents: in providing for the body which is but of a few days and full of trouble and to neglect that of laying up treasures for eternity seriously to think of it what weakness and folly appears.
[marginal note] 14 of the Second Month. Elizabeth Coal was buried; she has been wasting by degrees some months.

{1822-07}
3rd of the Seventh Month, 1822. A fine, soaking rain it has been several weeks very pinching, dry weather here away there has been very often great signs of rain and went off with very little till now this is the height of harvest and as far as I can learn a very good harvest in general although the winter was a very hard one both for winter grain and meadows hard frost and little snow: grass is said to be generally very light and like to be very scarce Indian corn looks very promising seldom if ever more so. 
This 3rd of the Seventh Month. We were invited to the burial of Hannah Yarnall, my wife’s sister Elizabeth’s daughter about 58 she has seen a great deal of trouble buried two husbands; and her father-in-law, James Thorington. She and her mother used to live with us when she was a little girl. She attained to the station of a reputable, acceptable minister and traveled considerable abroad and in particular that of visiting families. She has been but weakly and suffered much of latter time with the gavel but it is said her last disorder was something like the dysentery. We were not able to attend the burial.
I have often thought what very desirable things wisdom and riches are amongst men: that there are according to Scripture two sorts of wisdom and two sorts of riches: the wisdom that is from above is said to be pure, peaceable, and gentle and easy to be entreated and devilish <note resp="transcr">James 3:15-17</note>   – one sort of riches is called in Scripture the true riches, durable riches, etc. <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 8:18</note>  . But Solomon says there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 13:7</note>  . Is it wisdom in men of understanding to set their hearts and minds and affections on things below taking more cost and pains to lay up treasures on earth which can be enjoyed for a very little while: than Heavenly treasures would cost them as William Penn says, Oh, the baseness and meanness of those spirits, spirits that despises or neglect the joys and glories of immortality for the things that are seen, which are but temporal, debasing the nobility of their souls, abandoning the government of this Divine Spirit, and embracing with all ardency the sensual pleasures of this life but such as persevere therein shall never enter into God’s rest. Was he, who we read of, who concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years a wise man no he was called a fool and it was said to him this nigh shall thy soul be required of thee and then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:19-21</note>  .
[marginal note] It makes me think how religion is treated by us like.

<pb id="A0011534_010"/>
I was once with a sick man near the solemn close and he was counted a wise man and his language was oh this world, this world, it is the merest cheat and how many millions have been undone and cheated by it since the days of Balaam who it is said loved the wags of unrighteousness <note resp="transcr">2 Peter 2:15</note>   and like Achan and Gehazi <note resp="transcr">2 Kings 1:20-27</note>   who coveted the golden wedg and Babylonish garment <note resp="transcr">Joshua 7:21</note>   and like Demas who abandoned the Lord’s cause and the government of the Divine spirit <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 4:10</note>   or like Judas who sold his master for 30 pieces of silver and was his own executioner for he went out and hanged himself <note resp="transcr">Matthew 27:5</note>  . It appeared to me this afternoon as a matter of wonder that so many thousands and millions of people should be so much like Martha of old careful about many things and so neglect the one thing needful the good part which Mary chose and Christ said should never be taken from her <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:41-42</note>  ; especially when I consider how evidently it is demonstrated in numberless numbers of things and instances the wisdom there is above all things, to save up for ourselves treasures in Heaven, and on the other hand the unspeakable folly in neglecting it. To take this subject into serious consideration, the desire people have to obtain riches and wisdom would open a large field for consideration, meditation, and contemplation. But in short what a blessed thing it would be if all people would make choice of that riches which is durable and of that wisdom which is profitable to direct whereby the frowned and the disobedient are turned to the wisdom of the just: see Psalms 73, 22 verse: So foolish was I and ignorant I was as a beast; before thee some have compared the state of the worldly minded man to the state of Nebuchadnezzar at grass when a beast’s heart was given him <note resp="transcr">Daniel 4:33</note>  ; be ye not like the horse or as the mule that hath no understanding said David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 32:9</note>  ; no sight or sense taste nor feeling or desires after Heavenly treasures oh earth earth hear oh earth etc <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>  . Nothing like the state and disposition David felt when he said as the heart panteth after the water brooks so doth my soul after thee O Lord <note resp="transcr">Psalm 42:1</note>   etc.; and again he says let my right hand forget her cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth and if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chiefest joys <note resp="transcr">Psalm 137:5-6</note>  ; and again see the command from highest authority if thy right hand offend thee cut it off or if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out <note resp="transcr">Matthew 5:29-30</note>  ; is not the state of those who have set their affections on things below very different from this; did Moses make a foolish choice when he refused the riches and honors of Pharaoh’s court and chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season: a short season <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 11:25-26</note>  .
<pb id="A0011534_011"/>
See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>Power of Religion on the Mind</italic> by John Gough, page 70: the continual troubles and discomposures, sickness and calamities that attend our lives, the shortness and continued vexations occurring in them, and finally the common examples of death and mortality of all ages and sexes and conditions of mankind are sufficient instruction to convince reasonable men who have the seriousness and patience to consider and observe that we have no abiding city here and on the other side. If we will but give ourselves leisure to consider the great wisdom of almighty God who orders everything in the world to ends suitable and proportionable, the excellency of the soul and mind of man, the great advances and improvements his nature is capable of, the admirable means which the merciful wise God hath afforded mankind by his works of nature and providence by his word and instruments to qualify him for a nobler life than this world below can yield. We shall readily confess that there is another state, another city to come: which it becomes every good and wise and considerate man to look after and fit himself for and yet if we look up on the generosity of mankind with a due consideration they will appear to be like a company of distempered people; the greatest part of them make it their whole business to provide for a rest and happiness in this world. They make these vain of acquests wealth and honor, the preferments of this world their great if not their only business and happiness: and which is yet a higher degree of frenzy; they esteem this the only wisdom and judge the careful provision for eternity the folly of a few weak, melancholy, fanciful men. Where was it is a truth and in due time it will evidently appear that those men who are most solicitous for the attaining of their everlasting rest are the only truly wise men and so shall be acknowledged by those that now despise them – we fools counted his life madness and his end to be without honor how is he numbered among the children of God and his lot among the saints.
4th of the Seventh Month, 1822. At our Monthly Meeting and I think it was a – Pretty good one Joseph Foulk of Gwynned was there and had acceptable service in the afternoon there were some close, pertinent, lively – remarks and sentences to my satisfaction.
5. Joseph Foulk and wife come to see us and we went with them to Evesham Monthly Meeting, which was small in midst of harvest. The persecutors of our first Friends used to say they would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground; they esteemed the Lord’s favor more than their necessary food but such a demonstration of zeal was wanting here yet some room for labor to satisfaction. Some of their elders said they hardly knowed a more lively time but I thought things was low.
[marginal note] Words of Matthew Hale.
[marginal note] We spent the afternoon at Hinchman Haines with Joseph Foulk and wife, not so well as I could wish but that is nothing new.
<pb id="A0011534_012"/>
6th of the Seventh Month. Was Seventh Day evening see Hoyland’s 1st volume, page 237. Joseph became an illustrious example of a mind unsubdued by deepest distress, uncorrupted by the highest degree of elevation (how many thousands have fallen under such proving trials). His afflictions commenced at an early period of life; it was in its kind peculiarly better and severe; it came from a quarter which was the least to be apprehended and the transition was instantaneous: from a tranquility that knew no bounds, to anguish which no language can express, no imagination can conceive. Do we not read that it is through tribulation we must enter the kingdom if ever <note resp="transcr">Acts 14:22</note>   and again these are they that have come through great tribulation and worked their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb <note resp="transcr">Revelation 7:14</note>  . What I would chiefly remark upon all this is our precarious standing as on a sea of glass mingled with fur and the great need there is of our having the favor of that all powerful being who only can preserve through all the greatest snares and dangers as in the case of Noah, Jonah, Joseph, and Jacob; Lot and Job, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and all the rest of the faithful servants of the Lord. How sudden indeed are the transitions, many times from the greatest riches to the greatest poverty, degradation and contempt as in the case of Haman and many others; and [no] language can express, no imagination can conceive and from a state of perfect health to a languishing bed and to the grave but see 1 volume of Hoyland’s words page 97, no evil shall befall them that make the Lord their refuge and the most high their habitation – they need not fear the wreck of nature nor the crush of worlds; see what was said to Job Chapter 5 and from 15 verse to the end and of Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and of the deliverance of all the rest. He stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire out of weakness they were made strong and put the armies of the aliens to flight <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 11:34</note>   triumphed over all their enemies and had the victory over death, hell, and the grave; so says Seneca that if the earth should open her mouth and show a righteous man all the secrets of the infernal pit he would look down upon it without dismay, so it appears to read the accounts of the martyrs and Mary Dyer who could rejoice in the most dismal prospects of misery and sufferings through that Almighty power that caused Paul and Silas to sing in prison and their feet fast in the stocks <note resp="transcr">Acts 16:25</note>  ; like Habakkuk although the fields should yield no meat yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>   midst of harvest.

7th of the Seventh Month, 1822. First Day wet weather at our meeting. Thomas Kite of Philadelphia was there a considerable, smart, lively minister but all was silent; until it was time to break up I said a little and have no cause to repent it; and Thomas at last said something about the dullness and drowsiness that prevailed and also E. Roberts. It was as a poor, dull, shut up, time, midst of harvest. Weather very warm; people work hard, weary in the heat, and when they come and sit down still, nature calls for rest and. Ross observed yet at last I thought there was some savory concern appeared.
Third Day. See George Dillwyn’s <italic>Youth’s Instructor</italic>, page 105, To stand approved in the sight of omniscience, is the only desire which is not delusive: and it is comfortable to believe that of this desire, and consequently its entire satisfaction, every accountable being is as capable, as he is conscious of his existence and want of happiness; and as this desire to stand approved is the most important, supreme, interesting desire that ever did on will or possibly can engage the mind of mankind. Is it not strange that more people do not study to shew themselves approved in the sight of God like one formerly who said I will not give sleep to mine eyes nor slumber to mine eyelids until I find a place for the God of Jacob <note resp="transcr">Psalm 132:4</note>   to dwell in seeing our state is so very precarious and unsafe and we such miserable creatures without the Lord’s favor.
Fourth Day. See Samuel Bownas’s <italic>Advice to Ministers and Elders</italic> page 102, he says the education, though with the strictest care and tenderness administered, will not answer what some expect from it. As to the grounding of youth in true religion and saving faith: for nothing short of the work of grace in the heart, the new birth, and the washing of regeneration by the word can make a sound right Christian and a true minister. Tertullian used to say if people depart from the discipline of the cross they cease among us to be called Christian but if that was our rule how many would it divest of that noble title in our days, how many millions are great stranger to this sort of talk about the work of grace or the new birth who concludes: they are very good Christians without understanding
<pb id="A0011534_014"/>
understanding  anything about such talk as that as one observes if they can but live on prosperity and be kept clear of gross enormities they sit down at ease and conclude all is safe and well. But oh that they may find out their mistake before it is too late, says that worthy minister Sarah Morris, what unspeakable numbers are quite contented and wholly at ease and quiet with a life of mere morality without ever so much as wishing or desiring to be acquainted with the inward life the hidden life the life of God in the soul of man, or even so much as seeing or thinking it necessary. Yet how many of these who have obtained a character amongst men and made it their chief concern to accumulate wealth and lay up treasures on earth and could say at last when they were just about to launch into the unknown regions of eternity, they had goods laid up in store for many years yet like the foolish virgins no oil in their lamps <note resp="transcr">Matthew 25:1-3</note>  . And this was the language of one who bore the character of a moral honest man and no one could say anything against him, only he was too greedy after the world and his last words were oh darkness darkness darkness and so died away another very innocent, hard working, worldly-minded, money-getting man. At last said now I must go and oh that I might go in peace and they have preserved the words of another moral man in good credit amongst his neighbors but had not been enough – concerned shew himself approved in the sight of God then thousands of worlds would not tempt me to live in the world as I have done again another as I have heard ten thousands of worlds would I now give if it was in my power for peace with the Lord. Blessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law delights to meditate both day and night; he shall be as a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his leaf shall not wither [Psalm 1:1-3]. Without something of this sort one counted it a mere animal life and indeed is it not that only which distinguishes a man from a beast, beasts have no capacity gifts nor abilities to commune with their Maker, but there is a spirit in man and it is the inspiration of the almighty that giveth them an understanding and is the superior gift ever bestowed on mankind and to have communion with God, the superior excellency of the Christian religion, but how many there are that have no ears to hear such talk until they find they must leave this world.
[marginal note] But how different is the death of the righteous: all light all like all joy and all peace.

11th of the Seventh Month, 1822. Fifth Day. At our meeting which was very small midst of harvest. The persecutors said of our first Friends that they would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground, but we do not manifest such a preference to truth’s cause now in these days. It was not only small but very poor, dull, and drowsy waters too low to attempt to go a step. We have many things that call for our care and attention for both soul and body the call of the Lord is gone forth as in days of old after divers ways and divers manners but it appears the world’s calls outbids all, but how will that do when every source and prop of earthly comfort fails, which they surely will sooner or later. And we see they often do in many instances all round us daily, see James 4 and 4 the friendship of this world is enmity to God. Not all the persecutors and open apostates that ever rose up against us ever has done us that hurt as prosperity has done said one of our worthy progenitors; another in my hearing said that the unlawful love of lawful things was the greatest snare ever the Devil had to catch Quakers. As William Penn expresses it a more subtle crafty snare the crafty Devil never had to catch people than the allurements of this world so earthly mindedness brings darkness, feebleness, weakness so many meetings have grown weakly and sickly and so have dwindled, withered, and died away and their meetings have dropped and their meeting houses left desolate, a habitation for the little owls, the moles and the bats, as I have seen to be the case with us after all the labor bestowed upon us; the Lord is with you whilst you be with him if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you said Azariah <note resp="transcr">2 Chronicles 15:2</note>  . They that pursue lying vanities forsake their own mercies <note resp="transcr">Jonah 2:8</note>  . Will not all prove at last lying vanities but the one thing needful, all find out what that is at last; without that all cry vanity. They that cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue them, will they not have to adopt this language woe is me that I dwell in Meshach and sojourn in the tents of Kedar <note resp="transcr">Psalm 120:5</note>  : arise depart hence for this is not the place of true rest it is polluted <note resp="transcr">Micah 2:10</note>   and so many find it too late a fine soaking rain.

14 of the Seventh Month. First Day. I heard lately of the death of William Blake: a worthy minister my old acquaintance and fellow traveler about 1814. He and Oliver Paxton, an elder in good esteem, and I went to visit the people at Stroudsburg about  miles up Delaware. Oliver has been dead several years and a very good memorial since printed concerning him. I think Oliver and William Blake were both some little younger than me.
[marginal note] How sorrowful many have no concern about preparing for the other world until they find they can stay no longer in this as William Penn observes.
14th of the Seventh Month 22 First Day. My children went with me to Cropwell meeting which was small, poor, and low. George Dillywn, see page 26, <italic>Youth’s Instructor</italic>, where vice rules, virtue is in disgrace and how is it where the world rules. The apostle James says 4 and 4 the friendship of the world is enmity to God: such farms and fields of corn anywhere are hardly to be found as there is about Cropwell ye are the Lord’s husbandry no growth in religion poor, dry formality yet as in Sardis there are a few names who have not defiled their garments [Revelation 3:4] not bowed the knee to ball: I had a pretty open time amongst them but some of them can hardly bear anything said against great Diaura although there appeared to be something owning there was not that sweet cement as at some times the unlawful love of lawful things Thomas Ross said was the greatest snare ever the devil had to catch Quakers the lovers of the world are not drunkards but which of the two has been the greatest enemy and hindrance to religion the great works of the Reformation – William Penn and Peter Charron both mention Cyrus (whom the Lord calls his shepherd) they say Cyrus would not suffer his people to remove from their poor, barren soil to a country more rich and fertile for fear they should be corrupted by luxury and ease as the people of Sodom were charged with pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness [Ezekiel 16:49]: Can we clear ourselves of abundance of spiritual idleness the primitive Christians used to say prosperity was a very intoxicating thing and few brains were strong enough to bear it and few since the days of Job and Abraham have ever bourn prosperity unhurt uncontaminated hence the caution of worldly wealth beware a little is enough too much a snare so it has proved to many as the apostle observes drowned many in destruction and perdition <note resp="transcr">1 Timothy 6:9</note>  : man wants but little here nor wants that little long: oh earth earth hear oh earth <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>   Samuel Fothergill says no state harder to reach than those whose minds are buried in the earth they have had line upon line, precept upon precept, and does it not seem as if it is like pouring water on a rock all runs of and makes no impression oh Jerusalem how often would I have gathered thee <note resp="transcr">Matthew 23:37</note>  . Remember the language to some of old: go to the gods whom ye have chosen let them deliver you if they can etc. <note resp="transcr">Judges 10:14</note>  : be thou instructed oh Jerusalem lest I make thee desolate <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 6:8</note>  .

18th of the Seventh Month, 1822. Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and very poor although I thought not so drowsy as some. I had a feeling a little like Robert Nezbet after he had been delivering some close doctrine said now I feel as If you could not hurt me and as Stephen Crisp says if I can but answer my own conscience I need fear no man yet no safety but in true humility as one says humility the spring of virtue is: Humble thyself and virtue thou cannot miss: We called to see Joseph Cowperthwaite in a deep decline, reduced to skin and bone almost. One handed me a newspaper giving an account of scarcity of bread that they believed some had starved to death for want of it they say there is accounts of their grievous distressed suffering in almost every paper and there is accounts of the great drought and failings of crops this harvest in New England Massachusetts and there away and also accounts of most dreadful wars, cruelty and barbarity in Smyrna. Oh how destitute of that all powerful preserving Christian principle are innumerable multitudes of dark heathen nations now groaning under gross darkness, idolatry and superstition and what is there that can preserve them from thus destroying, murdering and massacring one another as they do but obedience to that light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. So see here the fruits and effects of the want of obedience. Famine, sword and pestilence sore judgments with which the people have been visited for their wickedness and disobedience in ages and nations past down to these days. Like cases produce like effects – it is a great mercy the Christian religion hath so far prevailed amongst us that we are preserved from such dreadful customs, superstition and idolatry, tumults, bustling outrageous massacring and murdering as we hear and read of amongst the heathen nations in many places where the Christian religion is but little professed and less practiced.

Seventh Day evening. It is appointed for all men once to die but the time when the place where and the manner how is a secret many are drowned and we see some get burned to death very strangely indeed who to all appearance were as safe from danger as their neighbors or fellow creatures how many could I mention whose situation in life appeared as safe from danger as any: who have been some drowned and some burned to death. Divers of my neighbors and old schoolmates have starved to death as those believed who nursed them; some struck with the palsy and disabled from eating and some their mouths eaten away with cancers and numberless numbers of other ways there is but one way for people to come into world but very many ways for them to go out of it. From Scripture and other accounts how many thousand have fell by that word in one day how many thousands have perished by famine and the multitudes that have been swept away in a short time by the pestilence and the many thousands that have perished in a few minutes by earthquakes and Paul says three and twenty thousand fell in one day for their wickedness <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 10:8</note>   and again we read the angel of the Lord went out and slew in the Assyrian camp an hundred and four score and five thousand in one night <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 37:36</note>  . Happy for they who can say as one I have read of that he did not fear death in whatever way it might attack or approach him like Daniel, Shadreck, Masheck and Abeidnego and thousands of others of faithful martyrs and others of the faithful servants of the Lord as Hoyland’s says they need not fear the crush of worlds and as Seneca says if the earth should open its mouth and there them all the secrets of the infernal pit they would look down upon it without dismay who would not deliver to the very uttermost as the Scriptures abundantly testify.
21. First Day. At our meeting as to myself silent and I am not quite sure it was best it was so but it is best to miss it on that hand than be a babbler for Solomon says the serpent will bite and a babbler is no better. <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 10:11</note>   Said a good deal and I thought it end pretty well.
[marginal note] Several have been scalded to death in their distilling spirituous liquors. Two burnt to death dressing flax.

23rd Third Day. See [Lindley Murray’s] <italic>English Reader</italic>, page 150, on the slavery of vice having no fund within himself whence to draw enjoyment his only recourse is in things without he partakes in all its vicissitudes and is moved and shaken by every wind of fortune this is to be in the strictest sense a slave to the world but shall I call that man free who has nothing of his own no property ensured: whose very heart is not his own: If the truth hath made the free then art thou free indeed so we read in Scripture: But believe it no chain bind so hard no fetters are so heavy as those which fasten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world no dependence is more contemptible than that under which vice promises as the recompense of setting us free from the salutary restraints of virtue: Blair
It is recorded in Scripture as the call of the Lord my son give me thy heart if the heart is for the Lord all is for him whither eating drinking marry or giving in marriage that if the heart is not for the Lord then there is nothing for him for what has man to give to the lord but his heart but oh how many are following after their lovers but can never overtake them their way being hedged up with thorns and their hearts sold to work wickedness: this was the query to some of old to which of my creditors have I sold you verily for your wickedness have ye sold yourselves <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 50:1</note>   – thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 4:30</note>   is it not so said in Scripture: But that is the way of Satan first allure them with his temptations and then when he has ensnared them torment them when he has done: this is the reward of poor sinners who serve that hard master: see the words of John Hawksworth one noted for his great natural abilities. See [Lindley] Murray’s <italic>Sequel </italic>some account of him, page 272: sin hath no beginning but from pride nor fall but from humility: consider the different fruits and effects of both pride and humility: pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall but humility goes before honor the one has plunged people into the most miserable and unhappy state and the other raised them to the most happy.

Fourth Day Morning. See Paul’s Epistle to the Colossians 1st and 12: give thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the Kingdom of his dear son what a blessed state and most glorious attainment: how very far from it are very many thousands and millions in different nations a young man a native of this place has just returned from sea and has been gone four or five years and has been to divers different nations Italy, Turkey, and divers others he tells me they are all together of the Papish religion and that he found savage like spirits and dispositions amongst them: and that of latter time most terrible sickness and great mortality prevails in various nations: in one nation a pestilential fever carries them off by hundreds many hundreds in a day and in other places a disorder something like the dysentery or flax purging and lax what the doctors call colery morbus sweeps them of in multitudes with very short illness. It is to be feared these multitudes of people never had very little if any opportunity of acquaintance with that religion that Paul speaks of that had brought him and them in his days to such a blessed and glorious safe and happy state what a lamentable pity it is that people who have the offer and means held out to their acceptance: of acquaintance with that religion which has been such a blessing to thousands and millions innumerable what a pity any should be so unwise like Esau of old not know how to set a price upon and so sell it for a morsel of meat <note resp="transcr">Genesis 25:32-34</note>  : then at last seek it with tears too late to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent is life eternal and again acquaint now thyself with him and beat peace but oh the estrangedness how little acquainted with that powerful influence of Heavenly goodness that supported and sustained and comforted the martyrs and our first Friends under all their great sufferings and trials.
25. Fifth Day. A fine soaking rain last night a fine time for the Indian corn and buckwheat to grow: and a promising prospect.
27. Seventh Day. Finished getting hay.
28. First Day. At our meeting not so dull and heavy as some of late I went to see Joseph Cowperthwaite so weak and low he can hardly speak so as to be heard there was a number of neighbors there and we had a little meeting with him for the better I hope it is satisfactory to look over the day – rain again

29th Seventh Month, Second Day morning. I have seen dreadful accounts of sorrows on the seas of late as well as on land a vessel filed out on a whaling voyage from Nantucket after good success when they had procured 700 barrels of oil were afterwards shipwrecked by a mighty great whale running against their vessel with such force it caused it to let in the water so that as many as could get into their boats were in them exposed to the open sea until they were famished to death after casting lots and eating one another. Dismal is the account of their sufferings and perishing with hunger full as much so as their sufferings in Ireland of late: sorrows on land and sorrows on the seas what poor frail creatures we are. To what a state of sorrow and misery not only individuals but whole nations may suddenly be brought and after are what room is there for pride and yet how greatly does it abound what voyages they will make what journeys they will take for earthly treasures: and to accumulate wealth and lay up treasures on earth take more pains than heaven would cost them – 
11 of the First Month, 1789. I find a note in my memorandum back some Expressions of a minister preserved by John Rutty in his spiritual diary page 164, what a bigerly [niggardly?] contemptible thing would it be for any who through laziness or pride would not dig nor work for themselves – to be lounging about the doors of the rich and depend upon them for food if this be a pitiful and contemptible situation in a temporal relation see whether it be not that of several of yours in a spiritual: Even you who by your gesture manifest an uneasy expectation of being fed with words: whilst you will not beg of God himself as you ought to do with prostrated souls: I have thought none more idle and unconcerned about their souls than those who are most engaged in a care for the poor body: although the Scriptures say take no thought for that <note resp="transcr">continued below in single contiguous paragraph</note>  
[marginal note] A vessel from New England filed out.
<pb id="A0011534_022"/>
and as a worthy able minister says to dig too idle and to beg too proud <note resp="transcr">Luke 16:3</note> : yet under name of stewards feign would shroud: I once heard my cousin William Hunt that great minister once ask the people, children, says he, have you any bread? You look too idle to work for your living you look to me to be a lazy, idle pack and so it proved to be for their meeting was lost died away and come to perish. I heard that he once told the people that they knew now more about religion than his old horse. That their offerings stinked they were fit for nothing but the crows and the buzzards a lukewarm state is as loathsome as open profaneness be ye not like the horse or the mule that hath no understanding said David <note resp="transcr">Psalm 32:9</note>   and again he says when the Lord restored again the captivity of Zion we were as those who dream <note resp="transcr">Psalm 126:1</note>   and are not many in that dreaming state about religion: like the horse or the mule no concern about the great business of man’s life which is to answer the end for which he was sent it is better to wear away than rust away: man’s understanding dulled with idleness: contracts a rust which makes it daily less and less and to how many in our day may it be said ye are idle ye are idle <note resp="transcr">Exodus 5:17</note>   although worn down with a care and toil for the poor moldering body: o Earth Earth hear o Earth <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>   etc.
23. Third Day I went to see Nehemiah Matlack far advanced in years 75 and very infirm many years past with the gravel and went to see Thomas Glover a young man very ill with a fever had lately hurt himself with strong drink: I am told there was house struck with thunder a few days ago in Philadelphia and shattered very much: and that there was two horses killed with the thunder near Cooper’s Ferry. We have had but very little hard thunder here of late to what we used to have some summers years back. A man of Evesham just returned from a journey informs that in the western country Miommi [Miami?] there is a great drought very pinching, dry weather and that it is very likely.
Three or four and more died out of one house with the dysentery or flux it was said to be much in that country last year.
[marginal note] I am told the thunder melted the pewter in the house but nobody hurt.

1st of the Eighth Month, 1822. 5 Day. At our meeting small but not quite the poorest not so drowsy as in the midst of harvest and hay come off without condemnation if our hearts condemn us not then have we – confidence towards God <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:21</note>   said one of old time but alas when we are right how unable we are of ourselves to keep so what humility and watchfulness fear care and prayer: to keep so oh that thine hand might be with me and keep me from evil said good old Jabez <note resp="transcr">1 Chronicles 4:10</note>  . 
We have had a plentiful season here for grass and grain although in the forepart it looked discouraging Indian corn seldom ever looked more promising here away but both east and west in New England and Miami westward travelers say there is pinching, dry weather and we hear that in Ireland they are starving to death for want of bread what poor morals we are and to what a state of wretchedness and misery not only individuals but whole nations often times are soon brought.
Seventh Day. I continue to hear of the distresses in Ireland it is said I suppose it is in the news that they are known to dig up their potatoes after they planted them they were so pinched with hunger and that they plucked the wheat before it was ripe and even gnawed the bark of trees: is there any room for pride at such a time as this world it not after many lofty looks if such a pinching time should overtake us.
4 of the Eighth Month, first Day. As to myself silent Joseph Justice had a great deal to say and I hope it ended reputably looks very like for rain several days but all goes off.
8 of the Eighth Month. At our Monthly Meeting. The quarterly meeting’s committee appointed to attend the Monthly Meeting and to labor for a reformation against the many wrong things that generally prevail earthly mindedness, pride, and superfluity neglect of meetings to unnecessary use of strong drink, etc. Samuel Leeds of Egg Harbor was one of them and had very extensive, pertinent, savory, acceptable, lively service and there was a covering of solemnity savor of life and ownings of truth throughout a favored day Hinchman Haines and wife and Brother and Samuel Leeds paid me a visit and a remarkable one it was I had such an open time with his brother Rubin Haines I believe will not soon be forgotten he had been disowned and it was admirable how things and the way opened to impart to him such things as he stood in need of he is a smart sensible man and he took it all in good part and he and Samuel Leeds expressed good satisfaction with coming to see me which was on Fourth day last I counted it a favor for it is too rare or seldom our social visits is too much profit.

9. We went to the burial of Joseph Cowperthwaite aged near 30 perhaps he has been wasting and wearing away this several years with a gradual decline of health or consumption he had appeared in the ministry several years savory and acceptable till towards his solemn close and there seemed room to think from some of his expression of the happiness he felt near the last beyond anything he had ever felt in his life that he made a happy change he had been out to neighboring meetings with me of latter time at the house the people were very orderly and silent none of that of talking and whispering together like they used to be at burials but oh, the poverty and leanness nothing to be seen nor felt of that quickening spirit that makes alive unto God there were several of our ministers there but all shut up. But at the close at the grave I had a pretty open, lively time to good satisfaction. Dry weather.
11. First Day. Hannah brought some more religious tract from market some of them are most excellent it seems as if they would sow the world with them: Light is sown for the righteous and joy and gladness for the upright in heart <note resp="transcr">Psalm 97:11</note>  : in one of these religious tracts is an account of the faith and constancy of the martyrs: Even that faith which – overcome the world as Daniel, Shadreck and Mesheck and Abednego did see some words of John Philpot’s after exhorting his friends to keep the faith once delivered to the saints: he said to one the world wonders how we can be merry in such extreme misery but our God is omnipotent who turneth misery into felicity: believe me there is no such joy in the world as the people of Christ have under the cross I speak by experience therefore believe me and fear nothing the world can do unto you what greater joy can there be then to be in conformity to Christ: then I say what must their state be who are in conformity to the world contrary the express command be ye not conformed to this world <note resp="transcr">Romans 12:2</note>   for the friendship of this world and a carnal mind are enmity to God <note resp="transcr">Romans 8:7</note>   says the apostles: so Stephen Crisp says the world wondered our leaf did not wither under our great sufferings now to our [entry ends]

This 11th of the Eighth Month, 1822, at our meeting and a precious good one it was or else some of us were mistaken. Amos Peasly of Crosswicks and Hinchman Haines were there and an open owning savory time it seemed to be I had some share in the travel to good satisfaction there were some friends from different parts of Sadsbury near Susquehanna River and some from Gwynned and some and some from eastward towards Trentown [Trenton]. One of these strangers said it was comfortable being with us I fear we do not consider what a favor it is to have a free gospel ministry whilst very many are such vast expanse with their ministers Amos Peasly is an able worthy great minister our meeting ended sweet and savory what a blessed thing it is for them that can say with Caleb of old see Joshua 14 and 11th: I am this day four score and five years old said Caleb and as strong for war as ever see the promises to the righteous in old age they shall be fat and flourishing and their leaf shall not wither but shall still bring forth fruit in old age but alas how many wither and grow useless and worthless lean, poor, and withered dry and formal: these strangers inform us that sickness – abounds and great mortality in divers parts of Pennsylvania in Chester County and Bucks County in some places three and four die out of a house with the dysentery and complaint in the bowels – Collare Morbus and typhus fevers and they say that the news gives accounts of these disorders being very exceeding mortal in other distant nations: and that in divers places the drought is so piercing that their Indian corn is dried up and they have cut it up for fodder and lowed the ground and now the dry weather seems likely to cut of the buckwheat and potatoes and although our corn here away looked so promising the dry weather coming on will cut of thousands of bushels amongst us and they tell me that in Chester County the springs are so dried up that water is sold at West Chester for a 11 penny bit a barrel we read of water and wood being sold to the people in Scripture <note resp="transcr">Lamentations 5:4</note>   but I do not remember of ever hearing of the like before in America this afternoon we spent with the widow Anne Cowperthwaite and large family and children 2 daughters from Pennsylvania being there we had a sitting with them I hope for the better I have been very intimate with the family from my childhood.
15. Eighth Month. At our meeting. Rebekah Price, an ancient friend of Philadelphia, had acceptable service and my wife thinks there was a better feeling than common though a small meeting.
[marginal note] a shower north of us but little here.

18th of the Eighth Month. First Day. At our meeting all shut up but old Rebekah Price of Philadelphia I suppose it would be allowed that she did very well but alas I thought I seldom seen meeting more destitute of life or the owning of truth we attended very warm and so unwell I could hardly sit meeting.
Nathan Smith and wife and William Evans and his wife paid us a visit which I should hardly think worth noticing only that it was to satisfaction which social visits too seldom are for want of something that only can make any opportunities satisfactory. Nathan had a sitting with us and I hope for the better he has been much under the weather. Brought under great trouble by the bad conduct of his children but seems to not yet quite lost all his preaching when he gets up here amongst his old friends.
22. Fifth Day I went to Evesham meeting which was not very small Nathan Smith was there and I thought we had an open favored Lively time almost as ever: there seemed to be something of that precious cement openness sweetness and feeling nearness and brotherly kindness: at our son John’s I found a newspaper which gave accounts of the most dreadful sufferings in Ireland for want of bread and also a mortal fever which they think is brought on them on account of being so grievously pinched with hunger and they say very many thousands are now in a most grievous suffering condition for want of food and no way to procure any for themselves but to depend on the charity and kindness of their fellow creatures it is said there is vast sums of money raised for their relief and great exertion yet very many most grievously suffer and that many die and perish with hunger they tell me that almost every newspaper gives some accounts of the sufferings in Ireland but I see but very few of them it seems as if it must be the most dreadful suffering time I ever heard of in my time.
23. This afternoon I was reading <italic>Piety Promoted</italic> by Thomas Wagstaff page 147, concerning Thomas Ross: Last words he was a native of Ireland but came into America when young and lived here until near his end then went to visit England, Ireland and Scotland and died there in Europe in his travels. See here some of his last words, Oh, the vileness of the land of Ireland surely if any nation ever had occasion to mourn because of oaths that has and now a most mournful miserable suffering time it is in that nation on account of scarcity of bread and fear obedience and care. Thomas Ross was a worthy acceptable minister. I have been in his company divers times and remember well his words he [entry ends]

25 of the Eighth Month, 1822, First Day. At our meeting which was large it is become a great practice with the people of the city to come up into the country at this season of the year and many were there some Presbyterians it is said might be distinguished by their dress and perhaps some of other sects and I did pity them for it was a very poor dull dry time forepart Nathan Smith after a while spoke largely and lively as ever he did I thought but it seemed to me to be such a low time that there seemed no ability to impart my thoughts nor a state fit to hear or receive. I did mention something of two sorts of religion, one of which will do very well in fair weather but will not do in a storm but it is evident there is a religion that can support and uphold in the greatest storms and times of trial against which the gates of Hell could never prevail and the time will overtake us when we shall stand in need of such a religion and none knows how soon and we may if we choose to take the council of the Divine Master be favored with such a religion that will do in a storm for he says whosoever heareth these sayings of min and doeth them I should be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock and when the storm beat upon it fell not because it was landed upon a rock but they that heard his saying and did them not should be likened to a foolish man that built his house upon the land and when the storm beat upon it it fell and great was the fall <note resp="transcr">Matthew 7:24-27</note>   thereof from accounts we have no room to scruple it is a stormy time with many both by sea and land famine and pestilence has much prevailed in divers places very many thousand are pining away with hunger and are stricken through for want of the fruits of the field and had great need of such a religion as the prophet had when he said although the fields should yield no meat yet will I rejoice in the Lord and rejoice in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>   or such a religion as Job had see 5 of Job 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 at destruction and famine those that laugh, etc., etc., but I was so poor I was ready to wish I had kept quite silent although I thought the meeting ended a little better but I thought it was a shame for us who make such a high profession to be so poor and destitute of a right clothing.
[marginal note] He, that is, Thomas Ross, once told me he believed I would be put upon business and spoke lovingly and encouraging divers times to me.

29 of the 8th Month, 1822. Fifth Day. At our meeting small and quite all shut up in silence of the poorest sort some of us thought we seldom ever seen a poorer meeting after such abundant labor from east and west, north and south and from beyond the seas.
31. Was select meeting. Oh the want of life everhere and everywhere although from accounts we have no room to scruple. It is a trying time with many far and near. Sword, pestilence, and famine in divers places and very awful accounts near here of sudden deaths and strange disorders and divers in the midst of their days suddenly snatched away with very short sickness and some much out of their senses with such disorders that people were afraid was very infectious so that they were afraid to lay out the corpse or attend the burials of some it is said the Yellow Fever is very mortal in New York it is said that few if any recover that are taken with it and instances is reported where whole families are taken away but is difficult to know what to believe reports differ so much but there is room to fear there is too much truth in the reports.
See a little book called A Short and Easy Method of Prayer by Lady Guion, page 73: to serve God is to reign (then what is it to serve Satan) the end for which we were created is to enjoy God even in this life: yet alas this is the least in the thoughts of most men: so says Thomas Finch too few are under much concern and care about the souls yet Barclay says the service of Christ is perfect freed [freedom?] and [indecipherable] if so what is the service of Satan perfect bondage and slavery - page 47. Two sorts of persons are silent the one because they have nothing to say and the other because they have too much the case is the same in this degree of prayer we speak of: they are silent not for want but through fullness and excess.

First Day: 1st of the Ninth Month. At our meeting I believe there was some stirrings of life and evident tokens or marks of the work of a right spirit: I thought I was helped beyond all expectation to good satisfaction E.R. had a good deal to say and I thought it end reputably and savory.

5 of the Ninth Month, 1822. At our Monthly Meeting Amos Hilburn of Berry was there his son passed meeting with one Smith – the meeting forepart much shut up the latter meeting middling not fully to my satisfaction though not much cause of complaint. Benajah Butcher’s son of Mount Holly passed with A. Robert’s daughter of William Roberts.
8 was First Day. At our meeting not the very poorest nor a very full tide as at some other times: fullness of bread and abundance of idleness: to dig too idle and to beg too proud yet under name of stewards feign would shroud <note resp="transcr">Luke 16:3</note>  : a friend of Philadelphia tells me they hear it is a very awful time at New York the Yellow Fever is very much prevalent and mortal and we hear of a great deal of sickness all about our neighborhood and country fevers. Seven in one family the doctor says so ill they cannot sit up and twenty dangerously ill in a small distance. 
11 of the Ninth Month. A neighbor handed me a newspaper dated 3rd of this month. The calamities of the Irish have no way abated. Hundreds were dying daily of want and the hospitals were filled with the sick. July 8th: by the account received there is no alleviations of the diseases prevalent in Ireland the famine and fever prevails very greatly 155,000 persons were and are now receiving charitable relief: It appears that there are 3000 of the population of those parishes in great distress in consequence of want of money or means to procure subsistence a man and his wife they believe died of starvation and others must if relief and sustenance is not speedily procured for their relief that the fever is spreading to an alarming extent and those who are afflicted with the disease are in the most deplorable state of poverty. Two hundred thousand pounds sterling were voted in the House of Commons on the 23 of July for the relief of the dismissed in Ireland they say: The subscription at the London tavern for the relief of the poor in Ireland had reached the sum of near three hundred thousand pounds sterling: It is reported in the news that twenty thousand have left the City of New York on account of the prevalence of the Yellow Fever: and some say forty thousand there seems no room to scruple but the calamity is very great in New York and in Ireland both.

See Lamentations 1 and 9: verse her filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her last end. Therefore she came down wonderfully she had no comforter. What a wonderful coming down there has been many and many a time amongst the people when according to Scripture accounts the judgments of the Lord have been sent upon them the sword the pestilence the famine and noisome beast storms of hail and great earthquakes wherein many thousands have perished in a few minutes and whole great cities sank. We hear of these sore judgments on the people of Ireland and New York and many other places but yet how little do we think what a coming down there would be amongst us if the Lord should turn his hand upon us and send some of these sore judgments amongst us how would our shining painted carriages, gilded harness shining like silver, and nice, matched, fine, fat horses looks when we were so starved and hungry as to wish to eat a piece of the fine horses. He adds as it is said they have been known to boil old leather, the harness of their horses; yea, we read in Scripture that the hands of the pitiful women had sodden their own children <note resp="transcr">Lamentations 4:10</note>   this is wonderful coming down indeed. Read the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the 28 Chapter of Deuteronomy there we may see the blessed fruits and effects of obedience and the dreadful consequence of disobedience and what the disobedient are to expect. That eminent dignified servant of Lord Humphrey Smith who died in prison said near his end it is a fine thing for a man to have the Lord for his friend at such a times as this a fine thing – indeed and the finest of all fine things that can make all our bed in our sickness and strengthen us upon the bed of languishing and prepare them to say although I walk through

through the valley of the shadow of death yet will I fear no evil <note resp="transcr">Psalm 23:4</note>   although the fields shall yield no meat yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17</note>   and see Job 5 and 19: He shall deliver them six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee 20 in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword. 21: Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 22: At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; etc., etc., a fine thing indeed to have such a religion that brings people into the favor of such a friend that can and has done such great things for his faithful obedient children and people as we read he did for Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: Job, David, Daniel, Shadreck, Mescheck and Abednego and as we read in the 11 of Hebrews he quenched the violence of fire, stopped the mouths of lions. Out of weakness they were made strong and put the armies of the aliens to flight: a fine thing indeed to have such a religion and such a friend: and oh how many thousand at this very hour do greatly want such a religion and such a friend now they are pining away with hunger and are stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. Read now the 91st Psalm, particularly verse 4 and 5: He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler, thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day. 6: Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that walketh at noon day. 7: A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee. 8: Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked such a religion is worth having what wisdom it would be in all above all things to endeavor to make the Lord their friend. If ye do whatsoever I command you then are ye my friends <note resp="transcr">John 15:14</note>   If the people in Ireland and the people of New York now under their grievous sufferings of famine and pestilence were favored to have the Lord for their friend oh how far it would tranced all the joys and pleasures, riches and treasures this world can afford and we read that formerly when under their great affliction they sought the Lord he was found of them <note resp="transcr">2 Chronicles 15:4</note>   when the judgments of the Lord are in the earth they will learn righteousness.

11th of the Ninth Month, 1822. My daughter Abigail and I went to select meeting at Haddonfield all shut up in silence, dullness, leanness poverty, and lowness I counted it a mercy to be enabled to keep to the travail and exercise in answering our queries. Poor, old fashioned, dry formal, dull work and yet as I was favored to keep single I came off with good satisfaction and approbation of my friends we went to dine with Joseph Collins whose wife is Ann Edwards sister and their sister Elizabeth lives with them and our cousin Henry Warrington and his mother-in-law Lidia Lippincott came there and at parting we had a sitting with them to the satisfaction of all I believe.
12. We went to quarterly meeting a wagon full six of us two children and two grandchildren. The meeting was very large and it is likely many were disappointed for we had but little preaching waters seemed low there were a number of valuable ministers and in the meeting for business answering queries there were many pertinent, lively remarks on the state of society and things amongst us. I expressed some concern I had on account of the growing increasing custom of reading the news and the customary unnecessary unbecoming use of tobacco. The most enormous expense our country was at to furnish themselves with these two articles: the thousands and tens of hundreds of thousands if not millions of money which if applied to the use of the poor would help many a worthy person in distress and would be an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord. I expect I exposed myself to the scorn and contempt of many although I have no doubt there is a witness placed in every heart that testifies there is a great excess and danger in them things although so little noticed which would not be pleasant to remember in a time of trouble such as they at this time experience at New York and in Ireland where they are raising money by thousands to keep the poor from starving and they say many perish for want. Our first Friends William Edmondson and William Penn bore a zealous testimony against the customary unbecoming use of tobacco to see even boys and girls smoking segars many hurting their health I am informed that the expense in segars one year in the City of New York only was 20 thousand dollars I had peace.

15th of the Ninth Month, 1822. First Day. At our meeting if it deserved the name of a meeting it was pretty near full, but oh, the manner in which people come – the trifling indifferency, the unconcernedness, the lukewarmness. Richard Davies says it was their concern in all their meetings together to feel the Lord among them and he did manifest himself among them at times in a distinguished manner to the contriting their hearts even to tears so that at some of their meetings there was scarcely a dry eye amongst them although altogether silent and they could say the Lord alone was master of their assembly and they used to say when friends minds were more disencumbered with the cares of this world the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost was more frequently felt amongst them but alas what do we experience of these things would it not be strange talk do we even understand such language: I have heard tell of the garment of praise – instead of the spirit of heaviness <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 61:3</note>   but I thought we had the spirit of heavyness instead of the garment of praise I thought I seldom ever seen a duller, poorer time and all shut up till at last E.R. said considerable and it seemed to end a little better but I was unwell and hardly able to wrestle or labor for the arisings of life which it seems very few so much as ever think of or understand the language so no wonder poverty abounds: Last Sixth Day, the 13th, there were 3 burials at Haddonfield: Bulah Clement near 90 years of age my old acquaintance and one stout healthy man In the midst of his days with very short illness. We hear of great sickness at Salem and Woodbury and many deaths and we hear of pinching drought in Bucks County and Chester County fields of corn they say many will yield next to nothing: it has been so dry and hot here that the Indian corn is fit to husk and many are at it I believe the man is not living that ever seen the like it has been very hot weather ill now 18 of the Ninth Month it changed very cool this night a pretty smart frost for the first this fall Job Scott in his journal mentions a frost in the Eighth Month which he seem to thing – something alarming but some remarked there was frost almost every month through the summer a few years ago however I know we used sometimes to have the corn killed with the frost before it was ripe. But now it is almost all dry.
[marginal note] A great show for rain though we had but little here it was a heavy rain up the river and in Pennsylvania a few days ago.

19 of the Ninth Month, Fifth Day. At our meeting more stirrings of life and evident ownings of truth than I have seen of late some satisfaction although waters are very low great dullness and indifferency although the calls are loud for and near sickness and mortality in many places far and near this morning 
22 of the Ninth Month, 1822. I received a letter from Abraham Warrington of the state of Ohio giving an account of the dysentery in more or less in most places and many deaths amongst them and some blooming youth taken off with it.
22. First Day. At our meeting and a lively open owning time it seem to be it held near half an hour longer than common and the people did not seem impatient there was a comfortable covering and feeling nearness at parting.
26. Our preparative meeting. But so so middling some temporal concerns came before us and o how wise how capable we are fit for agents in worldly concerns but dumb and dull enough about spiritual
29. First Day. At our meeting where there is few to work it brings the labor hard on a few (I cannot dig and to beg I am ashamed was the language formerly <note resp="transcr">Luke 16:3</note>  ) to dig too idle and to beg too proud yet under name of stewards feign would shroud we sat in poverty all shut up till late and I ventured to stand up and as I was favored to beg for help it was I thought an evident owning time then E. Roberts and A.H. so the meeting held half an hour or more longer than common and there was something that kept them from grumbling as they used sometimes to do when meeting held but a little longer than common a satisfactory time to me in a good degree.
{1822-10}
3 of the Tenth Month. At our meeting. Smaller than common a very busy time getting in fall crops and seeding, etc. but the smallness was I thought not the worst of it. A spirit of heaviness instead of the garment of praise <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 61:3</note>   I can hardly bear such indolence, indifferency, and dry formality with patience I thought of what William Hunt told the people once at a meeting you look to me to be a lazy idle pack.
6th of the Tenth Month, 1822. First Day. We were invited to the burial of John Haines of Cropwell, an elder, an exemplary, steady, innocent man of an unblemished character near sixty years of age left a widow and a large family of children and several grandchildren there was a large number of people and behaved very still and orderly he lived near Cropwell meeting house and they got early to meeting Hinchman Haines myself and Elizabeth Barton had considerable to say but it seemed hard getting along dullness and dryness prevails although so many calls after divers ways and divers manners.

My children brought home a little book from burying from H. Lippincott called <italic>Piety Promoted</italic> giving an excellent account of the blessed and happy end of many faithful friends and some children of eight and nine years old and of the blessed happy end they were favored to make. Is it not as William Hunt said at last a wonder all the world does not seek after peace of mind it is such an excellent treasure at last what says he would all the world do for me now if I was destitute of this peace and this was the substance of the last words of many of the faithful.
4 of the Tenth Month. I was reading that precious sweet little book, see page 195, concerning Richard Rensom some of his last words when a friend bid him farewell he said in a weighty manner fare well fare well in the Lord Jesus for in him alone it is we can fare well and we may remember what he (the Divine Master) has said in this world the shall have tribulation but in me peace <note resp="transcr">John 16:33</note>   in thy presence said David is fullness of joy <note resp="transcr">Psalm 16:11</note>   but is fullness of joy to be found and enjoyed without it: and again he says the Lord’s loving kindness is better than life <note resp="transcr">Psalm 63:3</note>   we may see that people are in a blessed happy state when favored of the Lord who delivered Jonah and Joseph out of their deepest distress and many others of the faithful but oh, to think of the dismal state of those who have forsaken the Lord and cast of the thing that is good how we may see how the enemy has pursued them and how they who have pursued lying vanities have forsaken their own mercies: weather continues very warm like summer the horses sweat like midsummer going to meeting I believe that the man is not living that can say they ever seen so little frost cold storm of high winds.
13 of the Tenth Month. First Day. My daughters went with me to Easton meeting which was very small and very poor as to the life of truth but yet there seems to be some growth and a living remnant like a little seed I found it hard getting along not much satisfaction nor did repent being there we dined at Joseph Haines a lively young minister had a sitting at parting and got well home though weary.
16. Fifth Day. At our meeting Benejah Butcher and Abigail Roberts were married there was a pretty many people and I thought it appeared they had generally chosen their own ways and thought there was little or none of the Lord’s ways with us there are four of us that frequently have something to say in our meetings but all quite shut up and as poor and destitute of the savor of life and ownings of truth as those who trouble themselves not at all about any religion of any sort not clothing enough to hide our nakedness but to see the parade with their fine carriages we might say with the prophet there is no end to their chariots <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:7</note>  : jumping carriots [chariots?]: although but poor in circumstance.

See Stephen Crisp's <italic>Sermons</italic>, page 256, for so long as men or women stand in unity with their lusts and – concupiscence with the spirit of this world and the way of it they are not capable of receiving that which should lead them in the way of Holiness; nay, if it appears to them they cannot receive it for it is with them as with other guest there be other lovers already let in which employ the powers and faculties of their souls: so that it is no wonder we have such poor dull meetings especially at weddings where there seems no room for thirst and his disciples for their very appearance demonstrate the desire not the knowledge of his humble narrow way I thought they had forsaken the fountain of living waters and hewn to themselves cisterns that can hold no water <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:13</note>   so we are dry, poor, and barren the apostle says the friendship of this world and a carnal mind is enmity with God <note resp="transcr">Romans 8:7</note>   what will be the consequence after so much labor bestowed upon us they that pursue lying vanities forsake their own mercies <note resp="transcr">Jonah 2:8</note>   and they that cast of thing that is good the enemy shall pursue them <note resp="transcr">Hosea 8:3</note>   this day a lameness in my knee which I have felt something of some years ago has increased until I can hardly walk across the house or bear my weight on it I know not what it is without it is the rheumatism it is not attended with much pain yet if I keep still I was hard beset to get in the house when I got from meeting my son Joseph and his wife are now with us from Fallowfield – in Pennsylvania and he informs me that the dysentery has been so mortal near them that four and five have died out of one house and two corpses carried out of one house at one time but now abated yet it seems to have no effect or check on the pride and high-mindedness of our youth or others we used to have it in our queries are friends careful to keep to moderation on account of births, marriages, burials, and all other occasions but it is really a question whether they are not now the farthest from moderation on account of these things of any people If there are any before us we certainly are stretching hard after them: there were about 10 or 12 chairs in a train to carry the wedding guest and I suppose it is true that it is become a fashion with our young people nowadays at weddings their guest must all ride in chairs or shais [chaises?] I once seen about 12 or 14 coaches in a range in the street and they told me they were attending the burial of a young man who died suddenly many worthy Friends have been concerned to see the great parade amongst us at burials Samuel Smith and others left a charge not to give any public invitations to their burials and divers others our first Friends wrote long epistles and called them epistles against pride and often had this saying in them surely will not the Lord visit for these things.

Happiness consists in being prepared to enjoy possessions not in having them see Jeremiah 6 and 10 the world of the Lord is unto them a reproach they have no delight in it: verse 13 far from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness: can we clear ourselves of such a charge as this in our days.
20 of the Tenth Month, 1822. First Day I am so lame with a pain in my knee I can hardly get from the bed to the fire: I happened to take up Hoyland's Works 1st volume, page 277. He says of religion which is the joy the guide the supporter of the universe. Page 280: For extraordinary things frequently repeated are extraordinary no longer and consequently soon lose their force is this the reason why in these days line upon line and precept upon precept have so little effect or what is it. Page 281: The man who fears God is raised above all other fear in the confidence of faith: it appears to be so in the case of Daniel, Shadreck and Abednego. Page 282: Unless the mind be under the regulating power of religion it will be perpetually losing its balance and changing its temper in substance he says some times too fast and some times too slow some times too high and some times too low in spirit. Page 285: But we need not recur to distant periods of history for an example of ruin our effects produced by inattention to religious principles the history of every man’s own experience is illustration sufficient: but see the stability of the righteous see last part of the 5 of Job thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh so indeed it appears to have been with Daniel, Shadreck, Mashick and Abednego and all the faithful martyrs and our worthy progenitors they could not afright them with their utmost stretch of power to punish with prison nor dungeon, stake, gallows, whipping, or banish men and all their envy and malice could invent page 283 he says of little consequence is it to obtain the possession of expected good unless we are fitted for the enjoyment of it: this makes me think of some of our youth ho after their parents have been at great expense in schooling their children they bring forth sour grapes and what can fit children for the enjoyment of good but as John Churchman says prepare their minds to receive the power of truth without which he says they never can be happy page 284 he says there can be no good government but what is found upon religion: page 292 Happiness consists not in having possessions but in being fitted to enjoy them how have we seen the truth of this saying verified in very many instances where young people have had very great estates put into their hands they have lived very unhappy for want of being fitted to enjoy them and their minds prepared to receive the power of truth without which earthly possessions cannot make them happy: 20 First day I so lame could not go to meeting weather warm like midsummer. Quite oppressive sweaty.

23rd of the Tenth Month. I hear that South Carolina has lately been visited with a most tremendous storm the like seldom ever heard of in our days many lives lost and houses torn down, roads stopped up very much and their roads stopped up in a terrible manner. I am told that one Hemingway was lately coming from Salem, Ohio says on the road she asked for water and they told her they had none she moved from Evesham not many years ago Abraham Warrington living at Ohio informs me that the drovers of cattle was forced to turn back on account of the scarcity of water and that and about Fallowfield forty or fifty miles west of Philadelphia their wells and springs were so dried up that they were sinking them in them parts that at West Chester they sold water 11 penny bit a barrel and that they carried water about to sell by the small quantity.
See Lamentations 5 chapter and 4 we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto us read the chapter I never heard the like before here.
25. I received a letter from Redstone it informs they have had no rain to wet the ground since the 1st of the Fifth Month corn about half a crop oats and grass very short the dryest summer known since settled.
28. First Day. I am so lame I cannot move without crutches so confined see Hoyland’s works first volume page 383 Moses had a very perverse and wicked generation committed to his charge or care: he did his utmost to make the people obedient and to save them from ruin but in vain: in thy space of fourty years they all fell in the wilderness except two: Christ also was given to a generation not less wicked and pervers: his instructions were lost upon them and in about the same space after they had rejected him they were destroyed Noah I think we read was a preacher of righteousness an hundred years before the flood <note resp="transcr">2 Peter 2:5</note>   and yet they went on in wickedness until it is said all flesh had corrupted their way and the imaginations of their hearts was only evil continually and the flood came and swept them all away but Noah and his family were saved in the ark.
6 of the Tenth Month. First Day. We were at the burial of John Haines of Cropwell.

3 of the Eleventh Month, 1822. First Day. Although I am so lame with a weakness and stiffness in my knee I can hardly bear my weight upon it or go at all without crutches. I did get to our meeting and had no cause to repent it. I believe there was something of the ownings of truth and savor of life it was an open owning time to sweet satisfaction divers short lively pertinent savor testimonies several there from neighbouring meetings and my wife thinks it ended savory and reputably which we think some of latter time hardly did: they were so poor and destitute of life.
7th. Was our Monthly Meeting although it was rainy and not much better of my lameness I got to meeting and had no cause to repent it something owning open and savory although in the last sitting there were some very clost remarks on the deviation prevailing amongst us on looking over the day I could not recollect any thing that was said that I could wish had not been said: had something of that precious cement at last unity, sweetness, and feeling nearness.
4. Abigail and I went to see our neighbor John Haines and wife who seem to be improving a little in religion just after we got there five of our friends came to pay them a visit and had a sitting and several spoke and broke up abruptly and I came away not satisfied this visit was in compliance of the advice of the Yearly Meeting: but to little purpose that I could see or feel our last Yearly Meeting appeared to be under a great concern for a reformation amongst us and great need there is they appointed a large committee to visit the quarterly and  monthly meetings and when they were with us I thought they found hard, dull work and in some places very much shut up and they say they found the state of some meetings very poor and low. It is a great thing to undertake to persuade people to change their customs and alter for the better custom is a tyrant he that can well bear or breat it is more than man our association of Evesham lately laboring to discourage the use of spirituous liquors drew up a very excellent paper of advice and caution on that subject and ordered it to be set up at the taverns as one was sitting some of them up at a tavern the landlady or tavern keeper's wife said you may set them up all round the house but it will do no more good than singing psalms to a dead horse but pay day must come what a pity it is that all are no concerned like John Gratton was: see his journal page 74 I wanted the Lord’s presence for without that my poor soul could not be satisfied nor find true rest though my life and conversation were such that most loved me that knew me are not some as innocent as a sheep and yet content without feeling the Lord’s presence.

10th of the Eleventh Month, 1822. First Day. My knee continues very lame cannot bear my weight on it. If I keep it still and warm it is pretty easy, except at times which is a favor I did not get out with our folks to meeting. Cloudy, dull weather.
11. Second Day. A stranger, Isaac Hammer, [from] Tennesse country six hundred miles southwest. Isaac Hammer appointed a meeting at Moorestown a pretty many came it’s likely principally to hear what the stranger had to say and were disappointed for he had nothing to say and a poorer meeting as to the stirrings of life and ownings of truth I seldom seen if people come to meet only for what they can hear with their outward ears is it any matter if they are disappointed: poor scholars indeed if they have got no further and it is to be feared it is really the case people should go to meeting more for what they need to feel than what they may see or hear: feel after him if happily ye may find him: in all our meetings together it was our concern to feel the Lord amongst us: according to his promise of being with two or three gathered in his name said Richard Davies: very come yet.
This stranger informed me of our cousin Margaret Minthel a worthy minister in the Genesse country, a daughter of our dear worthy kinsman William Hunt’s. They say most of his large family of children follow him in the line of the ministry. I have had ten children, three died very young, two died about the twenty-fifth year of their age hopeful five are living yet and I never knew one of them accused of lying swearing fraudulent dealing – unchastity or drunkenness and mostly willing to keep to plainness in their dress and punctuality yet great room for improvement but a great mercy they have escaped the spots and stains of this world so far: true and undefiled religion is to keep ourselves unspotted from the world:

8 of the 11th month, 1822. I had a little book sent to me to read the account of Archibald Robbins his being shipwrecked and taken among the Arabians where he suffered about two years the most cruel slavery by that Indian like barbarous, heathenish, idolatrous, Meksmits people but at last found one man very rich and very kind he says to know the manner in which he spends much of his immense income would be to learn that with him wealth is devoted to the noblest of all purposes diminishing human woe and augmenting human happiness he has by his munificience secured the favor even of the Mehommedans [Muslims]: with all their antipathy against Christians: how seldom is riches applied to his greatest and most noblest of purposes page 251 – in the same book page 236 giving an account of that barbarous, idolatrous, heathenish peoples: customs and manners of that place (Santa Cruz) and of the tropics and markets says one article however which is a principal one at that place is never seen among the shilluh – tobacco: this being considered by them or among them as a detestable weed and the use of it as a transgression: does not this provoke us to jealousy who are high professing Christians by them who are professed Mehommedans [Muslims] and great enemies and haters of Christians and greatly despise them. Noah was a preacher of righteousness and what become of his people people the flood destroyed them all but Noah and his family. Moses was called prophet and most deeply concerned for his people after all his care and labor and the many miracles they all felt in the wilderness but 2 Caleb and Joshua Christ also was given to a to a generation not less wicked, perverse and his instruction were lost upon them and in about the same space after they had rejected him they were destroyed says Hoyland how are many of us infatuated, besotted, and bewitched with the customary use of tobacco: high professing Christians. <note resp="transcr">Archibald Robbins, A<italic> Journal Comprising an Account of the Loss of the Brig Commerce, </italic>several editions published prior to this date.</note>

27th of the 11th month, 1822. I have been very lame with a pain and weakness in one of my knees this several weeks so that I have been forced to keep still and have been to meeting but little. Last First Day, 24 of the Eleventh Month First Day was at our meeting and had something to remark on the uncertainty of time and the happiness of them who in time wisely prepare for it and how many are suddenly taken away and three days after my dear dutiful, affectionate innocent son Benjamin was suddenly killed digging of marl. He had been at work at it with four or five hands about ten days and that day was to finish the job but this 27 of the Eleventh Month, 1822, about one o’clock, the bank caved in and covered up one of the men, all but his head and nose and whilst they were digging him out the earth caved in the second time and some ironstone being throwed up on the bank fell in and struck our dear son on the breast and covered him up to the knees. They quickly got him dug loose but he told them he was so hurt he could not live. They carried him to a house near half a mile [and] sent for a doctor. One got there very soon after he was hurt and the second in a short time but his wound was so deep they could do nothing for him and he lived hard four hours after he was hurt. They sent for his wife but he was gone before she got there they tell us he had a great deal to say raised his voice and desired them about him not to put of making preparation for such a time as that was with him and advised his little son William 11 years old to be a good boy said he was concerned for his children and not only for his own but for all the world over and told them his peace was made and had a hope of future happiness. It was believed bleeding inwardly suffocated him and took him of and that might be the reason why he appeared not to be in great misery and pain. 29 on Sixth Day we went to the burial of our dear innocent son and a solemn time it was a house of mourning indeed six children and all small but one and a very weakly helpless mother: people seemed affected.
<pb id="A0011534_043"/>
In memory of my dear son Benjamin Hunt who was just about forty two years of age when he died: He was a pretty little innocent goodly child from his infancy remarkably beloved by all his little brothers and sisters and all along as he grew up: he seemed to be beloved by all that knew him or had anything to do with him. His servant a coloured lad said he could live with Benne forever. A poor old widow who lived with him as an hired servant said she had lost a good friend. He was industrious enough, ingenious, gifted and very capable of managing his temporal affairs. He had a good share of natural understanding gifts and talents and seemed disposed to improve and make a right use of them he was very constant and diligent in tending all our religious meetings and very exemplary in quiet steady setting in our meetings for worship in the time of silence and sometimes spoke to the business in meetings for discipline which was acceptable to his Friends. His troubles and trials were many and very great which he bore with great fortitude and exemplary patience. Now he is gone we believe out of the reach of trouble where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest: where none of the inhabitants ever shall say I am sick: made his escape, as David says, from the windy – storm and tempest  <note resp="transcr">Psalm 55:8</note> : for such this world is to very many. As he had lived, so he died, beloved and lamented by his friends and neighbors, few leavening a more unblemished character: which seems now to be a very great advantage to his poor children for it is wonderful to see the open heartedness and kindness of his friends in a care and concern to take care of his dear little children: for whom he expressed such a concern in his last moments and a very great comfort to see a prospect of the children being like to get such good places with their relations where they seem like to be kindly cared for both temporally and spiritually.
It is a grievous thing when some shorten their days with intemperance and leave poor families of children a burden on their friends as some do and nothing but a grief to their friends from their cradles.

1st of the Twelfth Month, 1822. First Day. I ventured out to our meeting. Had a painful night again. Sarah Cresson was there and I recon she preached near two hours and a solemnity and heavenly sweetness attended the meeting but alas what will it do for people if they sit down content with barely hearing tell of good things without laboring to possess them for themselves will it not be like Ephraim feeding on the wind <note resp="transcr">Ephraim 12:1</note>   if they do not labor to have something of their own bread in their own houses and water in their own cisterns. Without this concern and labor George Fox says people may perish for want.  We have line upon line, precept upon precept upon precept not only here a little and there a little but here a great deal and there is a great deal which we acknowledge to be very good but what has it done for us where much is given much will be required woe unto the Corasin woe unto the Bethsaida if the great and mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long: ago in sackcloth and ashes <note resp="transcr">Luke 10:13</note>  : Noah was a preacher of righteousness, Moses was a prophet and see what became of the people that they preached to Noah’s people all perished in the flood Moses’s people all fell in the wilderness but Caleb and Joshua and the people to whom Christ was given were no less perverse and wicked and his instruction were lost upon them and in about the same space of time after they had rejected him they were destroyed: says Hoyland: so see here is the effects and fruits of people sitting down contented with barely hearing tell of good things without laboring to possess them for themselves.
As I lay thinking of the sudden death of our dear son Benjamin it came fresh into remembrance how many times I seemed to narrowly escape being suddenly killed by accidents and how many are or have been very suddenly snatched away without a moment’s warning as it were and very many by sickness with very short – warning: so that happy indeed are they that wisely prepare for it and as I had to mentions last First Day was a week the last meeting I and my dear son sat together in meeting: I said I had of ten thoughts what a fine thing it would be if I could be one of the number of the righteous then if I should be suddenly snatched away without a moment’s warning as many are yet all would be well. Oh,  how little did he or I think it would so soon be his lot to be so soon and so suddenly snatched away: yet it seems to be generally believed all is well with him: for that transcends all this world can afford when we consider the length of eternity.

3rd of the Twelfth Month, 1822, and Third of the week some say there has scarcely been a fall more moderate grass looks more fresh and green and growing even till now in the yard than it did in the dry weather in summer there has been abundance of rain of late First Day Morning the day before yesterday there was a great deal of thunder and lightning and had been a great rain in the night Now this Second Day night and Third Day morning a considerable snow storm although not very cold nor windy I could but take notice of the sudden change in the weather and how very changeable the things of this world are none knows what a day or an hour yea or a minute may bring forth – as one day goes another comes? and sometimes shews us dismal dooms? Now and then: a pleasant day? Long a coming soon away: wherefore the everlasting truth? is good for aged and for youth: for them to set their hearts upon? for that will last till time is done? see Thomas Chalkley’s journal: words he has preserved of his son 10 years old: a very cold freezing time after it cleared up very winter like weather 8 of the Twelfth Month First Day weather clears up fine and moderate and my lame knee a little better I got out to meeting again and had no cause to repent being there on the whole at last there was something owning savory and satisfactory Ann Quicksil of Evesham had savory service my friends seemed glad to see me again and there was something of that precious cement of sweetness and feeling nearness at parting.
12 was our quarterly meeting at Evesham and very large there was a many aimiable, able ministers Richard Jordan John Cox and divers others but Daniel Pucket from Indiana about 900 miles westward had a great deal to say, took up most of the time in the first meeting and a good deal in the last. He is a very great and able minister and it is said he was in army amongst the soldiers last war I had but one or two shots and to right good satisfaction my friends seemed to on me sweetness and feeling nearness at parting: which I count a great favor.
15. Went to an afternoon meeting at 3 o’clock at Evesham for the youth. Daniel Pucket preached till it began to grow dark and the people kept very still and attentive: 3000 we read was converted at Peter’s first sermon but nowadays there appears but little impression.
<pb id="A0011534_046"/>
17th of the 12 month. Third of the week. Daniel Pucket appointed a meeting at Moorestown, and I believe it held about one hour longer than common, and he preached most of the time. [There were] many there who were like the dispersed of Judah and scattered of Israel <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 11:12</note>  , for whom I have always had my mind much turned, but I had not time to relieve my mind towards them, but I hope what they heard may be as bread cast upon the waters, and found after many days. But a few weeks ago, Isaac Hammer from Tennessee Countery, 600 miles or more from the south west appointed a meeting at Moorestown, but had nothing to say or at least said nothing, and I am informed he was silent at several other neighbouring meetings although he is an able minister, as they profess to be led by an unerring spirit, these things may seem strange to many but the prophet speaking in the name of the Lord said, your ways are not my ways nor your thoughts my thoughts as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 55:8-9</note>   much cloudy weather and rain but holds fine and warm.
22. Was First Day I got out to our meeting again to good satisfaction I now hear that a Negro lad who served his time with our dear son Benjamin and said he could live with him forever: is dead although it is but a few weeks since he was here at work with us stout healthy and strong and we hear of a number of very sudden deaths round about us and in Philadelphia we are told many have died very suddenly of latter time: a remarkable number.
27. We went to the burial of Abigail Thorn, some older than myself, has been a healthy woman through life lived in fullness and prosperity and escaped the pollutions of the world. I do not remember I ever heard anything said against her. There was a large concourse of people and behaved solid and very orderly. I had something to say and I believe helped to good satisfaction.

The ground that drinketh in the rain and bringeth forth briers and thorns is nigh unto cursing says the Scriptures <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 6:7-8</note>  .
I have been of late much confined to the house. Cannot bear the cold, it effects my old asthma cough, but my knee is better so that I can walk without crutches. Weather moderate.
{1823-01}
9th of the 1st [month], 1823, was our Monthly Meeting. Elias Hicks of the state of New York was there. He is by some, if not many, counted the greatest minister in America. I scarcely ever seen our meeting House more fully crowded, and he preached one hour or more, very sound pertinent doctrine, and the people were very attentive, but alas, what does it do for us, all the abundance of preaching we have had of latter time. Our first Friends say that in early days, when the people’s minds were more disengaged from the world, the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost was more frequently and evidently felt amongst them to the tendering their hearts and coveting their spirits even to tears and trembling – but it is to be feared his humble tender contrite state is too little known in these days: If there was a disposition not only to hear and enquire after the right way of the Lord and a desire to walk in it there would be room for hope: but whilst people are determined to walk in their own ways like the gentiles: we will eat our own meat and wear our own apparel, etc. <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 4:1</note>  . It is as Stephen Crisp says; see his <italic>Sermons</italic>, page 256: For so long as men and women stand in unity with their lusts and concupiscence with the spirit of this world and the way of it, they are not capable of receiving that which should lead them into the way of Holiness. Nay, if it appears to them they cannot receive it: for it is with them as with other guests. There are other lovers already let in which employ the powers and faculties of their souls. So these celestial showers are like pouring water upon a rock: all runs off without making any impressions, and but little fruit of all the abundance of labor bestowed upon us our first Friends say many were convinced at their meetings, and we read that 3000 were converted at Peter’s first sermon and as many as made 5000 at the next. I thought the meeting for discipline was pretty well conducted and the stranger had a good deal to say and it was satisfactory to me. I thought I saw the states of the people and what they stood in need of.
<pb id="A0011534_048"/>
See here some words of William Penn: Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled: it is the full soul that loathes the honeycomb. Those who are overcharged with the world and the things of the world they are of an ill constitution: they are so filled with the world that they cannot hunger and thirst after righteousness. The Lord fills the hungry with good things but they that are rich and full and think they want nothing, he sends empty away. Charron says to be cloyed is to lose all: it appears a full fed cloyed state was a very loathsome state to the children of Israel. As N.W. said, too much pudding would choke a dog.
12. First Day. Daniel Pucket and Priscilla Hunt, both of Indiana, were there. Daniel had an open, owning, favored time. The House nearly full up, stairs and down, and something solemn and savory. Margaret Allison and a young minister from Holly took up some of the time and Daniel stood up the second time and we thought he was favored and the meeting ended reputably savory and well he is a very great preacher and there might be some good done but the tenderness and contrition was but little to what it has been in some meetings the ointment of his right hand betrayeth its self <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:16</note>  . As Robert Walker said, people love to hear preaching but they do not love the cross. Little will hearing tell of the right way of the Lord do for people whilst people are determined to walk in their own ways to eat their own meat and wear their own apparel <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 4:1 </note>  , etc. This appears to be the very cause or reason why the abundance of preaching has so little effect. <italic>No Cross No Crown</italic>: hear and obey and your souls shall live. Margaret Allinson and her sister Elizabeth and their friend Rowland Jones of Burlington (all of them) paid us a pretty acceptable visit this evening.
16. Fifth Day. Priscilla Hunt, a daughter in law of our cousin Nathan Hunt, came to see us with her companions. And we went with them to Cropwell meeting, where she had extensive, acceptable service. She is a young widow from Indiana, 800 miles or more westward. She appears to be a wise, able, amiable minister. We dined with them at the widow Elizabeth Haines’s and had a sitting with the widow and her large family of children, which was to good satisfaction, and also the meeting was so to me in a good degree, so on retrospection.
<pb id="A0011534_049"/>
19. First Day. At our meeting, which was as open and owning a time as I ever seen. There divers appeared pleased and pleasant when we came out but I find many of our raw youths and some others of whom better things might be expected can hardly bear that our meetings should hold a quarter of an hour longer than usual.
23. Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting and I did think we were favored with something quickening, comforting, and lively although the meeting was not larger than common, notwithstanding all the great deal of preaching we have lately had preparative meeting and in a good degree satisfactory: I see no countenances or conduct or deportment marked with any more seriousness or weightiness since these great preachers have been amongst us although some went to hear them that do not go to meeting once in seven years but some countenances were marked with seriousness, sorrow, and sadness with the language of mortality and the death of near connections a just remark – There is a grandeur, a magnanimity, and glory in the primitive Christian character, which nothing on earth can ever equal. In short or in fine the most ample preparation for defense by carnal weapons endangers life and that of peace of mind without which life is of little value, nay, some have said life is not worth having without peace how then can it be purchased too dear: it has been said they can loose but little that save themselves and they who lose peace of mind sustain the greatest loss.
26. First Day. At our meeting, Lydia Lippincott had acceptable service and I thought there was something lively and evidently owning so that it was pleasant to look back and look over the day.
30 of the First Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting not to any satisfaction although the silent part seemed to me pretty well but oh the trifling indifferency unconcernedness and lukewarmness none of that ancient dew of Hermon that descended on the mountains of Zion <note resp="transcr">Psalm 133:3</note>   – the breath of Heaven must swell the sail or all the toil is lost far from the state of the prophet who could say let my right hand forget her cunning if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chiefest joy <note resp="transcr">Psalm 137:3</note>   or like our first Friends who counted nothing to dear to part with for the sake of their religion.
<pb id="A0011534_050"/>
The meeting small I cannot see that the abundance of preaching we have lately had has made any impressions or had a tendency to gather the people: it was said of old the ointment of his right had berwayeth itself <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:16</note>   but I fear there is little of that in these days too few let their lights so shine before men that others seeing their good works are animated with the ways of truth and Holiness.
{1823-02}
2. First Day. At our meeting so low and poor nearly all shut up.
6. Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting, and a satisfactory one it was to me. Simon Gilum was there and had sweet acceptable service. I dined with him and his companion Joseph Wright at Josiah Roberts and it was pleasant to look over the day.
See Hoyland’s second volume, page 240. No place is frightful to a good man, but the dungeon of a wounded conscience or an evil conscience it is the favor or displeasure of an Almighty judge that makes this or the other place or spot: comfortable or irksome. Where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty, but to the guilty, the whole world is a place of confinement. 24: How much wiser, how much more happy and safe and noble are they who live in communion with God than other men. See Proverbs 28 and 1st: The wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion. See Job 5th, 21 verse: Neither shalt be afraid of destruction when it cometh so indeed it appears to have been with thousands of the martyrs since the days of Daniel and Steven: and see the 91 Psalm 5th: verse Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day etc. read the chapter and see the great displays of Almighty power and wisdom in the destruction of the wicked and also in the preservation and deliverance of the righteous set forth in the 11th of Hebrews: He stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire out of weakness they were made strong waxed valiant in fight and put the armies of the aluns to flight. But it is said fearfulness shall surprise the hypocrite.
9th of the Second Month. First Day. We went to Cropwell meeting. Simon Gilum was there and had pertinent except, acceptable, savory service and it was an open, owning time with us to my satisfaction we dined with the stranger at Joseph Evans’s: with many others had a sitting with the family to good satisfaction: all ended well.
[marginal note] very sharp cold weather and still.
<pb id="A0011534_051"/>
Second Day Morning, 10 of the Second Month, 1823. As the word of the Lord to the people of old we read in Scripture that he said my spirit shall not always strive with man [Genesis 6:3] there is evidence that his spirit is yet striving, wooing, and inviting notwithstanding their heathenish, outlandish, idolatrous appearances in worshiping that great idol the fashions and a conformity to this world’s ways and spirit: the friendship of this world and a carnal mind are enmity with God <note resp="transcr">Romans 7:8</note>   and oh how doth it rob people of their chiefest good acceptance with God when I look at the general depravity and dissipation I am led to think of what was said of old to Ephraim let Ephraim alone he hath joined himself to idols <note resp="transcr">Hosea 4:17</note>  : How many in these days worship the works of their own Hands that which their own fingers have made <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 2:8</note>  .
See William Law’s words, page 32: The true way of turning to Gods he says that is pure and unmixed idolatry that lives wholly to self if so what abundance of idolatry there is in these days: although if anyone should say his goods or his gold was his god he would be counted an heretic but does not the language of conduct of very many say to the gold thou art my hope and confidence compass sea and land to obtain it: and I think he says in another place the heresy of all heresies an earthly mind. Page 33, he says: For self love is the greatest of all thieves: hath it not robbed and cheated millions out of their greatest riches and best treasure: peace of mind, acceptance with God, the Kingdom of Heaven.
13 of the Second Month, 1823. Was Fifth Day. At our meeting Thomas Evans and son of William and Mary Matlack daughter of George were married Elizabeth Hunt from Indiana had given general invitation and the meeting was very large and she had a great deal to say and it was no doubt to general satisfaction: our friends say in early days they had meetings wherein there was scarcely a dry eye but now it is rare to see a wet one it easier to find ten a sleeping than to find one a weeping even under the most powerful pertinent ministry powerful preachers and dull hearers the love of the world and friendships of it operated like opium stupefy and besot.
<pb id="A0011534_052"/>
14. I went to the burial of Job Cole’s wife, aged about seventy. Had been lingering and declining a long time. A violent, stormy, cold snow and hail. There was a large number of people, and conducted orderly and well, but such was the poverty and leanness I was ready to wish myself at home. There was a great mixture of sorts and sects. My old acquaintance Mary Allen, formerly Roberts, was buried the same day at Woodbury; about seventy, has suffered much of later time.
16. Was First Day. Very cold sharp freezing weather but I did get to our meeting and had no cause to repent being there it was an open owning favored satisfactory time to me once more
21. Fifth Day. Went to Evesham meeting, which was small, but I believe there were some stirrings of life and ownings of truth if I am not mistaken, as very many thousands and millions are it is to be feared who seem satisfied and contented with the performance of a round of religious duties with a sort of peace that if they would examine it they would find it was a counterfeit peace that never came from the Royal Mint: However upon the most mature deliberation I find no condemnation and the apostle says if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward God <note resp="transcr">1 John 3:21</note>   – I have often feared of late there are abundance of people who are contenting themselves with a hope that is like a spider’s web and what a dreadful thing to be deceived in a matter of such vast importance.
24 First Day. At our meeting and not to much satisfaction a violent snowy day snowed all day and all night and next day the greatest snow we have had this winter but not very cold this was the time of Burlington Quarterly Meeting when we used to say winter mostly broke up: a spirit of ease prevails.
27 Fifth Day. At our meeting E.R. and H.W. had savory service.
28 was our select meeting some life and savor as I thought although dryness and leanness attends answering our queries they seem to become like an old lesson dry and formal this has been for several days the most severe cold winter weather we have had all winter sleighs fly about more than all winter.
{1823-03}
2nd Third Month, First Day. At our meeting rather smaller than common and very poor all shut up quite silent: dissolution threatens us.
7: of the Third Month a great rain swept away the snow which has lain near two weeks and very cold.
[marginal note] 13. I went to see Margaret Peacock in a deep decline.
<pb id="A0011534_053"/>
6th of the Third Month, 1823. At our Monthly Meeting a violent storm a very great rain the meeting on the whole was in a good degree satisfactory but not quite all together so.
7. Abigail and I went to Evesham Monthly Meeting the first meeting was pretty well: and savory Elizabeth Balderston was there and I thought it end very well but I thought the meeting for discipline was old fashioned answering queries poor, dull, dry formal work yet there was room for some clost, plain, pertinent remarks to profit I hope: How we can smooth things along in investigating our state with respect to our conduct at marriage and other occasions and conclude moderation is kept to: whilst I really question whither there is greater profusion amongst any sort of people: see the equipage in carriages at these times I do not know whither a spirit of libertinism has a more full swing amongst any: and a greater departure from moderation divers young couples have given this as a reason why they went out in their marriage because our way was so expensive – a sorrowful reflection on the society that the rich travel so fast the poor cannot keep up with them as a worthy minister remarked in a select meeting.
9. First Day. At our meeting some little satisfaction waters low.
12. Went to select meeting at Haddonfield (Abbe and me) forepart seemed low and poor, old fashioned but I had a little lesson worthy of a place in the minds in all the people in the world and that was look unto me all ye ends of the earth and be ye saved <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 45:22</note>  : saved from every wrong thought and wrong way and I looked it over and over: when we came to read the queries I ventured to say something on that great and most important matter of the training up children and it seemed to kindle a zeal Elizabeth Collins and Sarah Cresson took it up and after them I had something more and that subject and then Richard Jordan took it up and expressed his full unity with the exercise of us that had spoken on the subject and then he went on in a very high degree I was ready to say I never heard the Like he told us there had been more concern to gather money than manna it was an evidently owning highly favored time to sweet satisfaction: and feeling nearness at last.
<pb id="A0011534_054"/>
13 of the Third Month. Was our quarterly meeting. John Warring from Long Island a great and worthy minister had very pointed, pertinent service respecting the dull, drowsy, lifeless state of society after him stood up Richard Jordan the old standard and almost king of America and he did make all shake and ring again there was another stranger from the Province of Maine. Townsend Hawksworth had good service in the afternoon these appear to be great ministers and I thought in the afternoon these appear to be great ministers and I thought their countenances were marked with seriousness gravity humility and meekness: do we not read there was an inscription of Holiness on all the vessels of the Lord's house [Exodus 39:30]: their faces did not look like the faces of the drunkards: dismal as some have said: some of us thought it was an highly-favored meeting throughout: a concern appeared on account of the loss state of religion by reason of the many deviations amongst old and young.
16. First Day. At our meeting not so bad but it might have been a great deal worse and not so well but it might have been a great deal better if we had not been wanting on our part I hope it ended reputably if it was not crowned as it might have been and some have been.
20. Fifth Day. A great snow storm I did not get out to meeting although the children went: I was reading a little in a little geography a school book it seems beyond conception to think of the extent of our continent and the numerous states, towns, islands, and rivers and the numerous inhabitants and it is likely all of them have a religion of some sort and it is to be feared that saying in Scripture yet remains to be true strait is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life and peace and few there be that find it <note resp="transcr">Matthew 7:14</note>  : as the primitive Christians and our worthy progenitors did and the faithful yet do who do experience the promise of Christ to meet with them and that his words are spirit and life and to say with one of old I sat under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:3</note>   I sit not to be feared that hundreds of thousands professing religion never come to experience this: yet content with a hope and a peace of some sort: and what is all the profession of religion and the Scripture good for with without acceptance with the Lord is not like feeding on wind as some of old.
<pb id="A0011534_055"/>
23 of the Third Month 1823 First Day fine weather again swept away the snow Joseph Justice and Hannah Warrington appeared and I thought it raised the life a little but oh the dissolation that abounds and want of life and ownings of truth: Notwithstanding all the abundant labor bestowed upon us what will be the end of this prevailing loathsome lukewarmness and ingratitude.
24. on Second Day. At 4 o'clock Townsend Hawksworth of Long Island appointed a meeting at our meeting House it was as large as could be expected. The stranger had a good deal to say but in a complaining way he expressed he found it hard to say any thing amongst us and spoke of the easeful state of many who go and come to meeting in an easy way like the door on the hinges.
26. A very great northeast storm of snow and rain and cold.
27. Was our preparative meeting the most lively and strengthening to me of any I have seen of latter time with desires I might be favored and preserved so as to have such favors continued.
28. Christopher Healy of Bucks County Pennsylvania appointed a meeting at our meeting House at the usual hour and I believe preached an hour or more and I thought an heavenly quiet attended at last and I fear few consider the excellency of it the work of righteousness is peace and the effects thereof quietness and assurance forever: but how many thousand there are of whom it may be said the way of peace they know not <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 59:8</note>  .
30th of the Third Month, First Day. A very great storm of rain and snow and high wind I was not well enough to go through the storm to meeting.
Second Day Morning a considerable snow no doubt it has been a suffering trying to many especially those whose business is on the waters but it was but a light trifling storm compared to some we have accounts of when people found but a precarious shelter in their houses yea many houses blowed down and buried the people in the ruins and rubbish and thousands of pounds lost in damages done to mills and other things: a wind from the wilderness smote upon the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young man and they are dead so we read of the children of Job thou shalt be visited with a storm.
[marginal note] abundance of rain this month.
<pb id="A0011534_056"/>
30 of the Third Month, 1823. Second Day. Clears up fine and moderate but the snow is not yet gone. See a pamphlet called the <italic>Reformer</italic> Ninth Month 1st 1821, volume 2nd page 282 an extract. Whoever rebels against the laws of his duty and plainly affronts the dictates of his conscience, does that moment bid adieu to all true repose and quiet and exposes himself to the severest resentments of a self-tormenting mind. And though by secret acts of wickedness he may be able possibly to drown the voice of it for a while, yet every little affliction or petty accident, will be apt to awaken it into horror and let in terror like an armed man upon him. A torment infinitely beyond what the most – ingenious tyrants could ever contrive. Nothing so effectually invades our ease as the reproach of our own minds. The wrath of man may be endured, but the eruptions of conscience are irresistible. The Scriptures say a wounded conscience who can bear – some have compared or called it unquenchable fire and some of the martyrs chose rather to be burnt at the stake than bear that unquenchable fire: the Scriptures say it is not by us to be conceived the good things the Lord hath in store for the – righteous and Addison says it is not in the power of imagination to conceive the direfull state of a wounded conscience to that effect.
{1823-04}
Third of the Fourth Month, Fifth Day. I have been so bad with my old cough and poorly I did not get to meeting heard of the death of Jeremiah Matlack seven or ten years younger than me. He has seen much unpleasant things in his day. His wife many years confined to her bed and himself many years confined to his room. I knew his father and mother from early life so we see how soon one generation passes away after another. This day received another letter from my son Joseph.
One of my friends brought me Samuel Scott’s diary to read I had seen it before but it was very acceptable: This week he says has passed pretty comfortably not much cause for condemnation having attended: nevertheless I have fallen short in respect to unnecessary words and thoughts: When we neither act speak or think anything inconsistent with the divine will: this says one is perfect satisfaction: and this is the mark of our high and Holy calling in Christ Jesus who himself was holy harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.
[marginal note] I have been poorly with a bad cough and kept house chiefly of Late 19th Fourth Month.
<pb id="A0011534_057"/>
10th of the Fourth Month, 1823. Fifth Day I ventured out to meeting though hardly able it was our Monthly Meeting – Sarah Cresson was there and shewed her zeal for the Lord had extensive acceptable service. Humility she said was the true Christian’s everyday dress. My mind was impressed at the same time with the same in substance I was viewing the vast importance of true vital religion and the blessed fruits and effects and on the other side the direful fruits and effect where it was suffered to go to decay where people cast off all religious restraint and pursue lying vanities and forsake their own mercies <note resp="transcr">Jonah 2:8</note>   and the grievous humbling things sorrow of heart and remorse of conscience destruction and dissolation that often overtake poor mortals not only individuals but even whole nation: that which I have planted will I pluck up even this whole nation oh to think of the blessed safe happy glorious state of the primitive Christians but did any either individuals or whole societies of people ever come to experience the precious fruits and effects of true religion without – humility the humble the Lord teaches of his ways and dwells with them but beholds the proud afar off. In the afternoon I thought there was some life and savor to good satisfaction – I dined with Sarah Cresson at Joseph Matlack’s – seen an account in the news of the great storm about two weeks ago. I said it would be a terrible time with people on the water and so it is said abundance of vessels on all our coasts great and small and many lives were lost but the destruction amongst the vessels was such as is very seldom heard of the vast number great and small being lost away and wrecked. 
[I have?] seen a vast large account of what they call a work of grace amongst the Baptists, Methodists and Presbyterians. I fear they will fill the world (as Stephen Crisp says) with a sort of Christians that want acceptance with God. And then what is all the profession of religion in the world good for without his acceptance and S. Crisp says their doings has been the downfall of Christianity in the present: it is surprising to think of their great inventions – I believe the Devil does not care how much religion people have if they keep clear of humility and the cross.

I have some weeks past neglected to continue my diary and concluded to drop it thinking maybe I had done enough if not too much at it but upon trial feel not quite easy. Remember what first put me upon it was William Penn’s advice to his children, which was to keep an account of every day, although a day required but a line; he said many advantages flowed from it, and further he advised them to keep a commonplace book and when they read the scriptures or any religious book if they met with passages that feelingly or livingly impressed their minds to make a note of it for he says these openings and impressions come not in the will of man no more than the Scriptures did to the inspired penmen and he says they may be lost through carelessness or overgrowing cares of the world. I believe it has been something like putting wood upon the altar to keep the fire burning as we read in Scripture for Solomon says where no vision is the people perish <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 29:18</note>   so I begin again
 
{1823-04}
27 of the Fourth Month, 1823. First Day. At our meeting and I thought there was some evidence of the ownings of truth to my comfort and satisfaction.
29. George Hatton from Indiana (700 miles they say westward) appointed a meeting at our meeting house and he did preach I think more than one hour. He is an amiable able minister but in the midst of all our ministerial labors a spirit of ease settled on the less which he mentioned on the lap of this world seems hard to reach and although they seemed to be attentive many were dull and heavy and it seemed like music to a sleepy man and but little animation: we read that 3000 were converted to the Christian faith at Peter’s first sermon and it is said as many as made up 5000 at the next sermon: and that in George Fox’s day many were convinced at one meeting but it would be a rare thing to hear of one or two being reached or tendered to tears as was frequent in them days when they say at some meetings there was few dry eyes but now it is a great rarity to see a tear: but them they say tears were frequently seen to run down their cheeks and they often tremble as they sat in their meetings and so they in scorn and derision gave them the name of Quakers and at some meetings the floor looked as if there had been a sprinkling of rain with their tears a broken heart and a contrite spirit the Lord will not despise but has promised to dwell with the humbled contrite that tremble at his word but alas how far is our state from such a state of humility and contrition as John Churchman says oh how is the ancient plainness and simplicity of truth departed and pomp and splendid appearances taken their places.

This George Hatton appears to be the great grandson of James Hatton a great and worthy minister of whom there is an excellent account in the Memorials in England page 195 his mother was a most beautiful great minister visited America I remember her words in her young days with Mary Peasly she married Thomas Lightfoot and came from Ireland and settled with her husband here in Pennsylvania her son Robert – father to this George - used to live here in this neighborhood and took to drinking to excess in his young days but was favored to make a stand against it and take up the cross and became an acceptable minister: this his son George now with us it seems moved to the western country and now his place of abode is at the place called Indiana from there we had three very great ministers very lately Daniel Pucket, Priscilla Hunt and now this George Hatton and now they have a yearly meeting there were but a few years ago it was a wilderness inhabited by the Indians, buffalo, deers, panthers, wolves, bears, etc., surely we must say with the Egyptians the finger of God is in it <note resp="transcr">Exodus 8:19</note>   In looking at this George Hatton’s father when he was a poor drunken creature it has seemed to look to me it was through the prevalence of the fervent prayers of his worthy mother he was restored and preserved and this George makes me think of Paul’s words to Timothy concerning the faith which he says dwelt in thy grandmother Lowis and in thy mother Eunice and I trust in thee also <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 1:5</note>   so we read in scripture that the fervent prayers of the righteous availeth much with the Lord <note resp="transcr">James 5:16</note>  :

4 of the Fifth Month, 1823. First Day. I went to our meeting although hardly well enough to go. Something opened to my view which made such an impression that I did not lose sight of when I got home although I kept it to myself being very poorly and one and another and another stepped in: It is said in Scripture blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled <note resp="transcr">Matthew 5:6</note>  : is there any thing of an earthly nature that can fill the desire or satisfy them that hunger and thirst after righteousness. David indeed says in thy presence is fullness of joy <note resp="transcr">Psalm 16:11</note>  : But some say none but Christ can satisfy desire it is said as we read of them in Scripture in early days they all eat of that same spiritual meat and they all drank of that same spiritual rock and that rock was Christ <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 10:3-4</note>  : who said 
<pb id="A0011535_003"/>
man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God <note resp="transcr">Luke 4:4</note>   who said my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed except you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of Man ye have no life in you <note resp="transcr">John 6:53-55</note>  : I am the true bread, etc <note resp="transcr">John 6:32</note>  : Again labor not for the bread that perisheth but for that which nourisheth the soul up unto eternal life: If they are in a blessed state that hunger and thirst after righteousness what must be the state of those be who are hungering and thirsting after wickedness: Like some we read of drinking up inequity as the ox drinketh in water <note resp="transcr">Job 15:16</note>   that say depart from us we desire not the knowledge of thy ways <note resp="transcr">Job 21:14</note>   who do not like to retain God in their knowledge as it was said of Israel they would have none of me <note resp="transcr">Psalm 81:11</note>  : they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and Hewn to themselves cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 2:13</note>  : That loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil <note resp="transcr">John 3:19</note>  : who add drunkenness to thirst <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 29:19</note>  : seeing the precious fruits and effects of righteous and the unspeakable advantages of a righteous life and on the other hand the unspeakable loss and disadvantages of the wicked not only through time but at the end of time it is matter of wonder that all the world do no hunger and thirst after righteousness like the servants of the Lord we read of who said my soul is a thirst for God as the hart panteth after the water brook so doth my soul after thee oh Lord <note resp="transcr">Psalm 42:1</note>  : again see the desires the hunger and thirst after righteousness – one thing gave I desired and that will I seek after that I might dwell in the house of the Lord where I might behold his glory and enquire in his temple <note resp="transcr">Psalm 27:4</note>  : again see the desire the hunger O that I knew where I might find him I would come even to his seat I would – order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments <note resp="transcr">Job 23:3-4</note>  .
See Deuteronomy 33:23: O Naphtali satisfied with favor and full with the blessings of the Lord: But can all this world can give satisfy them that are truly hungering and thirsting after righteousness even if they had Solomon’s possessions. See Proverbs 30:15: there are three things that are never satisfied and see Ecclesiastes 1:8: the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear with hearing neither is his eyes satisfied with – riches for they that desire silver shall not be satisfied with silver: see Jeremiah 31:34: my people shall be satisfied with goodness.
Psalms 145:16: And thou satisfieth the desire of everything: is it not so that Christ only can satisfy desire and direful are the consequence of desires misplaced.
<pb id="A0011535_004"/>
Direful indeed are the consequences of desires misplaced is it not the very cause why the world lies in wickedness for in Scripture we read that blessed are they whose minds are stayed on the Lord for they shall be kept in perfect peace <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 26:3</note>   but the Divine Master said they that love the world the love of the Father is not in them <note resp="transcr">1 John 2:15</note>   and he that loveth anything more than me is not worthy of me <note resp="transcr">Matthew 10:37</note>  . The friendship of the world and a carnal mind is enmity with God <note resp="transcr">Romans 8:7</note>  . Hence the great necessity of attention to that Scripture injunction set your affections on things above and not on things below <note resp="transcr">Colossians 3:2</note>  . Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness like the prophet who said let my right hand forget her cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chiefest joy <note resp="transcr">Psalm 137:5-6</note>   and like Paul who says neither heights nor depths or anything should ever be able to separate him from the love of the Lord <note resp="transcr">Romans 8:39</note>   as our worthy progenitors counted nothing even life itself too dear to part with for truth’s sake – but John Staupits one of the first reformers says they that prefer the creatures or anything before the Creator robs God of his highest Honor and makes that his God which he prefers: If anyone should say his temporal goods were his god he would be condemned as an heretic but how doth the daily scramble after earthly treasures demonstrate what people prefer and where their hearts is set: To them like the faithful in all ages who have preferred the truth to their chiefest joy (as James Naylor says) to those who have no other lovers whom they prefer the Lord gives himself: and with him we are rich take what he will away without him we are poor with all this world can give so that amongst all his innumerable blessings himself is the crown and all in all: If they who set their hearts on things of this world and prefer temporal treasures to God and his love rob God of his highest honor how most miserably do they rob do themselves rob themselves of the most durable riches like Achan and Gehazi <note resp="transcr">2 Kings 1:20-27</note>   who coveted the golden wedding and the Babylonish garment <note resp="transcr">Joshua 7:21</note>   and like Balaam who loved the wages of unrighteousness <note resp="transcr">2 Peter 2:15</note>   and like Demas who preferred this present world <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 4:10</note>   or like Judas that sold his master for 30 pieces of silver <note resp="transcr">Matthew 26:15</note>   and like Esau who sold his birthright for a mess of potage and then sought it with tears too late <note resp="transcr">Genesis 25:34</note>   so we may see what a most miserable bargain all these had of it who set their affections on things below and have not made a wise choice like Moses who preferred affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season <note resp="transcr">Hebrews 11:24-25</note>  .

8 of the Fifth Month, 1823. At our Monthly Meeting. William Foster from England was there and Richard Jordan. William preached about one hour but there seemed very little animation his voice and delivery not very clear and lively like some but it was thought his doctrine was sound searching and very pertinent. William Evans of Philadelphia also appeared pretty lively but at last Richard Jordan stood up and he did rouse up and make all shake he confirmed the prospect respecting I had of the great want of animation and life.
11 of the Fifth Month. First Day. At our meeting open, owning, and satisfactory to me in a good degree on mature deliberation and examination.
Second Day Morning read George Withy’s <italic>Farewell</italic> excellent address and an excellent London Epistle of 1807 both confirmed me of the opinion I have had of the lamentable neglect of the neglect in that of training up children in the way they should go. The laws that I command thee this day thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children <note resp="transcr">Deuteronomy 6:7</note>   but how lamentably do the children many suffer for want of a parental care a more guarded religious education like the shepherds of Israel was complained of they had not sought out that which was lost nor healed the sick nor brought back that which was driven away <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 34:4</note>  : But like the man who made this excuse whilst thy servant was busy hither and thither the man escaped <note resp="transcr">1 Kings 20:40</note>   and like the young man John the Divine tells of made his escape and got amongst robbers so our young people are gone into a spirit of Libertinism and are robbing of God and themselves of heavenly treasures the most durable riches manifestly denying Christ and their profession before man so that George Withy says by their dress and appearance he could not except they belonged to our society so this libertine spirit leads to outgoing in marriage which increased our Monthly Meeting business last month but alas how poor dry weak and formal without a timely care to preserve prevent and restore and reclaim I dropped some hints on the subject: But as that worthy elder John Rutty says why so much complaint of bad children and bad servants when there is so little care to make them: Better nay so far from that it is to be feared that many parents are more to blame for their children’s extravagancy and liberty than the children themselves and a danger of their hands being stained with the blood of their children. How poor weak dry and formal must our discipline be where there is no care to preserve prevent restore and reclaim which is for the better part of our discipline as William Penn says they have a right to censure who have an heart to help: and what is all our zeal for discipline good for without this heart to help which would certainly lead to a timely care to preserve restore and reclaim and which would strengthen our hands and give us authority to censure.

15 of the Fifth Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting very small. Solomon says the diligent hand maketh rich <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 10:4</note>   but slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and the idle soul shall suffer <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 19:15</note>   – Hunger oh the idleness not temporal but spiritual idleness what will be the end of it will not our poverty come as one that traveleth and our want as an armed man <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 6:11</note>   has not this been the sorrowful case with thousand and will not like cases produce like effects yet I thought we were not quite destitute of some tokens of a right spirit and savor of life.
18. First Day. Our son John being in a poor state of health we went to Evesham and was at their meeting. Ann Quicksil a maiden of a poor, low family did preach most beautifully and after her I had as open owning a time as I almost ever had there to good satisfaction oh that we could so walk as to have our mercies and blessing continued oh that thou would oft bless me indeed and enlarge my coasts said Jabez <note resp="transcr">1 Chronicles 4:10</note>  . 
22. Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and that not the worst of it very dry and formal yet I thought not quite left some life and satisfaction.
25. First Day. At our meeting I was unwell over wearied yesterday I was hardly able to sit meeting yet was favored to come off pretty well I hope yet was led to see (soon after) what a poor frail creature I am and the need there is of continual watchfulness and prayer for preservation like Jabez of old. Oh, that thine hand might be with me and keep me from evil that it may not grieve me <note resp="transcr">1 Chronicles 4:10</note>  . Last week at Fifth Day meeting and select on Sixth Day nothing material unless it was poverty and leanness although not quite destitute of life but oh how little of that to what we might experience – if we were not wanting on our part. Low mortifying times.
{1823-06}
4 of the Sixth Month, 1823. On Fourth Day. Thomas Wetherill a few years from England a young man with a young family has lately lived at Trenton but lives now at Washington in Virginia has appeared but a few year in the ministry appointed a meeting at our meeting House and was very large in testimony and very pointed, pertinent, savory and acceptable amongst the very foremost but alas what fruit have ye of all this talk about religion.
<pb id="A0011535_007"/>
I observe in reading the journals of our Friends who traveled much in the work of the ministry how they lament the want of fruit and how deeply discouraging it was to see so little fruits of their abundant labor and do we not read that Paul expressed a fear least he had bestowed labors on some in vain <note resp="transcr">Galatians 4:11</note>   and what become of the people that Noah had to preach to and what become of the people Moses had to labor with and the people Christ had to deal with after all the great works and mighty miracles doth it not evidently appear that people may tend meetings in such a way all the days of their lives to little or no purpose nay as Barclay says they may tend meetings in such a way as to suffer condemnation for it: and as some have observed they may die under a living gospel ministry whilst their affections are set on things below and are contenting themselves with a name with the form without the life: But to think of the many of latter time who have visited us great and powerful ministers I suppose there are great nations filled with millions of people Papists and Mehommitans [Muslims], barbarians, heathens and savages that are not favored with such living powerful ministers as we are and have been where are the people in like degree favored like we are.
5 was our Monthly Meeting and I believe there was some stirrings of life amongst us Nathan Smith was there and he with divers others had a lively testimony he seems to be of late just got up under sail again after being much down under the weather several years the meeting was a sweetened one to me I have a little book called <italic>Solitude Sweetened</italic> [James Meikle] and through unmerited mercy we have some times meetings sweetened all seemed open and free sweet and pleasant at last a precious cement.
This afternoon at 4 o’clock we went to the burial of Charles Roberts a stout healthy young man about 25 who died with the typhus fever with about ten or twelve days illness was much out of his senses part of the time but came to have his senses at last and was very penitent and said he was willing to die and there seemed room to hope although he had given way to folly in dress but was observed to grow more sober and steady of late. I was so weary with the long Monthly Meeting I could hardly keep up. The people behaved orderly but oh the poverty amongst professing Christians: But how ministers but all shut up.
<pb id="A0011535_008"/>
Some further thoughts concerning the burial yesterday. I do believe if there had been one half the care, concern and labor to provide for and seek after the cultivation of the inward man as there appeared as there appeared in the equipage of gilded painted curious costly carriages it seems as if there had been no cost or pains spared for the comfortable accommodations and conveniences in which accommodation and conveniences and accommodations and the greater part are entangled and bemired says William Penn, To call to a people in such a state of fullness and prosperity to seek the Lord whilst he may be found to feel after him if happily they might find him would I fear have little place with them for as Stephen Crisp says, if they in this state of friendship of this world which is enmity with God meet with that which would lead them in the ways of holiness they cannot receive it their hearts like the in of old being filled with other guest: so it is no wonder we are so very poor and destitute of savor of life and owning of truth at our burials I happened to take up John Woolman’s <italic>Word of Caution to the Rich</italic> – see page 33: To labor for an establishment in divine love where the mind is disentangled from the power of darkness is the great business of man’s life: the collecting of riches covering the body with fine wrought costly apparel and may I not add and having fine houses magnificent furniture and such exceeding new invented, fine, costly, painted carriages and gilded horses operate Woolman says against universal love, and tend to feed self so that it belongs not to the children of the light to desire these things – page 34: Our hearts being thus opened and enlarged we feel content in a use of things as foreign to luxury and grandeur as that which our redeemer said down as a pattern: Humility goes before honor but pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 16:18</note>   so we read and was is or can be expected: again see Woolman’s words, page 43: A day of outward distress is coming and divine love call to prepare against it; page 54: Christ’s example in all its parts being a pattern of wisdom the plainness and simplicity of his outward appearance may well make us ashamed to adorn our bodies with costly array or treasuries wealth by the least oppression.
<pb id="A0011535_009"/>
There is just now an alarming account in the news of a great grand horserace at New York and it is said many thousands of dollars staked between the southern and eastern states it is not long since there was an account in the news of a great parade and great and wonderful doings in Philadelphia over a fat ox. I think such daring dismal wickedness dared not to put up its head some years ago. I think they who are favored to see the right way must see the folly and vanity darkness and ignorance of the people who can take pleasure in such daring audacious wickedness as that and distilling spirits out of grain what can be expected but it will bring down judgments upon the land as in days of old – how hardened blind deaf and stupid we are we don’t consider and we will not see – the news gives account of the Hessian fly making great havoc amongst the wheat now in some parts southward – a day of outward distress is coming and divine love call to prepare against it say John Woolman, 28. It is said the fly is making great destruction amongst the wheat in Jersey and Pennsylvania.
12 of the Sixth Month, 1823. We all went to quarterly meeting at Evesham which was very large and highly favored with a living pertinent powerful ministry first Richard Jordan then Elizabeth Barton and Sarah Cresson how we are favored with a living ministry beyond many great dark nations who are filled with millions of people groaning under gross darkness ignorance idolatry and superstition and how we an ungrateful backsliding people are waited on and followed and there was something lively and savory in the meeting for discipline I was preserved so as to come off with sweet satisfaction which count a great favor and mercy for we cannot preserve ourselves.
15. First Day. At our meeting but I was so poorly I was hardly able to sit meeting out weather very warm.
19. Fifth Day. A little better I got to meeting weather very warm forepart for a while I was tried with dullness but it seemed to go off like a cloud I was favored and enabled to sit and stand the meeting out to good satisfaction: But I am jealous and often think we had need to well examine this satisfaction or peace to see whether it is of the right sort for it is to be feared thousands are content with a false peace that is not permanent I was quite tired at last.
<pb id="A0011535_010"/>
22. First Day. Rainy eastwardly storm and I unwell dizziness in my head I did not get out to meeting. It has become very dry weather; no rain this several weeks although it has looked very like for rain many times it has gone off. Heavy black clouds appeared and looked like heavy thundershowers but without any thunder or lightning and all go over and vanish away without any rain it has been the case several years past I think I never seen the like in my young days: this great appearance for rain and going off so much makes me think of the pretences we are making to religion and how little of real vital religion there is among us, how little there is now in our meetings of the company of the teachings of the spirit of truth that leads into all truth and yet we go and come from our meeting as if we got what we went for even that peace the world cannot give nor take away which is the great end of all peoples meeting together to perform worship and is it not to be feared thousands are contenting themselves with a sort of peace that will not make a death bed pleasant as the true peace will: acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace again <note resp="transcr">Job 22:21</note>   oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandment then had this peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea <note resp="transcr">Isaiah 48:18</note>   If we compare our religion with the religion of the faithful martyrs and our worthy progenitors shall we not perceive a great decay of zeal.
26. Fifth Day. My wife, daughter Abigail and I went to Haddonfield meeting which was small especially on the men’s side. I believe there are yet a little remnant of the honest hearted but many very idle sit down at ease which makes hard work for the rightly concerned. I was fatigued getting there and hardly able to sit meeting yet soon after I sat down felt better and through mercy it was a favored open owning time as I ever remember. There was pleasantness sweetness feeling nearness and much inviting shew of kindness at last but I was so weary and poorly, colic, sick stomach and dizziness in my head that it was it was with difficulty I got home: we went with an intent to go to see Esther Laning an ancient afflicted widow who had sent for us but we were told she was just then at the point of death. She has seen much trouble been blind near twenty years and suffered much with a cancer 
<pb id="A0011535_011"/>
and great trouble with several of her children but there is some room to hope she has suffered her last that her suffering are over forever.
29 of the Sixth Month, 1823. Was First Day. I was so unwell I did not go to meeting but my mind went with them. Here are some thoughts or something of the subject that occupied my mind whilst our family were gone – we read of one who inquired what shall we render unto the Lord for all His benefits towards us <note resp="transcr">Psalm 116:12</note>  : It would be right no doubt for us to try to number our blessings although they are past numbering yet would it not be great ingratitude to never think of them like the brutal part of the creation who eat the fruit under the tree and never look up from where it comes and how many blessings and benefits are we favored with which are scarcely ever thought of or considered as favors. Some years ago it was said there was not a nation known to us but what were at war and all at once peace was made so that peace prevailed over all nations: when I consider the inflammatory spirit of war and how many goodly youth were dragged out into the army and died in the wars by hardships and sickness and how many goodly people catched the inflammatory spirit of war and how they were inflamed with it I fear too few consider the blessings and benefit of peace and well would it be if humility and gratitude had been rendered as it ought to have been but if my observation have been right there never was a greater growth in a spirit of libertinism than there has been since the commencement of peace especially in the equipage in costly carriages. At the conclusion of peace this was the language of some now we will go on as we used to do now we will do as we please, etc. But we read of a war in which there is no discharge: there is no discharge in that war: and it is said a Christian life is a continual warfare Paul says I have fought the good fight I have kept the faith <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 4:7</note>  , etc., and it is said he that conquers himself conquers his greatest enemy and that a man’s worst enemies are them of his own house: But what I have chiefly in view at this time is to make some remarks concerning an army which has invaded us some years past and now this season appear in an extensive manner over our country. Virginia, Pennsylvania and Jersey an army which we cannot make war with no other way than by subduing, mortifying and humbling ourselves: an army a little like that we read of in the prophet Joel the locust, the caterpillar and the canker worm. My great army which I sent among you <note resp="transcr">Joel 2:25</note>  . That which the locust hath left the caterpillar hath eaten that which the caterpillar hath left the cankerworm hath eaten I mean the insect messenger which our friends call it in one of their epistles the Hessian fly which is now destroying the wheat in our alarming manner.
<pb id="A0011535_012"/>
Do we not read of four sore judgments: the sword, the pestilence, the famine and the noisome beast <note resp="transcr">Ezekiel 14:21</note>   and have we not had a taste of all of them although as yet but in a very small degree to what some neighboring nations of latter times have felt – the cry for bread in Ireland in England and in Germany has been very great and grievous but as John Woolman observes the judgments of the Lord have not yet extended to the degree of famine in North America – but we may observe there have been threatening signs and tokens of cleanness of teeth and scarcity of bread season after season by various means and causes have the fruits of the field and labors of the husbandman been laid waste by divers kinds of insect and by frost and by hail by blasting and mildew: and drought and sometimes by too much wet weather as an old man once told me: they thought the staff of bread would have been cut off by the abundance of wet even after the grain had been reaped and shocked in the field: this was when I was but very young and yet hath the Lord in mercy continued to feed and shower down of his benefits and blessing on North America. John Hall an acceptable European minister once told us at Cropwell that if the crops should fail but one season in America it would cause as a great cry for want of bread to pass through the land as there was then in his native land and they say in one of their epistles the poor would long feel the pinch of that time of scarcity: but in Ireland and Germany it was said many died for want of bread although thousand and tens of thousands of pounds were raised and sent for their relief. I have heard Richard Jordan mention what he had seen of the effects of famine in Germany: he said he did not believe that they who had never felt anything of it could hardly be made to believe what a piercing calamity it was. And also William Savery who also traveled in Germany and several other old countries I believe that almost always where people have lived in fullness prosperity and plenty they have ever been prone to forgetfulness ingratitude, luxury, and pride until they have many times brought down sore and heavy judgments upon them sword pestilence famine pestilence storms of hail and terrible earthquakes which have suddenly swept them away by thousands in heaps like dung; yea, as William Edmundson says lashed them with his judgments and dunged the ground with the carcasses of men and there has been a great coming down like them we read of whom it was said she came down wonderfully her filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her latter end <note resp="transcr">Lamentations 1:9</note>  . How would their jumping chariots and glittering harness look at such a striving humbling time.
[marginal note] I am just now told of a man died dismal with the bite of a mad dog it was thought.

As that we read of when it was said an ass’s head was sold for four score shekels of silver and the 4 part of a cob of doves dung for 5 pieces of silver <note resp="transcr">2 Kings 6:25</note>  : at such a time as Samuel Bownas, Thomas Story and divers other give account of most dreadful awful earthquakes when several thousand were destroyed in a few minutes when the people were alarmed and thoroughly humbled under a sense of fear of the heavy judgments that hung over them when they were ready to cry out what shall we do to be saved what will thou have me to do willing to change their trifling glittering gayeties (like them we read of in the 3rd Chapter of Isaiah) and put on sackcloth or humble themselves in any way they could to appease the anger of the Lord which they found lay very heavy on them. Paul says three and twenty thousand fell in one day for their wickedness <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 10:8</note>  : how would such pride and luxury look in such times of grievous calamity? Solomon says that it is good in the days of prosperity to remember the days of adversity <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 7:14</note>  .

2 of the Sixth [Seventh] <note resp="transcr">The entries for 2, 4 and 6 July 1823 were misdated in the manuscript journal as Sixth (June) rather than Seventh (July) month.</note>  Month. A soaking heavy rain.
4 of the Sixth [Seventh] Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting which was small Just the beginning of harvest I was but poorly and felt the effects of old age and something of the attacks of that indolent spirit which so much besets us but seemed to get over it and had to mention the words to rain if thou dost well shalt thou not be accepted <note resp="transcr">Genesis 4:7</note>  , etc. how well it would be and greatest wisdom not to sit down without experiencing acceptance for ourselves: several others appeared and I did think there was some stirrings of life and ownings of truth to some good degree of satisfaction. I find some of our weekday meeting folks think it a sufficient excuse to put by meeting on account of reaping although it is said our first Friends would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground and very great reasons they had to do so for he from whom every good and perfect gift comes they knew could yet say whither their land should or should not yield her increase – But the world’s calls seems to outbid all and the Earth has opened her mouth and swallowed up the greater part <note resp="transcr">Numbers 16:32</note>   Oh earth earth hear Oh earth <note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 22:29</note>  : It is said of the drunkard the Lord hath made the a man but thou hast made thyself a beast and how much better is it with those who have set their Hearts and affections on things below: Like Nebuchadnezzar at grass when a beast's heart was given him <note resp="transcr">Daniel 5:21</note>  : Content with earthly things only.

One of old said there is that scattereth and yet increaseth <note resp="transcr">Proverbs</note>   so I find it to be with respect to that language to Cain if thou dost well shalt thou not be accepted <note resp="transcr">Genesis 4:7</note>   are there not thousands and millions who are concluding they are doing very well who are very great strangers to that feeling acceptance which the righteous so much longed and labored for: as the heart panteth after the water brooks so doth my soul after the Lord <note resp="transcr">Psalm 42:1</note>  : If thou wouldest be with me in the way that I go and give me bread to eat and raiment to put on thou shalt be my God and I will serve the <note resp="transcr">Genesis 28:20</note>   so we may see all along it was a feeling sense of an acceptance with the Lord which they could not be content to live without: I sat under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste <note resp="transcr">Song of Solomon 2:3</note>   and our first Friends say that in the beginning when friends minds were more free from the entanglements of the world the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost was more frequently felt among them I will not give sleep to mine eyes nor slumber to mine eyelids until I find a place for the God of Jacob to dwell in <note resp="transcr">Psalm 132:4</note>  : Let me feel thy presence or else my time is lost and my life a snare to my soul: But what poor sort of talk is this to the present generation intoxicated with prosperity and what poor advice it would be to a people besotted with strong drink to urge the apostles council feel after him if happily ye may find him for he is not far away from everyone of us <note resp="transcr">Acts 17:27</note>   I know not which would be in the most unfit state to put such advice in practice: they who are intoxicated with prosperity as those besotted with strong drink oh see how many ways there are for people to be cheated out of their chiefest good which is acceptance with God: If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted <note resp="transcr">Genesis 4:7</note>   and are we not the most miserable of any part of the creation without acceptance with our maker and what a precarious situation we are in surrounded with sorrows and subject to the spoil of sickness and the sudden stroke of death and then at last acceptance with the Lord would be a treasure for transcending all the joys and pleasures riches and treasures this world can afford oh the scramble after the treasures of this world whilst the one thing needful is neglected and their chiefest good acceptance with the Lord lost the Lord's loving kindness is better than life <note resp="transcr">Psalm 63:3</note>   in thy presence is fullness of Joy at thy right hand rivers of pleasures forever more <note resp="transcr">Psalm 16:11</note>  : said David if thou doth well shalt thou not be accepted <note resp="transcr">Genesis 4:7</note>  : go thy way eat thy bread with gladness and drink thy wine with a merry heart for God accepteth thy works <note resp="transcr">Ecclesiastes 9:7</note>  : Happy for those who do so well as to experience these things for themselves but we are told that if our righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees we can in no wise find acceptance with the Lord <note resp="transcr">Matthew 5:20</note>  .

6 of the Seventh Month, 1823. I went to our meeting but my mind was so much turned towards Westfield that I could think of little else I was unwell and hardly able to sit the meeting Joseph Justice took up most of the time it was but a poor time to me: although I had – I had a very excellent lesson the apostles exhortation study to shew thyself approved in the sight of God <note resp="transcr">2 Timothy 2:15</note>   what more necessary for all the world all stand in need of his favor and without it we are the most miserable of any part of the creation all had need of that same strengthening power comfort and consolation that Habakkuk speaks of where he says although the fields should yield no meat yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation <note resp="transcr">Habakkuk 3:17-18</note>   this afternoon a pretty heavy thundershower and one very hard clap next day we found a large oak tree about eighty rod from the house in the woods tore all to shivers and splinters down to the roots I have observed trees killed with the thunder almost all round us within sight of the house and I think a walnut tree was killed that stood close to the end of the barn. How frequently do we hear of people being killed with the thunder and creatures killed with it and houses torn to pieces and barns burnt how we have been mercifully spared and favored what shall we render for all his favors <note resp="transcr">Psalm 116:12</note>   see Isaiah 29 and 6 thou shalt be visited of the Lord with thunder and see further in scriptures accounts what terrible times of thunder there has been and even down to our days. In New England their Presbyterian minister in his history of the judgments he gives most terrible accounts of thunder in Carolina on the road leading to the western territories where there is abundance of teams travel I think it was said in the news fourteen horses was killed with the thunder at one clap and divers of the men were on their backs and not hurt when the horses fell. Four men were killed with the thunder some years ago near Mount Holly in a meadow about hay but I suppose a history a volume might be filled with such accounts: Read the 78 Psalm and 48 verse he gave their cattle to hot thunderbolts.
10 of the Seventh Month, 1823. Was our Monthly Meeting just in the midst of harvest I did think it was an owning time in a good degree throughout. Elizabeth Collins from Egg Harbor had savory service I was so poorly in the morning I was afraid I was not able to sit but was enabled to sit the meeting but was so exhausted it was with difficulty I got home vomiting and lax followed. <note resp="transcr">note- the bottom right-hand corner of the manuscript is missing</note> 
<pb id="A0011535_016"/>
Seventh Day Morning, 12 of the Seventh Month, 1823. At our last Monthly Meeting we had at last the extract of our Yearly Meeting read we have line upon line, line upon line, precept upon precept, precept upon precept – epistles extracts – advices addresses and many excellent religious tracts all excellent but as I had to remark upon it: we know it is possible to sit in a room where the clock strikes all day and not be sensible of hearing it the mind and attention being otherwise taken up and engaged and what is the reason why such abundance of labor bestowed upon us has so little effects must it not be for want of attention: Listen not to the voice of the charmer although charming never so wisely <note resp="transcr">Psalm 58:5</note>   like the deaf adder Stephen Crisp tells of a way people are going on in that has filled the world with a set of Christians that do want acceptance with God and which has been the downfall of true religion at the present day and is it not a very easy matter for people to be content with a sort of religion without evidently knowing acceptance with God for themselves and what is religion good for without acceptance with God although they may shew great zeal compass sea and land to make one proselyte and carry their matters to a vast great height without acceptance with God it – will all be but as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 13:1</note>  : Be ye not as the Horse or as the mule that hath no understanding <note resp="transcr">Psalm 32:9</note>   said David. I believe there is a way a possibility of attending our religious meetings even where there is frequently a lively acceptable gospel ministry and die under it yea I do believe there is a possibility of attending religious meetings all their life long in such a way as not to be able to give an account if they were asked what they went to meeting for and never ask themselves what they gotomeeting for like the horse or the mule that hath no understanding but lively and wise enough about the cares, affairs and treasures of this world so I think I have seen that children may be brought up to meetings all their days and yet be as raw about true religion as the Indians that never seen a meeting and all this for want of setting their affections on the most desirable deserving object Is there not a clear demonstration where the heart and desires are placed see the conformity to the world both amongst aged and youth as a dear youth once remarked he said he could see but few but what were more or less swayed by custom: How are blessings abused amongst us an highly favored people much more concerned for the clothing of the body than for the clothing of the mind the inward man: no wonder there should be leanness of soul: How many even of the youth for want of health are deprived of the privilege of tending meetings who would counted it a great treasure if they were able to tend meetings but are confined with lingering [indecipherable] ulcers and cancers and consumptions, etc., and some youth came to meeting on crutches.

Attended monthly meeting at Chester Moorestown the 8th of 5 Month 1823. Present: William Forster Jr. from S Monthly meeting of quarterly meeting held at Pool in 1918, England, Richard Jordan, William Evans from Philadelphia accompanied William Foster as did H. Haines etc.
William Foster spoke in the first meeting something [?] after this manner: the children of the Kingdom were cast out etc.; it would be well for to reflect a moment who the children of the kingdom were that were to be cast out etc. what they were cast out for � now Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were to sit down together in the kingdom of Heaven and when the Jesus Messiah walk personally among men when is that prepared body said how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathered her chickens etc.
But ye would not (Mark says here they were under no moral impossibility of predetermined fiat [?], but might have received the Messiah in the way of his coming; for to as many as did receive him to them them he gave power to become the Children of God of Heaven. He spoke much about the propitiatory sacrifice and not to call the precious blood and unholy thing etc.
The Devil, that power, that went about like a roaring lion etc. was neat, and no imaginary power or being etc., for which he cautioned against etc.
I thought he endeavored to show that among all the families of this Earth the Quakers were the Lord�s peculiar prophets, and that there was no doubt at all but the covenant that was made with our predecessors of primitive Friends would last to the end of the world; and the Lord�s minister or messengers among us now (that is the preachers by their ministry would do a great deal of good in disseminating the knowledge of the Lord, until it should and would cover the Earth as waters do the Sea.) mentioned there were those of us who were upon the heights of speculation, and finding and easier way to Heaven that did our first Friends etc, but they would fall, and in his judgment no matter how soon, etc. Williams said "he" was never made to be a sharp [illegible] instrument for it was more disagreeable to him to speak [illegiable], than it could be for anyone to hear etc., yet he spoke sharply to the sisters against their being some of them worldly minded and having on [illegible] instancing "Lazarus, come forth" etc. 
<pb id="A0011536_002"/>
After William sat down, William Evans rose, said he could not expect to add anything to the foregoing testimony of divine truths which had been delivered which fully accorded with his sentiments etc. � Then enlarged and the visited of the Lord would have the victory if it was through suffering and encouraged to hold out in well doing, and let no man spoil you this philosophy etc. Afterwards said the God head [?] was bodily in Jesus [illegible] to see that text when I am at leisure etc.
Richard Jordan seemed to think although the meeting was appointed for discipline [?] he thought a simile might be added to [illegible] be very illustrative. Suppose I (says he) or any other man was under sentence of death, by a broken law, which if it was to be executed must die. It would fill us with amazement, but if some unknown one should offer to die for us � for he said he thought the Apostles thought it a possible case, that some on might be found that would die for a good man, but could any be found that would die for a sinner etc. Then made the application as I thought to view the situation of us poor mortals who had all fallen short of the glory of God, but Jesus Christ our savior bought us with his precious blood. That is as I thought endeavored to show that Christ has made a way for us to be reconciled to God by our having time with the assistance of the Holy Spirit to make our peace, r reconciliation etc, before the time of probation be over etc. The [?] were then closed R. Jordan kept to his seat some of the Friends, inviting him to another.
William Foster Jr. remarked that the charge he thought brought against any for them outgoing in marriage ought to state the mode in which it was accomplished, as well as "that it was accomplished contrary to discipline" viz "whether it was done by a priest of minister of another denomination" or "by a magistrate when one was a member", "or when both was members.' � William instanced his own marriage was accompany with what he wanted not part with for all the world, etc.
Nathan Morgan's request to become a member was granted at this time.
William Evans cautioned Friends against too lightly or easily, or in this words those that came in by [illegible] should show forth in life and conduct they were [illegible], and manifest such concincement by fruits etc., such as steady attending meeting [illegible] walking. 
<pb id="A0011536_003"/>
I left my home and come to see you with nothing in my hand but the staff of life. It is my support � it is my shield � and this I have declared the Inhabitants [?] of the Earth and I have had to declare in every part of the Earth where I have been that there is no other guide to learn but the light of Christ within. And this all may clearly see that will attend to the light of Reason, for it is that part of man that is susceptible of light and by this light operating on the mental faculty I term Reason that which raises the man above the brute we are enabled to see and come unto the light of Christ within the hope of glory. It shows us that he is the way, the truth and the life, and this great gentle monster it is, that is to guide us to heaven. Now beloveds, do I say reason is the light that leads to Heaven? No. I put no more dependence on reason than is due for reason done cannot guide a man in the way that is right. He undoubtedly was endowed with reason � for a man that is void of reason cannot know Christ � neither will he be lead by his light within, for he disregards it. His mind is not capable of Reason. Here bellowed, as we attend unto this Monster in the breast, the light of Christ, we are led unto God the fountain of light � we come to the knowledge [light of Christ crossed out] ourselves. It unfolds to the view of men what he really is and there is nothing else but this that can guide a man to peace but that which has however to open to the view of his mind what he really is � for until a man does see and know himself he cannot come to the knowledge of God. Where is there any other power that can guide a man into the depth of nature but this eternal words? For by diving into the depth of nature we behold nature's God. Him we see in all his works. We behold him above all and filling all and the light of Christ within is the Lion of the Truth of Judah that is prepared to open the book and loose the [illegible].

25 of 3 month 1824. At our preparative meeting their was some pamphlets handed out which Friends had ordered to be printed and spread, giving an account of the enormous practice of the slave trade yet continued, notwithstanding divers nations have made laws to prohibit that most barbarous trade. The great number of vessels there is now employed in that trade so that they are bringing  the poor Negroes away from their native lands of near and dear connections by hundreds of thousands and [indecipherable] them into slavery to many of the various. One account seems to display a manifest judgement upon them. A vessel loaded with Negroes after they had got out to see, a strange disorder in their eyes came  upon them and both whites and both went quite blind so that they were unable to steer the vessel. Another vessel came up with them of whom they begged help, but attained none, they fearing their disorder, and it was believed them they all perished in the see. About twenty years ago I was traveling in the western territories on the River Ohio, we lodged at a tavern whereas some men had got fifty-two Negroes from the Southern states and were taking to a place called the Natchez some hundreds of miles westward. There were men, women and children, the men in chains and the women had two sucking babes at their breasts handcuffed with irons. To see and feel the darkness and hardness of their oppressors hearts was painful to be  in their company. I suppose to drown their sorrow: see Psalms 137 and 3rd For they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth etc. Some years ago I picked up a bit of newspaper off the floor wherein was an account of a vessel with 130 Negroes (of the Mantanzes) which was struck with thunder and the vessel sunk in a few minutes and all perished but the Captain and his mate who lashed some spars together and floated on them near two weeks but was found and taken up by a wrecker * that is a vessel looking for shipwrecks. But the Captain and his mate had laid so long in the water they had quite lost the use of their limbs. Some years ago there were some men from the Southern States brought a number of Negroes to Redstone (on their way further to west). Whilst at Redstone a strange sickness on them and a number of Negroes died and one of the two brothers that had them in keeping died. The other set off back to get help and he also died. The Inhabitants being alarmed hired a man to conduct them down the river westward and he also died so the poor Negroes were left without Oppressors or Masters or Caretakers. What became of them I have not heard. But does not these appear singular judgements.
*[star and comment written later] Query Does not the preservation of Captain and Mate seem marvelous?
<pb id="A0011537_002"/>
A more perfect account of the Negroes brought to Redstone [illegible] of a letter from Elisha Hunt of Redstone 5 month, 16[th day], 1818. Just before we got home 4 brothers with a large company of black slaves came to town. The blacks took sick; 6 or 8 dies. The brothers took sick likewise, and 2 of them died. Here the inhabitants became alarmed and put them into a boat and started them away. One of the brothers died in the boat. The other hired a citizen of this town to navigate the boat and the other started back to Virginia for some assistance and died in the mountains of Charlestown and has left a family here. Thus 5 men have died besides the 6 or 8 Negroes. The blacks are at Charlestown in Miammi or Ohio of those that survived. Is not this an alarming hint to Negro traders. Near the last of 4th month 1824. J.H.

27 of the Sixth Month, 1824. First Day. Asa Matlack went with me to Haddonfield meeting. I remember in my youthful days the name of Haddonfield meeting sounded very savory – there were many famous standard bearers who had attained a good report but they are now very much stripped of their standard bearers and many are become like a standard bearer when he fainteth: yet there are a few name as in Sardis of old preserved <note resp="transcr">Revelation 3:4</note>  : I was very poorly and hardly able to keep up but having my mind turned towards them and way opening I went in hopes I should feel better by going out in the fresh air as I have often experienced but was not so this time but thinking it was better to wear away than rust away as many do and as one said when he went to meeting through the most difficulty he had experienced that he went to best purpose the meeting to me was pretty open and satisfactory although I was hardly able to sit much less to stand. I was so poorly all day I was hardly able to keep up but got home and after a refreshing night’s sleep and looking over the day I thought I experienced what one formerly said there is that which scattereth and yet increaseth <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 11:24</note>   I thought if things had flowed so into my mind when with them I could have done much better and I don’t know when I should have done Just now 84th: year of my age Second Day morning as well as usual a rainy morning and I believe much hay catch in the wet weather we have some out in the wet there is token of much rain although the winter was very hard on the winter grain but very little snow yet the spring season has been very favorable and wheat and rye and grass seldom if ever looked more promising well will it be if it has an humbling effect as it should have instead of the contrary: and we be like the man we read of whose ground brought forth plenty fully and he concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years and he would say to his soul eat drink and be merry but God said unto him thou fool this night shall thy soul be – required of thee then whose shall these things be which thou hast provided so shall it be with all those that lay up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God <note resp="transcr">Luke 12:16-21</note>  : it is said in Scripture Ephraim is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself <note resp="transcr">Hosea 10:1</note>   and is it not to fear that there is very many such in these days of great plenty and prospects.

29 of the Sixth Month, 1824. We were informed that our dear dutiful affectionate son John was very ill with convulsion fits he had been afflicted with some light ones a considerable time past at times but now more violent. Third Day went to see him and Hinchman Haines told us he had had twenty fits since he came about 11 o’clock last night. They came upon him every hour but not so hard afternoon he seemed to revive and appeared sensible but could say but very little I asked him if he knew <italic>make</italic> said Father: but the fits soon came on him again and continued till about 11 o’clock. On Third Day night he died: on Fifth Day. At 4th hour people met to the burial and a solemn time it appeared to be. Ann Quicksill, an acceptable young minister, had something to say to the people very savory and acceptable, and there was something satisfactory at last and comforting. He was about 46 years old, has left a worthy widow and five children, and they buried one a daughter a few years ago. He told his daughter Susannah when he was first taken poorly he did not expect to live much longer and he said he hoped he should suffer his last here and hopes he should go where – trouble would be no more and we have no doubt but he is gone out of the reach of trouble where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest for he has been preserved from the spots and stains of his world in a good degree: I never knew him tell a lie nor swear nor steal or cheat. He joined his friends in testimony zealously against drunkenness and the excessive use of strong drink unchastity and profane language he appeared to stand very clear of. He has left three sons and two daughter as comely, innocent, sweet spirited, well disposed children as I know of. If he had shortened his days with hard drinking as many do or in rioting lightness or vanity in superfluities as many do his latter end might have been very different from what it was.
Heard of the death of Joseph Scattergood, son of the worthy Thomas. Middle aged. Left a large family of children his wife was William Roger’s his daughter: and of the death of John Field both of Philadelphia and oh we see how the fashion of this world passes away and how transitory it is how many can say with one of old, few and evil have been the days of thy servant [Genesis 47:9].

8 of the Seventh Month. At our Monthly Meeting. Middling, not much animation.
11. First Day the first time we met at 10 o’clock which prevailing party had concluded all our meetings should begin at 10. It was quite silent and not satisfactory to me: go and learn what these things meaneth etc. was what arrested my mind but the waters seemed too low to say anything.
15. Fifth Day. My wife so unwell as to keep her bed all day and Hannah has the ague and fever and myself very poorly none of us got to meeting. Weather very warm.  It tries me more than the cold weather I am so feeble I can hardly crawl about.
18. First Day. My granddaughter Mary went with me to Evesham meeting but I was so poorly it was hard for me to keep up on my feet yet the meeting was to some satisfaction although I seemed not able to clear myself I thought it ended some savor I wanted to see my dear grandchildren and their mother my son John’s worthy widow who seemed to bear their loss commendable.
A few days ago Josiah Roberts’s house was burnt down by burning the chimney: where his tenant lives on the old homestead place where the dear old Israliteish friend Robert Frinch used to live. See the way and fashion of this world how it passes away. Second Day morning a fine shower a prospect of a very plentiful season may it prove a blessing – for what man’s condition can be worse whom plenty starves and blessing curs prosperity and great plenty has ever proved the greatest trial on virtual or true religion all along in the accounts of the suffering of the martyrs when ever they were tried with ease and prosperity they began to differ amongst themselves about trifles about the meaning of a passage of Scripture their creeds and ceremonies so amongst our first Friends when they were released from sufferings frailties and deficiencies prevailed among them which could not when under the greatest suffering.  Hence it is said few ever bore prosperity unhurt or without loss of the best life few ever made better by great riches yet they might be as rich as Job or Abraham if they were as faithful as they were.
<pb id="A0011538_004"/>
20 of Seventh month. See memorial concerning Sarah Morris, page 344. But too many are contented without witnessing the renewings of divine life in which only there is life – if they are but preserved from gross evils and go on in prosperity: they sit down easy and think all is well; but oh that they may (not too late) find their mistake and that they have pleased themselves with favors which they have unthankfully received and so stop short of greater by not desiring them: see here the dangerous state of prosperity, peace, and plenty – has not many more been cheated out of their chiefest good in this way than by the love of strong drink which Anthony Benezet supposes fifty million are destroyed yearly by the excessive use of strong drink. The unlawful love of lawful things some of the greatest experienced say is the greatest snare the crafty devil ever had to catch religiously inclined people, greater than that of strong drink, says Thomas Ross and Thomas Shillitoe in his late excellent address, hence the advice of the apostle, set your affections on things above and not on things below <note resp="transcr">Colossians 3:2</note>   – for as we see direful are the consequence of desires misplaced: a rainy day.
One of my neighbors brought me a newspaper to shew me a sermon preached by our kinswoman Priscilla Hunt at New Bedford in New England, Fourth Month 15, 1824, where I see several accounts of some being killed with thunder and vessels struck with the lightning in a terrible manner: in a thunder shower last week near Portsmouth, New Hampshire the electric fluid struck the south schoolhouse in which were about seventy scholars more than half the number were knocked down and many were stunned. Eight or ten were unable for some time to rise up and six or seven when first taken up by the master were apparently dead. Twelve or fourteen were more or less injured the clothes of one took fire and he was considerably burnt and the hair of another singed. All are however recovered or hopefully recovering except two who were instantly deprived of life: two lads, one eleven and the other seven years old. Scarcely a summer but we hear of such awful accounts.
22. Fifth Day. At our meeting smaller than common about thirty on the men’s side a very busy time getting hay. Harvest mostly got in. A number of this small number very sleepy yet to me it was a time of renewal of strength and on deliberation satisfactory although I feel so much of the infirmaries of old age.
[marginal note] [indecipherable] or open apostates ever did us that hurt that prosperity has done
<pb id="A0011538_005"/>
30 of the Seventh Month, 1824. At our meeting middling large and to me I thought I was an evidently owning, satisfactory, favored meeting more of that precious cement than I have known some time feeling nearness and uniting regard when we came out and parted.
Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and very poor and silent a busy time getting hay and oats etc., and some sick. No signs of the stirrings of life, a state very different from that our first Friends speak of when they say the powerful over shadowings of the Holy Ghost were frequently witnessed among them when their hearts were tendered even to tears in their silent waiting so that sometimes there was scarcely a dry eye amongst them and they sat trembling in such a solid manner that their very enemies were convinced and the mouths of gainsayers stopped. Religion is not such a trifling thing that there is neither good nor harm in it though very many treat it as if it was so: no worth troubling themselves about it so pay little or no regard to it: until all earthly comforts fail – which we see they often do fail which we see the often do and surely must there is a way of attending meetings to the greatest and most glorious of purposes and there is a way of attending them to no purpose as Paul says not for the better <note resp="transcr">1 Corinthians 11:17</note>   may we no certainly conclude that if we tend our meetings as not for the better it will be for the worse: the best of meats taint the soonest and the best of things misused become the worst: among our first Friends the privilege of attending meetings was among their best thing for they attended them at the hazard of their lives and their persecutors said they would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground they could – rejoice in the reward of peace: which is the wages of the faithful more than the increase of corn, wine, or oil: or all earthly treasure they knew that would sustain uphold and support them when all earthly treasures would fail but how can we sit down easy with the performance of a round of religious duties without the life or an answer of peace which is all we meet together for and is enough: But to tend meetings in a trifling, indifferent, dry, formal way in a dull drowsy loathsome lukewarm way as Priscilla Hunt told was an abominable sacrifice what can operate or mitigate more against the cause [it] was profess[ed]  to espouse. It has been said that truth has ever suffered disgrace to any trade or business even market people got nothing by it.

1st of the Eighth Month 1824. First Day. At our meeting pretty large and an open favored time to me and there was tokens of its being satisfactory to others there appeared openness feeling nearness in some however the lukewarm were stirred up and those in a striving way encouraged I was much exhausted when I got home my son Joseph’s wife was here and his son Nathan and his wife and child one of the sixth generation in my family I have now lived to see my grandson Nathan Hunt’s little daughter my son’s grandchild.
5. Was our Monthly Meeting I thought smaller than common and I thought it was a low time and no wonder to see the easy indolent state of us high professors: rich wise diligent and careful and full of earthly treasures but poor dull and unconcerned respecting that of witnessing the renewings of divine love in which only there is life yet poor and low as things seemed to be we seemed not altogether destitute of some stirrings of life and tokens of the ownings of truth for my friends seemed to own me although I dealt very close and plain with those at ease in Zion and are trusting in the mountains of Samaria <note resp="transcr">Amos 6:1</note>  , etc.
8. Was First Day. At our meeting I had something very close and striking but kept it to myself another stepped in and took up all the latter part of the meeting.
12 was Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and very poor till last then appeared some stirrings of life and ownings of truth several of our you ministers appeared savory and it ended to my satisfaction in a good degree of sweetness and savor.
15. First Day having a desire to see my daughter-in-law my son John’s widow and her children we went to Evesham meeting which I think was more lively than common (Ann Quicksil a granddaughter of that worthy elder Ephraim Tomlinson <note resp="transcr"><italic>Friends Miscellany</italic> 3 (1832): 145-152, includes a lengthy “Testimony” by John Hunt on Ephraim Tomlinson, dated 17th of 8 Month, 1824, and an “Extract of a Letter from the same” dated 8 Month 24, 1824.</note>  an Israelite indeed of unblemished character) spoke very beautifully and Elizabeth Balderston also and after them I had a favored open time to good satisfaction – something owning feeling nearness and uniting regard appeared at parting I came home very much tired and expected being very poorly afternoon dined at Hinchman Haine’s and called to see Samuel Lippincott at Asa Roberts who is very poorly lately had a stroke of palsy but now chill and fever.
19. Fifth Day. At our meeting nothing material.
22. First Day. At our meeting almost not quite overwhelmed with a dull indolent spirit the sluggard shall be clothed with rags his own righteousness which are as filthy rags.

29 of the Eighth Month, 1824. At our preparative meeting very small about thirty or forty on the men’s side has been the number of late although it may be with us as it was with Israel of old when it was said the Lord gave them their heart’s desire but sent leanness into their souls <note resp="transcr">Psalm 106:15</note>  . Although leanness and poverty did abound in a great degree yet there was something of the stirrings of life and savor of truth at last. But oh: the dullness and want of life in answering the queries. As Thomas Shillitoe says it is painful to sit and hear and see and feel the feebleness in transacting this business. Many or divers families sick with chill and fever and many deaths we lately hear of Sarah Haines an elder, wife of Job, died with very short illness and five or six others we hear the death of: within a few days and divers in the very bloom of life: I have heard that the flux is very mortal at Julitown a few miles above [Mount] Holly it is said five were buried in one day in one graveyard: one would think it was an alarming awakening time: but it seems as if nothing but death itself can awaken the people fallen asleep in the lap of this world and rocked in the cradle of ease and carnal security: as a certain minister said the time will come when the enemy can rock the no longer: and as Solomon says how long will thou sleep oh sluggard how long will it be ere thou awake out of sleep yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of he hands to sleep so shall thy poverty Come as one that traveleth and thy want as an armed man <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 6:9-11</note>   although possessed of thousands: Abraham Cole very rich and Isacar Meeks very poor both buried today but I was so poorly I was hardly able to keep up: both young men between 20 and 30 Isacar Meeks worked for us last season: very thoughtless about leaving this world to all appearance many many many appear to be.

1 of the Ninth Month. At our meeting. William Forster from England was there lately returned from his visit in New England since last spring and he had a great deal to say stood an hour or more but I could hear but little of what he said but I am told it was very pertinent and excellent. But I could perceive but little or no animation tenderness or contrition nothing like what our first Friends tell of two or three hundreds convinced at one meeting where they say there was scarcely a dry eye amongst them at some meetings and they trembled as they sat the tears running down their cheeks. His voice and delivery not so pleasing as some. Many very dull and drowsy whilst he was preaching: and although the language of mortality sounds louder and louder daily. We hear of burials: Charles Towns a young man to be buried this afternoon of Evesham and we hear of divers now very ill of a fever male and female. Better to see ten men weeping in meeting than one a sleeping like Euticus when Paul was preaching till midnight <note resp="transcr">Acts 20:9</note> .
[marginal note] Sarah Haines was at my son John’s burial last of the Sixth Month cheerful and well. Little did she think her time was so short: she spoke encouraging to me.

31 of the Eighth Month, 1824. On Third Day I went with my neighbors Josiah Roberts and wife and Samuel Church to Burlington Quarterly Meeting a very rainy stormy morning the house pretty well filled. Richard Jordan, William Forster and many others great ministers there but it seemed to be a poor low time no less than five small appearances in the forepart who seemed to love to paddle in shallow water but at last Richard Jordan rose up but did not rise very high but seemed to help in the time of answering queries things seemed to me to be very old fashioned dry and formal they are scholars and capable of transacting their business like lawyers or casting up merchants accounts. I had some close remarks to make on the state of society but there seemed neither time nor heart room to do much in the present state yet it end better than some of us expected as some expressed I had sweet satisfaction in the company of many of my friends and relations and we returned with good satisfaction as several expressed: seen and heard from divers of my friends in Pennsylvania and distributed divers letters to good satisfaction one to William Forster and divers others in viewing the day’s work after a refreshing sleep felt peace and satisfaction and I was favored with strength to keep up although a rainy stormy day. I hear that the dysentery or flux is or has been very mortal in Egg Harbor in divers places and the fever and chill and fever in many places. Divers very ill.
2 of the Ninth Month. At our meeting small poor and low yet at last I ventured to stand up with a prospect of saying a few words and was evidently helped beyond prospect or expectation to good satisfaction. I stayed at Moorestown all night lodged at Morgan Hollinshead’s whose wife and Mary Lippincott who lives there were very exceeding kind to me. I visited several families to sweet satisfaction to myself and them as they expressed.
3 Sixth [Day] of the week was at our select meeting at Moorestown an owning strengthening time to me I believe: however openness feeling nearness and sweetness appeared amongst us: some clothing to cover my nakedness although life seems so low and I so feeble I seem hardly able to totter about. But oh the dryness and dullness in answering our queries is painful indeed as Thomas Shillitoe remarks but bright and wise in temporals.
5. First Day. Having a desire to see my son John’s widow and children I went to Evesham meeting. I was so unwell and feeble I could hardly keep up. A poor time hardly clothing to cover our nakedness no satisfaction except that of seeing my grandchildren and their mother.

7th of the Tenth [sic. Ninth] Month 1824. <note resp="transcr">Ann Quicksall’s death, cited in the passage below, was in 9th month 11th 1824, not 10th month; she was aged 33 and was buried in Friends burial ground in Evesham. John Hunt died less than two weeks later.</note>  Was our Monthly Meeting rather smaller than common but it was a strengthening, favored time to me if I am not mistaken both in the first and last meeting for discipline although in answering our queries as usual want of life and savor: superficial dry formality trifling indifferency and loathsome lukewarmness now when the fruits of the field of every sort are in abundance especially apple and peaches more than can be used and abundance rot on the ground we hear of much sickness and frequent deaths and in particular amongst the youth one about nineteen near Cropwell died with a fever with about three days illness divers such instances there have been lately of lads or young men suddenly snatched away in their full strength and divers we hear of laying now very ill but it seems to make very little impressions on those left behind.
10 of the Tenth [sic. Ninth] Month. First Day. We went to the burial of Ann Quicksil at Hinchman Haines’s. She died of a fever with a few days illness about twenty years of age or more she was a very hopeful minister of an unblemished character she preached to us at my son John’s burial last of the Sixth Month. Sarah Haines was also there in usual health now both gone to their long homes and room to hope they are gone to a better world. Hinchman Haines and myself had something to say to the people at the house and Ebenezer Robert and Hannah Warrington took up most of the time at meeting. The day ended to my satisfaction in a good degree: there was another burial of an ancient woman at the same time about a quarter of a mile off.
