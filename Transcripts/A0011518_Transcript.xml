Said their labor though small might be of more service than they were aware of. Coming from such or such a one it might be like bread cast upon the waters that might be gathered after many days,<note resp="transcr"> Ecclesiastes 11:1</note> and mentioned something what a pity it would be if the Lord should be disappointed of his servants. It seemed to strike me having great reason to think it was for me.
After this meeting was over a committee appointed from our Monthly Meeting stayed to gather to consider the case of those children amongst us whose parents one had a right and the other none, who unanimously agreed that we ought to observe the words of the minute of the Yearly Meeting made in the year 1772.

<div type="entry" when="1774-07-17"><dateline><date when="1774-07-17">17th of the Seventh Month, 1774.</date></dateline> Went to our meeting a very P[oor] D[ull] H[eavy] T[ime] W[ith] Me. I found an account in the life of Thomas Story, page 221 and part in 224 as follows:
In the year 1699 many being taken away at Philadelphia by a pestilential fever then greatly prevalent ten being buried in one day and four died on the same several of them being good Friends. In page 224, he says my companion and I both remained in the town till the 23 of the month visiting the sick Friends from time to time as we found necessary or expedient, and great was the presence of the love of God with his people in the midst of this trying visitation which gave us occasion to say, good is the Lord and greatly to be feared, loved and obeyed for though he suffer afflictions to come upon his own chosen people in common with other men yet that which otherwise would be intolerable is made as nothing by how much sense the[re]of is swallowed up and immersed in his divine love, O the melting love! O the immortal sweetness I enjoyed with several as they lay under the exercise of the devouring evil, though unspeakably comforted in the Lord. Let my soul remember it and wit low before the Lord to the end of my days!
Great was the majesty and hound of the Lord! Great was the fear that fell upon all flesh! I saw no lofty or airy countenance; nor heard any vain jesting to move men to laughter; nor witty repartee, to raise mirth, nor extravagant feasting to excite the lusts and the desires of the flesh above measure: but every face gathered pal[e]ness and many hearts were humbled and countenances fallen and sunk as such that waited every moment to be summoned to the bar and numbered to the grave.
But the just appeared with open face and walked upright in the street and rejoiced in secret that perfect love that casteth out all fear and sang praises to him who liveth and reigneth and is worthy forever being resigned unto his holy will in all things, saying let it lie as thou will in time and in eternity now and forever. Nor love of the world nor fear of death could hinder their resignation, abridge their confidence or cloud their enjoyments in the Lord.
This companion of his died in Philadelphia with the fever.</div>

At this time I was favored to see I was greatly behindhand and that I had suffered great loss for want of true stillness and keeping love and humble enough and by not keeping in a right spirit when talking with some about our Monthly Meeting business.

Robert Walker spoke at the table and his discourse was very agreeable, telling us that he had seen George Fox his house and his cane and William Dewsberry’s house and cane.

And it came so tight I was almost ready to wish I had never made any pretences to religion and I was somewhat disconsolate for several days but taking up a Bible one evening I opened on this verse: Let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil that shall not break my head, for yet my prayer also shall been in their calamities. Psalms the CXLI. 5th verse.<note resp="transcr">Psalms 141:5</note> I remembered the wounds of a friend are said to be faithful <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 27:6</note> and that them that are loved ones are chastened. After this I thought I was favored to see that this testimony was a favor if rightly minded and my mind was settled under it, and I clearly saw that we stood in great need of it. Her testimony was very close against a worldly spirit. concerning many, nay she said all, was more or less deeply fettered and in the miry stiff clay and that our garments was spotted but that there was some that was endeavoring to have those spots washed out, but some she said was bound down to the world as with iron chains. I was favored to see there was need of getting deeper.</div>

<div type="entry" when="1777-01-19"><dateline><date when="1777-01-19">19.</date></dateline> We went to our meeting on First Day and there had a company of most distressed creatures. Lodged in our meeting house the night before and they were so distempered that the house smelt so bad (see Amos 4 and 10) wars stink of your camp etc. <note resp="transcr">Amos 4:10 "I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord</note> 
We could not bear it. It was littered and dirtied so that it was almost like a stable and the neighboring people told us that they [were] exceeding lowly and the people of Moorestown was very much distressed with these sort of people. At this time they told us that they were soldiers that were taken prisoners last spring amongst the English however they were taking them in wagons to Philadelphia and we were informed that they died so fast at Philadelphia that they dug great caves and buried a number together.
We kept a little meeting at Jacob Hollinshead’s and some friends went to Jacob Stokes’s and kept a little meeting. This day we heard of four burials at Mount Holly, viz. Elizabeth Burr daughter of Hannah Foster and died at William Foster’s, went there to her mother’s burial and was there taken sick and died; the other Samuel Swain’s wife; the other Samuel Burr; the other a soldier. 
Abundance of poor distressed soldiers wounded and prisoners were taken to Philadelphia about this time. I was lately [with] a man that said it was his business to dress the wounded at Burlington [and] that they had turned about sixty through there to a place ordered farther in Pennsylvania.</div>

<div type="entry" when="1777-01-20"><dateline><date when="1777-01-20">20th of the First Month, 1777.</date></dateline> I went to Haddonfield to the burial of Edward Gibbs is wife. Joshua Evans spoke very well and several others. This day Nigah Peacock was buried, a very ingenious man in Evesham. He had since the wars began erected a powder mill and carried in on to considerable perfection till one day he was at work amongst his powder and by some means it catched fire and killed him and hurt several of his family. Besides it was said that the roof of the house was blown off and very much shattered to pieces with the blast of the powder; however the report of the powder was heard very heavy like a great cannon ten miles round. I really thought that it had been a cannon and I was about ten miles from the place. His powder catched fire once before and he narrowly escaped.</div>
<div type="entry" when="1777-01-22"><dateline><date when="1777-01-22">22 First Month, 1777.</date></dateline> I went with my friend Joshua Evans to see the poor Indians at Edgepelick and we found them in a very low circumstance as to food and raiment. Joshua took them a considerable parcel of old clothes with which the poor naked children seemed exceedingly pleased. Joshua had been under some concern for these poor creatures and proposed to them that if they could get some money he would try to get some blankets for them and so mentioned the case amongst his friends and collected a parcel of blankets for them (gratis) and so made them for pay for them at a moderate price and when he had got their money he laid it out in corn for them, not letting them know what he intended to do with their money till after he delivered the blankets, this he did because these poor things are too apt to lay out their money in strong drink. This visit to these poor creatures was an instructing lesson to me though they were so poor there seemed to be innocency unity quietude and peace amongst them at a time when it was much otherwise with the white people not only great rumors and confusions of wars but there was abundance of difference about roads at this time.
This visit was very satisfactory to me. We went to a run to drink and Joshua lay down on his belly to drink and I asked him if he had rather drink so than be served in a silver cup he answered much rather. We returned home with the increase of true satisfaction and peace, enlargement of hearth and fortitude of mind and tenderness, and it was much more agreeable to me to be with them than with the haughty and great. Amongst the elderly women there was countenances that bespoke gravity humility innocency and tranquility. There was one Indian woman that had a child just three weeks old that morning and she was so well that it seemed as if nothing had ailed her at all. This I could but remark because her cabin was so open- not so tight and warm as our stables are in common which, under consideration of the weakly ness of our women at such times, caused me to conclude that the more tenderly we kept and nursed ourselves and children the more tender and weakly we were.
[Right marginal note] And the weather very cold and no bed but a little straw and a few blankets and yet she seemed pretty cheerful though but a bushel of Indian Corn in the cabin and husband gone] 
Their children were all very healthy. This visit made me think how lavish we feed and pamper our bodies with corn whilst there are so needy, yet they on the whole as much if not more happy and content than we and as likely to answer the end of their creation as far as I know.</div>

<div type="entry" when="1777-01-30"><dateline><date when="1777-01-30">30.</date></dateline> First Month. We went to our meeting preparative which was seemed to end for the better. After meeting was over we had some concerning the present trials friends were under which I believe was strengthening and edifying to some.</div>
<div type="entry" when="1777-01-31"><dateline><date when="1777-01-31">31.</date></dateline> About home. In this conference some Friends proposed to go to the governor for redress which was done and answered their expectation. Next morning the thing opened on my mind after this manner: sacred records informs us that it is not in man to direct his steps, that the Ethiopian cannot change his skin nor the leopard his spots,<note resp="transcr">Jeremiah 13: 23</note> that the preparation of the heart and answer of the tongue is after the Lord and that a broken heart <note resp="transcr">Proverbs 16:1</note> and a contrite spirit he will not despise.
[Left marginal note] I have heard saying If the Lord [is] for us no [ma]tter who is against us.<note resp="transcr">Romans 8:31</note>
I have thought that if our minds were turned this way in true humility and resignation our innocent conduct and deportment would be our best advocate in the most trying season. Though our tongues were quite silent there would be a powerful language in our innocent conduct and deportment and this I believe would do more for us than the best prepared arguments of men’s invention.</div>
