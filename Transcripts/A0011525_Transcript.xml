The Clk. Is directed to furnish him with a copy of this minute and sign it on behalf of the meeting.”</note> I left home to visit some meetings in Bucks and Abington quarters [in] Pennsylvania. Got to Mount Holly Meeting on Fifth Day which was very poor, low, little to be done. Here I met Hinchman Hains of Gabriel Daviss. Sixth Day had an appointed meeting for H.H. [Hinchman Haines] at Crosswicks. He took up almost the whole time and was much favoured. In the evening had a meeting at Bordentown. The few Friends there the house was crowded full and the weight fell on me and I believe it ended to general satisfaction. A Methodist minister was there and came to our lodging and said he wanted some friendly religious discourse with us and we parted friendly and respectfully he expressing great love and friendship for us.  7th Day had a meeting at Trenton. Religion seemed to be at a low ebb and hard getting along though. I hope we came off without loss. This evening I got to my friend Jonathan Kirkbride's.  My companions went on pursuant to their prospect down the river.</div>

The advice of divine wisdom is buy the truth and sell it not but those who prefer the gaiety, the vain customs and fluctuating fashions of the world renounce Wisdom for folly duty for disobedience and the reality of Enduring substance for the flattering delusion of Transitory enjoyments an as the inspired penman said: they that pursue lying vanities forsake their own mercies</div>
