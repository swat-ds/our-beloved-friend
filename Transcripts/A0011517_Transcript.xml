Liverpool 1 Month 10, 1772.
John and <persName key="w6wx87x7">Esther Hunt</persName> – My right dear and well beloved little cousins it is with feeling nearness and uniting regard I now salute you, desiring above all things you study obedience to the truth as it is manifested by the witness thereof not in any exalted notions of high imaginations but in the low valleys of deep humility where the secret mysteries is unsealed and the counsel and purpose of true wisdom respecting us open in a very intelligible manner, which as attended to with integrity and firmness strength is received a adequate for every trust reposed so as to come up in a faithful discharge of the same the reward whereof is peace and the running of rivers of joy by the fertile banks of Shiloh’s fountain where the soul drinks deep draughts and is refreshed grows strong being brought to the shepherds tents it feeds on heavenly bread and becomes well disciplined in its warfare as a good soldier is able to endure hardness and trials for truth’s cause. That this may be your happy experience dear children amidst all the crowding cares and cumbering concerns of a perishing world which fades as a flower and is seen no more it is with sweetness and satisfaction I often remember you and the pleasant moments we had together which length of time nor a distant land have not in the least diminished but rather increase the cordial notes of celestial converse in a language not easy to write with pen and ink but you I trust will be instructed in a school where you can read the characters of true friendship in other lines. I am with my dear companion well who joins in love which concludes me your very affectionate friend and cousin William Hunt
I give our very dear love to cousin Bobbe and wife. I should be glad to know if he went to Carolina also how he likes it. Salute <persName key="w6r525r2">Aaron Wills</persName> and his wife, cousin Samme Stokes and his wife, and others who ask for us. Farewell.
[Written sideways under this date]
This was the day I first gave up to say a few words in a public First Day meeting. In great diffidence, dread and fear a strong persuasion attended my mind that if I did give up to speak all and even <persName key="w6wx87x7">my wife</persName> would detest and abhor me (which I believe was the works of the enemy) for I found it quite otherwise for <persName key="w6wx87x7">my wife</persName> spoke comfortably and encouragingly and indeed I believe I needed it, for I was almost ready to sink so that some said they pitied me. But an healing peace followed of was such a reward of confirmation that I have thought since it never would be erased come on me what will or may, and this letter from my dear cousin I received when I came out of meeting which was an healing cordial to me. <note resp="transcr">The published version of Hunt’s Journal, 221-222, provides a slightly altered wording of this passage: This day, at our meeting, I first gave up to say a few words, I think, in great diffidence, dread and fear: a strong persuasion having attended my mind (which I since believe was the enemy's work) that if I did give up thus to expose myself in a public meeting, all would despise and abhor me, - even my bosom friend, and nearest connections: but I found it quite otherwise, for many of them, and especially , my wife, owned me in it, and spoke very comforting and encouragingly to me. The few words I had to communicate in that meeting were as follows: I believe it is needful, and would be profitable, when we are thus met together, diligently to watch against all such thoughts as we know ought not to have place in our minds. After I sat down, I felt such quietude, peace and composure, and a love that seemed to me to be new, that for some days I felt as if I had got into a new world. I loved not only my nearest connections, but all mankind, and even brutile creation, with a new love. This was such a confirmation of my being right, that I though it would never be erased, come on me what might. I felt as if I could turn my back on the world, and, if required, live like a hermit in the wilderness. Notwithstanding this confirmation of having been in my place at that time, I began to think that if ever it should be required of me again to say any thing in a public meeting, I should have a still more clear evidence of duty. Under this conclusion, I put off, and deferred speaking again for nearly a year; until I was in great danger of being quite bewildered on that hand. But as this kind of reasoning and false conclusion produced unsettlement, disquietude, and confusion of mind, so I found it safest to yield obedience to the clear manifestations of duty, without making a standard of my own.</note> </div>
